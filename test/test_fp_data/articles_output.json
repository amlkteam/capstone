The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who\u2019s argued the extradition was politically motivated.\u201cThe arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,\u201d the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize \u201cthe highly political nature of the arrest,\u201d the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn\u2019t attend Meng\u2019s arrest \u201cin an effort to avoid perception of influence.\u201dIn filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of \u201ccoordinated state misconduct,\u201d describing the handling of her arrest as \u201cso serious\u201d that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting \u201ca political persecution\u201d against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng\u2019s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained\u201cThis planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,\u201d the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng\u2019s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians \u2014 Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig \u2014 who\u2019ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Metcalf, Gabrielle Coppola and Ed Ludlow", "title": "'I'll let the haters hate': Nikola founder sees fortune surge to $7.4-billion amid criticism from pro-Tesla community", "description": "Time will tell if Nikola\u2019s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/nikola-founder-billionaire-criticism-tesla-community", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/trevor-milton-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 12, 2020 4:32 PM EDT", "content": "His company has sent his net worth soaring to $7.4 billion, but Trevor Milton is frustrated.The executive chairman of Nikola Corp. is under siege from skeptics of the company he started in 2014 with the goal of revolutionizing the trucking industry. The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they\u2019re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola\u2019s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.\u201cWe had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s not worth people thinking that we\u2019re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that\u2019s using people\u2019s money,\u2019\u201d Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.\u201cPeople started bashing us because they said, \u2018Oh you don\u2019t have deposits.\u2019 It\u2019s like, good hell, you can\u2019t win with these people,\u201d Milton said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you can\u2019t win.\u201dOf course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola\u2019s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model \u2014 bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront \u2014 has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola\u2019s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola \u2014 a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week \u2014 says he doesn\u2019t care.\u201cIt\u2019s really part of the noise,\u201d Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can\u2019t sell any shares for the next 12 months. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any emotion to those numbers because they\u2019re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.\u201dNikola\u2019s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn\u2019t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.\u2019s pickup franchise that\u2019s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn\u2019t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola\u2019s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.\u201cYou can\u2019t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,\u201d said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.\u201dMilton, who\u2019s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola\u2019s listing, saw Citron\u2019s post.\u201cHe never even bothered reaching out,\u201d Milton said of Left. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a s\u2014 about the facts.\u201dMilton\u2019s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit \u201claughable\u201d and said the claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola\u2019s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was \u201ctime to go all out\u201d and put Tesla\u2019s Semi into volume production.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like us, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums \u201ca humbling experience.\u201dHe then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture \u2014 an alarm-system company \u2014 for about $1.5 million. \u201cI thought I was on top of the world,\u201d he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that\u2019s part of the billionaire Agnelli family\u2019s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola\u2019s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company\u2019s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.\u201cCome back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s done,\u201d Milton said. \u201cI\u2019m an innovator, I\u2019ll let the haters hate.

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.\u201cThis is what I love about bankruptcy \u2014 there\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn\u2019t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.\u201cThe recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz\u2019s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,\u201d the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that \u201cthe common stock could ultimately be worthless\u201d and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.\u201cAs odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,\u201d said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University\u2019s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there\u2019s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That\u2019s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt \u2014 including Hertz\u2019 bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value \u2014 would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.\u201cA lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?\u201d Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling \u201cgiven the volatile state of trading in Hertz\u2019s stock.\u201d Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.\u201cIt is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn\u2019t buy those shares,\u201d said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV\u2019s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. \u201cI guess they\u2019re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.\u201dThe case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Wethe and Joe Carroll", "title": "Chesapeake's demise marks end of shale model that changed the world", "description": "Financial reality has at long last caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chesapeakes-demise-marks-end-of-shale-model-that-changed-the-world", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/chesapeake-energy-corp..jpg", "publishedAt": "June 12, 2020 7:03 AM EDT", "content": "It will go down as wildest of the shale wildcatters, the overreaching pioneer of fracking techniques that minted vast fortunes and, now, has left behind ruin.At long last, financial reality has caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp., avatar of the boom and subsequent bust of North American shale.Chesapeake\u2019s spiral toward oblivion accelerated this week with executives said to be preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing, signaling the imminent end of Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler\u2019s 7-year campaign to turn around the troubled gas explorer. For a company that\u2019s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale\u2019s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first \u2014 and won\u2019t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale\u2019s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it\u2019s unclear who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake\u2019s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. \u201cExtreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,\u201d Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that\u2019s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable \u2014 and therefore, worthless \u2014 by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company\u2019s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon\u2019s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC\u2019s decades-long grip on the world\u2019s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.\u201cThey were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,\u201d said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.\u201dGordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move \u2014 intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas \u2014 occurred just in time to expand the company\u2019s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn\u2019t find buyers.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Claire Ballentine", "title": "Stocks rebound as investors focus on buying the dip over virus fears", "description": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-primed-for-losses-after-u-s-slide-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/stocks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 5:56 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks as dip-buyers emerged for companies that bore the brunt of Thursday\u2019s selling.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world\u2019s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU\u2019s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the \u201cbuy box\u201d on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer \u2014 whether from Amazon\u2019s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant \u2014 is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It\u2019s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products \u2014 prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon\u2019s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants \u201cexpect the EU to clearly punish\u201d Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.\u201cAll merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants\u2019 data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAmazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked\u201d without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to \u201ccooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\u201d Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission\u2019s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven\u2019t always opened the way to more competition. Google\u2019s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn\u2019t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Charles Capel", "title": "Elon Musk weighs in on Tesla's stock again, this time with 'lol' and an internet meme", "description": "As Tesla share price soars, Musk tweeted a reference to an internet meme generally used to ridicule the stock market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/elon-musk-tesla-stock-tweet-lol-meme", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/elon-musk-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 9:48 AM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc. shares have been soaring in the weeks since Elon Musk said he thought they were too high.

The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who\u2019s argued the extradition was politically motivated.\u201cThe arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,\u201d the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize \u201cthe highly political nature of the arrest,\u201d the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn\u2019t attend Meng\u2019s arrest \u201cin an effort to avoid perception of influence.\u201dIn filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of \u201ccoordinated state misconduct,\u201d describing the handling of her arrest as \u201cso serious\u201d that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting \u201ca political persecution\u201d against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng\u2019s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained\u201cThis planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,\u201d the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng\u2019s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians \u2014 Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig \u2014 who\u2019ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds.

The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they\u2019re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola\u2019s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.\u201cWe had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s not worth people thinking that we\u2019re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that\u2019s using people\u2019s money,\u2019\u201d Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.\u201cPeople started bashing us because they said, \u2018Oh you don\u2019t have deposits.\u2019 It\u2019s like, good hell, you can\u2019t win with these people,\u201d Milton said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you can\u2019t win.\u201dOf course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola\u2019s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model \u2014 bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront \u2014 has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola\u2019s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola \u2014 a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week \u2014 says he doesn\u2019t care.\u201cIt\u2019s really part of the noise,\u201d Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can\u2019t sell any shares for the next 12 months. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any emotion to those numbers because they\u2019re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.\u201dNikola\u2019s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn\u2019t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.\u2019s pickup franchise that\u2019s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn\u2019t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola\u2019s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.\u201cYou can\u2019t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,\u201d said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.\u201dMilton, who\u2019s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola\u2019s listing, saw Citron\u2019s post.\u201cHe never even bothered reaching out,\u201d Milton said of Left. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a s\u2014 about the facts.\u201dMilton\u2019s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit \u201claughable\u201d and said the claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola\u2019s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was \u201ctime to go all out\u201d and put Tesla\u2019s Semi into volume production.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like us, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums \u201ca humbling experience.\u201dHe then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture \u2014 an alarm-system company \u2014 for about $1.5 million. \u201cI thought I was on top of the world,\u201d he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that\u2019s part of the billionaire Agnelli family\u2019s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola\u2019s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company\u2019s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.\u201cCome back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s done,\u201d Milton said. \u201cI\u2019m an innovator, I\u2019ll let the haters hate.

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.\u201cThis is what I love about bankruptcy \u2014 there\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn\u2019t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.\u201cThe recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz\u2019s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,\u201d the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that \u201cthe common stock could ultimately be worthless\u201d and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.\u201cAs odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,\u201d said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University\u2019s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there\u2019s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That\u2019s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt \u2014 including Hertz\u2019 bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value \u2014 would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.\u201cA lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?\u201d Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling \u201cgiven the volatile state of trading in Hertz\u2019s stock.\u201d Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.\u201cIt is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn\u2019t buy those shares,\u201d said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV\u2019s William S.

For a company that\u2019s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale\u2019s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first \u2014 and won\u2019t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale\u2019s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it\u2019s unclear who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake\u2019s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. \u201cExtreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,\u201d Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that\u2019s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable \u2014 and therefore, worthless \u2014 by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company\u2019s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon\u2019s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC\u2019s decades-long grip on the world\u2019s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.\u201cThey were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,\u201d said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.\u201dGordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move \u2014 intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas \u2014 occurred just in time to expand the company\u2019s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn\u2019t find buyers.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Claire Ballentine", "title": "Stocks rebound as investors focus on buying the dip over virus fears", "description": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-primed-for-losses-after-u-s-slide-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/stocks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 5:56 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks as dip-buyers emerged for companies that bore the brunt of Thursday\u2019s selling.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world\u2019s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU\u2019s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the \u201cbuy box\u201d on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer \u2014 whether from Amazon\u2019s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant \u2014 is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It\u2019s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products \u2014 prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon\u2019s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants \u201cexpect the EU to clearly punish\u201d Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.\u201cAll merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants\u2019 data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAmazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked\u201d without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to \u201ccooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\u201d Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission\u2019s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven\u2019t always opened the way to more competition. Google\u2019s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn\u2019t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Charles Capel", "title": "Elon Musk weighs in on Tesla's stock again, this time with 'lol' and an internet meme", "description": "As Tesla share price soars, Musk tweeted a reference to an internet meme generally used to ridicule the stock market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/elon-musk-tesla-stock-tweet-lol-meme", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/elon-musk-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 9:48 AM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc. shares have been soaring in the weeks since Elon Musk said he thought they were too high.

Operating income will decline as much as US$2.2 billion in the period, the company said in a statement.The guidance underscores the depth of the challenges for consumer-facing businesses from the coronavirus outbreak and worldwide lockdowns. The coffee seller, which is exploring new store formats to stimulate demand, is being closely watched as a barometer of customers\u2019 willingness to leave their homes and open their wallets as the pandemic subsides.\u201cThese numbers are a lot worse than the Street was expecting,\u201d said Michael Halen, senior restaurant analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cPeople expect some sort of crazy snapback but it\u2019s not going to materialize in restaurants.\u201dStarbucks plans to accelerate the rollout of its \u201cpickup\u201d store concept, with smaller-format locations that don\u2019t have customer seating. \u201cWhile we had originally planned to execute this strategy over a three- to five-year timeframe, rapidly evolving customer preferences hasten the need for this concept.\u201dThe pandemic has forced Starbucks to rethink its central concept of being a \u201cthird place\u201d away from work and home for customers to relax, it said.The company expects to open 300 net new stores this fiscal year in the Americas, half of its earlier estimate. That includes the closure of 400 company-operated ones over the next 18 months alongside the opening of a \u201cgreater number of new, repositioned stores in different locations and with innovative store formats.\u201dStarbucks is also examining its Canada operations and plans to restructure its business there over the next two years. The company said it will potentially close 200 additional stores there, with some of these changing locations.In China, the company says it is on track to add at least 500 net new stores this fiscal year, despite the virus impact.Chains dependent on breakfast sales, like Starbucks, have gotten hit disproportionately hard because there are so many fewer commuters on the road these days. Starbucks\u2019 price point is also higher than rivals like Dunkin\u2019, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Halen said, making it less well positioned heading into a pandemic-related recession.On top of that, a smaller share of its stores have drive-thrus than rivals. Lingering in the caf\u00e9 enjoying a coffee was a key part of the \u201cthird place\u201d experience, but that concept is \u201ctoast right now,\u201d Halen said.\u201cThey\u2019re really behind here. I don\u2019t blame the management team, the management team is excellent \u2014 it\u2019s just the impact of coronavirus is going to hurt them that much more because it\u2019s a caf\u00e9,\u201d he said.The shares fell as much as 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, the most intraday in more than a month. Starbucks had declined 6.3 per cent this year through Tuesday\u2019s close.The company\u2019s comments also dragged down peers, with an S&P index of restaurant stocks falling as much as 2.7 per cent, the most in almost a month. Starbucks, due to its size and propensity to give regular updates, is seen as a proxy for the industry.In the U.S., its critical home market, comparable sales were down 43 per cent in May, though things have been improving with each passing week, Starbucks said.

Revenue slumped to US$941.5 million. The outlook this period looks worse: The chain has been closed since March 17, meaning most of the second quarter has been lost. While California is allowing theatres to reopen this weekend, AMC has said it expects to be fully open globally next month.During the quarter, AMC also wrote down the value of its assets, including acquisitions, leading to a charge of US$1.85 billion and the large net loss.All of AMC\u2019s thousands of screens around the world have been dark for months amid the coronavirus lockdowns, and they will reopen under severe restrictions. In California, where AMC has more than 50 locations, cinemas can reopen June 12, but may only fill a quarter of the seats in order to maintain social distancing.The chain is also embroiled in a dispute with Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Pictures after the studio, one of Hollywood\u2019s largest, released \u201cTrolls World Tour\u201d to online audiences the same day the picture opened in theatres.

The number of users holding Whiting Petroleum Corp. grew roughly 10,000 in the last 24 hours.Two things the companies have in common: They\u2019ve filed for bankruptcy protection. And each saw their shares double to start the week.It\u2019s the same thing for Chesapeake Energy, as it prepares a potential filing. In the past, the court process usually wiped out equity shareholders. In this day and age, as small day traders salivate at any opportunity to get rich quick, a filing has apparently become a buy signal for many of them. There\u2019s evidence retail investor actions have become a decisive driver of price.\u201cRetail has a lot to do with it and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen institutional investors buying those kinds of stocks,\u201d said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk.

The fastest drop for the S&P 500 into a bear market, followed by the fastest 50-day rebound in nine decades. Mom and pop scrambling to the right side of the recovery trade, while the advice of Wall Street legends falls flat. A health-care crisis forcing one of the deepest recessions, and in the midst of it, equities emerging unscathed.In a market as bizarre as this, it seems only fitting that the next step would be a growing affinity for companies that can\u2019t pay their debts.According to website Robintrack, which uses Robinhood\u2019s data to show trends in positioning but isn\u2019t affiliated with it, individual investors on the app have been flocking to bankruptcy-protected companies in droves. (The site says it downloads popularity data each hour for every stock directly from Robinhood via a public application programming interface, or API. A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment for this story.)Of course, interest in these stocks isn\u2019t flowing solely from Robinhood clients. But the app is a lens into retail interest, particularly among younger investors, because unlike other popular brokerages, it\u2019s possible to see holdings of its users in real-time. Some of the rallies in these shares may also be due to short covering.Robintrack\u2019s data show 159,000 users now hold Hertz stock in some form. That\u2019s a record high, and up from 37,000 users a month ago. Over the last three days, the car rental firm has seen the largest surge in popularity on the platform. Right now, more users on the investing app hold bankrupt Hertz than do Netflix Inc.Call it crazy, but don\u2019t call it dumb. In the three sessions through Monday, Hertz shares surged 577%, just weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy. Trading volume in the stock has surged to an average of 197 million shares a day in June \u2014 more than 60 times what was typical in 2019.Chesapeake Energy has seen a similar turn. The oil company jumped 182 per cent on Monday, and after markets closed, news broke that the firm was said to be preparing to file for bankruptcy. More than 20 million shares changed hands, the most turnover on record for the stock in a single day, Bloomberg data show. In recent days, Chesapeake\u2019s popularity with users of Robinhood ballooned to 38,000 \u2014 a gain of 9,000.Same with Whiting Petroleum, a shale driller that went bankrupt in April. The number of users holding shares of the company rose to a record 50,000 this week.

That compares with US$31 billion during the 2008-2009 recession.The grim forecast comes as airlines seek to gradually restart operations with the pandemic beginning to recede. Industry debt has jumped by about US$120 billion, a level many carriers will be unable to sustain without governments stepping in to convert borrowing into equity, the trade body said.

The drop including non-passenger sales may be US$419 billion.Losses will amount to between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of revenue depending on the region, with no prospect of a return to profitability until 2022 at the earliest even if there\u2019s no second wave of coronavirus infections.Airlines are set to end the year with about US$550 billion in total debt, IATA forecast. That means the sector\u2019s borrowings next year will be 16 times earnings even on an Ebitdar basis, stretching from 4.6 times in 2019.There is no comparison for the dimensions of this crisisWhile some carriers may be able to cope by raising fresh equity themselves, stretched balance sheets are likely to lead to many states buying stakes, it said.

The 42 per cent surge from a March low is the best advance over an equivalent time-frame since 2009 for the MSCI ACWI Index that includes stocks in both the emerging and developed world. The gauge is now trading at 20 times next year\u2019s profits, the most expensive since 2002.\u201cThis rally is a function of government support being thrown behind the economy,\u201d said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cThere are key risks that could lead to more volatility ahead over the short term, which is why we continue to hedge our portfolios on the downside while still looking for opportunities to add risk for the medium to long term.\u201dSo far bulls are in charge. U.S. stocks just crossed an important psychological milestone of recouping this year\u2019s losses. Asia\u2019s equity benchmark just posted its seventh straight day of gains, the longest streak in more than two years. And euro-area shares are on course for their best monthly gain since 2015.Factors including a wall of money from the guardians of global economies, the easing of lockdowns and the shockingly positive employment numbers in the U.S. are drawing more buyers to participate, picking up cheaper sectors and adding more fuel to the rally. Yet caution still abounds with some investors increasing hedges for potential volatility ahead.\u201cThe risk of a correction will rise if investors continue to price in a rapid recovery, especially for sectors that are vulnerable to another wave of infections or an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.In another sign that the rally is stretched, global share-price gains in the past month have purely come from multiple expansion as earnings forecasts have barely budged since May. Adding to that is the fact the MSCI world measure has been in overbought territory since the start of the month, with the relative strength gauge on the index reaching the highest since January, which is considered a bearish signal by some.Meanwhile, speculative excess has surged to the highest in at least 20 years among U.S. options traders, a negative for stocks over the medium term, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. And a time-honored strategy of hedging stocks with government bonds has become questionable now that bond yields have plummeted thanks to policy easing across the world.\u201cIf everyone is holding stocks just to pass on to the next greater fool, and if the greatest fool is a central bank with infinite liquidity to buy them, then, yes, prices will keep going up,\u201d according to a note from Rabobank on Tuesday.With files from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Leslie Patton and Joe Deaux", "title": "Food makers are burning through cash to hoard ingredients for fear of more supply chain disruptions", "description": "This is a striking shift in strategy for food companies that for years built up just-in-time inventories, which minimize storage costs", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/food-makers-are-burning-through-cash-to-hoard-ingredients-for-fear-of-more-supply-chain-disruptions", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/goldfish-crackers.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 9, 2020 12:22 PM EDT", "content": "Hoarding cash during a pandemic might seem prudent, but America\u2019s packaged food companies are finding it\u2019s better to stock up on stuff they can sell.Businesses are spending more on raw materials like oats and sugar so they can maintain production in case supply lines get disrupted or imports are held up.Campbell Soup Co., the maker of Goldfish crackers and Pacific broths, is buying more ingredients amid a boom in demand for pantry staples. Bobo\u2019s, a Boulder, Colorado-based producer of snack bars and toaster pastries, has stocked up on organic oats, sugar and coconut oil, Chief Executive Officer TJ McIntyre said in an interview.\u201cWe just wanted to have an insurance plan for our business. If we ran out of oats, we\u2019d be in trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a first-time situation like this pandemic, there\u2019s a lot of questions we can\u2019t answer.\u201dHis company is currently buying about 50 per cent more of its main ingredients. This affords it an extra 90 days to solve any potential supply-chain hiccups.This is a striking shift in strategy for food companies that for years built up just-in-time inventories, which minimize storage costs. It also underscores the lessons that were learned after the coronavirus pandemic upended supply chains and sparked concerns over shortages of some ingredients.Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that food companies are bringing in more raw materials and packaging to help guarantee they can meet demand from retailers, where stocks of goods have fallen.\u201cRetail has below average inventory, they\u2019re trying to get as much as they can from producers,\u201d Moskow said.More money tied up in physical goods may also mean fewer new products \u2014 referred to as \u201cinnovation\u201d in the industry. Saffron Road, for example, recently cut two ramen bowls because they didn\u2019t sell as well as other items and it\u2019s cheaper to focus on core offerings. This represents another big change for food companies, which had prior to COVID-19 resorted to new, experimental products \u2014 like Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s mayochup \u2014 to create buzz.One of the things weighing on the minds\u2019 of consumers and scientists alike is whether cooler weather will cause coronavirus infections to spike again \u2014 potentially creating another boom in grocery demand. Second waves of the virus have been reported in China, South Korea and Hong Kong.Saffron Road, which makes frozen beef bulgogi meals and chickpea masala meal pouches, is buying 50 per cent more inventory than before \u2014 and has plans to boost purchases even more later in the year, CEO Adnan Durrani said. It\u2019s a risk to cash flow, he said, but one that\u2019s worth taking amid a surge in demand.The company will double its inventory heading into September, in case there\u2019s another spike in demand tied to rising COVID-19 cases again. He hopes, of course, this isn\u2019t the case.\u201cWe saw frozen foods go up dramatically during COVID,\u201d Durrani said. \u201cHopefully we flatten the curve.\u201dTaika, a canned coffee startup in San Francisco, has loaded up on ashwagandha powder \u2014 a plant-derived ingredient used in its coffee that\u2019s seen limited supply recently because it\u2019s sourced from India. With lockdowns there limiting the producer\u2019s ability to ship, Taika is now holding about six months of supply instead of just three months before the pandemic hit, founder Kal Freese said.\u201cFor small business, you end up having more capital tied up in inventory,\u201d he said.Campbell, which has seen a surge in demand for pantry staples including Prego pasta sauce and Kettle potato chips, has stocked up on certain ingredients to make sure it doesn\u2019t run out, CEO Mark Clouse said in an interview on June 3. The company is betting consumer demand will remain high \u2014 it now sees sales from continuing operations rising as much as 6.5 per cent this year, a big jump from its previous range.\u201cDemand has remained very elevated,\u201d Clouse said. \u201cSo our production and supply chain is really running flat out. We are working non-stop in a way that\u2019s practical and safe to create some cushion as it relates to inventory.\u201dGokhan Egilmez, an associate professor at the University of New Haven, agrees that higher demand is likely to persist. He predicted the pandemic will \u201ccontinue to cause radical transformations\u201d across industries until a vaccine or treatment is found.\u201cAs we all know, the pandemic already shifted consumption habits,\u201d Egilmez said. \u201cPeople may still find it not appealing to dine out or order from outside.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mike Dorning", "title": "Food shortages loom as outbreaks move from meat plants to bakeries, fruit, vegetable and dairy facilities", "description": "More shortfalls of individual food items and ingredients are likely in the months ahead unless the virus's spread is slowed at food-processing plants", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/food-shortages-loom-as-outbreaks-move-from-meat-plants-to-bakeries-fruit-vegetable-and-dairy-facilities?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/peas.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 9, 2020 10:55 AM EDT", "content": "A caravan of vehicles decorated with black ribbons and memorial pictures crawled through Yakima, Washington, last week to mark the death of David Cruz, a 60-year-old fruit warehouse employee who died after contracting coronavirus. The county, a hub of agricultural activity where workers jam into often crowded factories to package apples and other foods, has the highest per capita infection rate on the West Coast.It\u2019s a grim reality that\u2019s playing out across the country as COVID-19 spreads beyond the meat plants that have captured the national spotlight. At least 60 food-processing facilities outside the meatpacking industry have seen outbreaks, with more than 1,000 workers diagnosed with the virus, according to a new study from Environmental Working Group.These are the first national numbers of their kind. The advocacy group compiled its figures using local media reports because there are no federal agencies reporting the data. The true total is almost certainly higher. Fruit and vegetable packers, bakers and dairy workers are risking infection as the virus spreads through processing plants where employees deemed essential have mostly remained on the job during the pandemic, sometimes labouring in close quarters.\u201cAt our workplace, we were not ready for this virus. We didn\u2019t talk about it. We didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Paula Zambrano, a 61-year-old who works part time as a fruit sorter for Borton & Sons in Yakima. She was so concerned by an outbreak at the plant in April that the she didn\u2019t come in for three weeks, but then she had to return to support herself.\u201cPeople are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe live from our work. We are surviving from our wages. If we have children, how will we feed them?\u201dBorton & Sons didn\u2019t respond to voicemail messages left for John Borton, an owner and director of business operation, and Eric Borton, director of business development.People are infected and they come to work. They keep quiet about itAmerica\u2019s food suppliers have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks of any industry outside health care. Dozens of meatpacking workers have died, with thousands falling sick. The virus has also spread among employees at farms, where in all likelihood cases will keep climbing as more than half a million seasonal migrants spread out across the nation as the summer harvesting season ramps up.In addition to the human tragedy, the outbreaks also expose the vulnerability of America\u2019s food supply. The meat industry was already plunged into crisis with plant shutdowns that sparked grocery-store shortages. Even as that situation eases, more shortfalls of individual food items and ingredients are likely in the months ahead unless the virus\u2019s spread is slowed at food-processing plants, said Kevin Kenny, chief operating officer of Decernis, an expert in global food safety and supply chains.There are about 1.7 million workers at food and beverage manufacturing facilities, of which roughly 500,000 are at meat processors, according to a 2018 U.S. Census Bureau survey.Unions, advocacy groups and experts have said that employers haven\u2019t done enough to keep workers safe, with protective gear including face masks and gloves not being widely distributed until infections had already started to spread. Conditions inside plants can be crowded, and fast-moving processing lines may not allow enough space for social distancing. The largely immigrant labour-force also faces tough living conditions, with cramped housing \u2014 sometimes in employer provided bunkhouse-style dormitories that can sleep four to 10 to a room.About 35 per cent of food processing and dairy facilities have had at least one confirmed COVID-19 case, according to an International Brotherhood of Teamsters survey in May of union locals representing 79 plants. Roughly 80 per cent of employers weren\u2019t testing for the virus and more than a quarter of the workplaces didn\u2019t allow employees to physically distance themselves 6 feet apart, the survey showed.The Teamsters union is planning a national \u201ccall to action\u201d on Wednesday with demonstrations in almost 30 cities for better protection of food supply-chain workers.Still, the Teamsters have seen a \u201cmarked decline\u201d in reports of outbreaks at union-represented food processing facilities in the past several weeks as employers have established more robust safety procedures, said Rome Aloise, director of the union\u2019s dairy and food processing divisions. Union-represented employers are doing more no-touch temperature testing, strict adherence to safety protocols, including use of protective gear, and placing portable sanitation stations in workspaces, Aloise said.\u201cNon-union counterparts aren\u2019t doing the same things,\u201d he said.Zambrano, the fruit worker in Washington, said her employer was initially slow to implement measures but now takes temperatures as employees enter work, provides masks and maintains social distancing.Industry trade groups say that employers have invested heavily in measures to protect workers against infection risk while continuing to operate to maintain the nation\u2019s food supply.But employers have also run into issues because of shifting direction from authorities on proper protective measures. For example, fruit packers were initially told masks were unnecessary and were encouraged to donate inventories for use by health care workers, said Jon DeVaney, president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Employers were then confronted with short supplies of protective equipment when the advice changed, he said.\u201cWe have to stay open to supply essential goods for the American people,\u201d said Geoff Freeman, president of the Consumer Brands Association. Companies have taken many steps to protect workers, including providing protective equipment and by implementing \u201caggressive\u201d measures to make sure sick employees who stay home are compensated, he said.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration included food-processing facilities in jointly issued industry-specific guidance for manufacturing. Freeman said more protocols are needed, including, as one example, direction on what portion of positive cases in a workforce should trigger a plant shutdown.\u201cMake no mistake: We cannot eliminate the risk. The challenge for us is to mitigate the risk,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou have different companies approaching this in different ways. The more we have federal clarity, the more we can have consistency.\u201dLabour advocates are pressing for stronger action to protect workers. Scott Faber, the Environmental Working Group\u2019s senior vice president for government affairs, called on the Trump administration to impose mandatory safety standards to protect food industry workers, help procure protective equipment and provide federal aid to help retrofit plants to protect workers.\u201cFood processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fed, but the Trump Administration has failed to ensure they are safe,\u201d Faber said.Food processing workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, are taking enormous and largely avoidable risks to keep the rest of us fedIn Washington, workers at the company where Cruz had worked, Allan Bros. Inc., held a strike starting on May 7 to demand better protections. Cruz participated in a demonstration May 8, but was sick by the next day, according to Edgar Franks, political director of Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the local union.After three weeks, a deal was reached between workers and Allan Bros. The company \u2014 located in Naches, just outside of Yakima \u2014 agreed to provide masks to employees and to follow CDC guidance on coronavirus.

Hertz Global Holdings Inc.\u2019s are well above where they were before the company went bankrupt. But no stock in the automotive sector is a better indication of equity-market exuberance than Nikola Corp.The aspiring battery-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell truck maker debuted on the Nasdaq last week following a reverse merger with a blank-cheque company headed by a former General Motors Co. executive and board director. It\u2019s forecasting zero revenue for 2020 and its first US$1 billion year won\u2019t be until 2023.Ford Motor Co., by comparison, is expected to report about US$115 billion of revenue for this year. And yet Nikola, whose stock more than doubled Monday, traded up another 24 per cent to as high as US$90.71 in early trading Tuesday, giving the company a richer market capitalization than the almost 117-year-old maker of the F-150.Skeptics have long questioned the market\u2019s valuation of Tesla, which has yet to post an annual profit. But by pushing Nikola\u2019s market cap to US$26 billion at Monday\u2019s close, investors have taken appraisals of zero-emission vehicle manufacturers named after a celebrated Serbian-American inventor to another stratosphere.\u201cNikola\u2019s No. 1 goal is stable growth over time,\u201d Trevor Milton, Nikola\u2019s executive chairman, said in an emailed statement. The 38-year-old said several factors could be behind the stock\u2019s gain and cited examples including his tweeted announcement that the company will start taking reservations for its Badger pickup.Starting five years ago, when Milton founded Nikola, through the end of last year, the Phoenix-based company has lost about US$188.5 million. It\u2019s planning to start delivering the Tre battery-electric semi truck next year, followed by two fuel cell-electric models in 2023.The Badger model that Milton said may have gotten the market excited on Monday might not actually make it into production. In Nikola\u2019s public-offering filing, the company said it is focused on making Class 8 heavy-duty vehicles and doesn\u2019t expect to build the Badger unless it finds an established manufacturer to partner with.A spokesperson for the company said Nikola will announce a partner in the near future, without giving more specifics.Last week, Milton ceded the chief executive officer job to Mark Russell, a former COO of metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. who has been president of Nikola since February 2019. VectoIQ Acquisition Corp., the company Nikola merged with, is led by Steve Girsky, a former GM vice chairman who helped lead the carmaker out of bankruptcy.Nikola had about US$86 million in cash at the end of last year. Prior to the stock listing, it had raised more than US$500 million of private capital, though that includes a US$150 million in-kind contribution from CNH Industrial NV, the truck maker linked to Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family. CNH also invested US$100 million cash in Nikola last year.The partnership with CNH includes a 50-50 venture in Europe that aims to start producing battery-electric trucks in Germany in the first half of next year and a North American alliance that Nikola will fully own.Nikola is planning to build a 1-million-square-foot facility south of Phoenix and start making trucks in 2021. It\u2019s expecting to reach full production of about 30,000 fuel cell-electric vehicles in 2027 and 15,000 battery-electric vehicles the following year.Although Nikola touts reservations for 14,000 fuel cell-electric trucks that it says are worth about US$10 billion of sales, those are far from done deals. The company told prospective investors in April that it was negotiating with strategic fleet partners to convert pre-orders into binding contracts with deposits.While times are good for Milton \u2014 his fortune now stands at US$9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index\u2014\u00a0he still covets something Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk has: a blue check mark on Twitter.Then again, Milton may want to be careful about seeking notoriety on Musk\u2019s favourite social-media platform.

While Connor is seeking more tie-ups across the firm\u2019s key pillars of Canada, the U.S., Asia and global asset management, he sees the pandemic stifling activity in the near term.\u201cNot a lot of transactions take place because sellers are trying to figure out where they stand and are trying to consolidate their positions and they don\u2019t want to sell at depressed values, and buyers are trying to figure out where they stand,\u201d Connor said in the interview Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of transactions in the next six months.\u201dSun Life shares have slumped 13 per cent this year, compared with a 21 per cent decline for the S&P/TSX insurance industry index.The company is interested in deals in the seven Asian markets where it operates, including increasing stakes in joint ventures and striking partnerships with banks to distribute its insurance products, known as bancassurance. The firm would like to strike a bancassurance deal in Hong Kong along with other opportunities, even amid growing tensions with China that have some observers questioning the city\u2019s future as an Asian financial hub.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing Hong Kong as being an area that\u2019s going to have problems in terms of a Canadian company that\u2019s been there for a long time, that understands the market and understands the people and already has a business in China,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain said in the interview. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s finding your way through all the noise, but there\u2019s lots of business opportunities.\u201dSun Life sees Hong Kong as offering long-term growth opportunities and a springboard for additional business with mainland China in the Pearl River Delta \u2014 which includes China\u2019s tech center of Shenzhen and the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou \u2014 through greater business access and an opening up of immigration across the economic region, said Strain, who previously spent five years overseeing the Asia business out of Hong Kong, where Sun Life has operated for 128 years.Closer to home, Connor\u2019s interests include expanding in group benefits in the U.S. and building up its Canadian retail wealth management, though he said there isn\u2019t much to buy currently in an industry dominated by Canada\u2019s large banks. He also reiterated interest in rounding out Sun Life\u2019s alternative asset manager, SLC Management, with a deal in below-investment-grade private credit.\u201cIf you look at pension funds and institutional investors, generally speaking, the last decade has been one of moving up the risk curve in an ever-lower-return world,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe think there will be demand there, just because of the economics, and we think COVID is actually going to accelerate that demand.\u201dSLC Management deepened its real estate exposure with last year\u2019s combination of Bentall Kennedy and GreenOak, creating a global real estate investment management adviser and services provider with US$48 billion of assets under management.

For Bombardier, that average price is now sitting at about 53cents for the three months leading up to June.A departure from the index could hurt demand for Bombardier\u2019s shares as exchange-traded funds drop the stock. Other managers must also decide whether to keep the shares. \u201cA portfolio manager must determine how closely they want to track the index and make a call on number of shares,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson.Bombardier is aware of the guidelines for index inclusion but it won\u2019t speculate on whether it will be removed in the upcoming review, Jessica McDonald, a company representative said.S&P Dow Jones Indices releases its quarterly review within the first 10 days of the rebalancing month, which would be June 12, spokesman Raymond McConville said.Bombardier\u2019s shares have continued their downward spiral despite a corporate revamp initiated by former chief executive officer Alain Bellemare. The stock has lost almost all of its value in 20 years.The Montreal-based company was once seen as a Canadian champion of the industrial sector and a source of pride for Quebec. It made everything from snowmobiles to commercial aircraft but is now a shadow of its former self after ceding its marquee jet program, now known as the A220, to Airbus SE and agreeing to sell its rail business to French train maker Alstom SA in the face of more than $10 billion in debt.The company\u2019s market capitalization peaked at $36.2 billion in the summer of 2000. Today it\u2019s $1.4 billion.Bellemare\u2019s restructuring means Bombardier has made an all-in bet on the corporate jet market. That left the company, now led by Eric Martel, particularly exposed as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered travel globally and slashed corporate spending. Still, it\u2019s possible that sales of private jets, which allow for physical distancing among passengers, may come back faster than commercial travel.The company\u2019s shares jumped as much as 28 per cent Tuesday after Bank of Nova Scotia upgraded its stock rating to the equivalent of a hold. Analyst Konark Gupta said in a report he sees \u201csome green shoots\u201d in the macro and industry indicators he monitors. Bombardier\u2019s share price, which was at $0.64 as of 10:40 a.m. in Toronto, is still far from the criteria to stay included on the S&P/TSX Composite.Last week, the company announced that it plans to eliminate 2,500 jobs at its aviation division following a slump in demand for business jets.

The talks with lenders come almost seven years to the date that Lawler assumed the helm at the Oklahoma City-based company at the behest of Carl Icahn and O. Mason Hawkins, at the time two of the driller\u2019s biggest investors.Chesapeake is negotiating a restructuring support agreement that could see holders of its so-called FILO term loan take a majority of the equity in bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. The support agreement remains fluid and the terms could change, the people said.Chesapeake, which owes about US$9 billion, is debating whether to skip interest payments due on June 15 and invoke a grace period while it talks with creditors, the people said. No final decision has been made. The company has also begun soliciting lenders to provide debtor-in-possession financing to fund its operations during bankruptcy, according to one of the people.A bankruptcy filing by Chesapeake would reverberate well beyond its investors and employees because it will put millions of dollars in pipeline, fracking and other contracts at risk.The stock, whose shrunken price was boosted by a 1-for-200 reverse stock split earlier this year, more than tripled at one point Monday to US$84.75, then plunged to US$52.05 after Bloomberg reported the potential Chapter 11 filing. A bankruptcy typically wipes out existing shareholders.Chesapeake, the brainchild of McClendon and co-founder Tom Ward, was one of the first to aggressively combine breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and high-intensity hydraulic fracturing to shale rock long ignored by geologists looking for gas or oil.That gamble provided trailblazers like Chesapeake, Continental Resources Inc. and EOG Resources Inc. a head start over industry titans like Exxon and Chevron Corp. in dominating the burgeoning shale sector. Years later, companies like Exxon would pay dearly to gain footholds in shale.Lawler\u2019s efforts to rescue Chesapeake have included across-the-board belt-tightening at the company\u2019s once-lavish corporate headquarters, along with tens of thousands of job cuts. A years-long campaign to transform the gas giant into an oil company never gained traction.The driller recorded US$8.5 billion in impairments for the first three months of the year as the value of its fields, a sand mine and other assets plunged along with commodity prices.Chesapeake was already in a precarious position before the COVID-19 outbreak sent crude demand plummeting. At its height more than a decade ago, the producer was a US$37.5-billion juggernaut commanded by McClendon, an outspoken advocate for the gas industry. But Chesapeake\u2019s success at extracting the fuel from deeply buried rock contributed to a massive gas glut.Kirkland & Ellis and Rothschild & Co. are advising Chesapeake, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The FILO lenders are organized with Davis Polk & Wardwell and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, the people said. Franklin Resources Inc. is organized with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, according to one of the people.Representatives for Rothschild, Perella Weinberg and Franklin declined to comment, while representatives for Kirkland & Ellis, Davis Polk, and Akin Gump didn\u2019t immediately comment.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Claire Ballentine", "title": "S&P 500 erases losses for the year as markets climb on reopening optimism", "description": "'I wouldn\u2019t be betting against equities at this point'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-futures-climb-again-this-morning-as-investors-mull-how-much-further-to-take-this-rally", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 8, 2020 4:14 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks climbed, with the S&P 500 erasing its losses for 2020, as easing lockdowns bolstered economic optimism.

Per-capita output will contract in more than 90 per cent of countries, the biggest share since 1870. The economy will rebound in 2021, growing 4.2 per cent, it said.This is the first recession since 1870 triggered solely by a pandemic, and it continues to manifest itself\u201cThis is the first recession since 1870 triggered solely by a pandemic, and it continues to manifest itself,\u201d Ceyla Pazarbazioglu, the World Bank\u2019s vice president of equitable growth, finance and institutions, told reporters by phone. \u201cGiven this uncertainty, further downgrades to the outlook are very likely.\u201dThe decline in per-capita income may push 70 million to 100 million people into extreme poverty, she said.Advanced economies will shrink 7 per cent, led by a 9.1 per cent contraction in the euro area, the lender said. Emerging and developing economies will shrink 2.5 per cent, their worst performance in data that starts in 1960, it said. Those with limited health-care capacity, deeply integrated global value chains, heavy dependence on foreign financing and extensive reliance on international trade, commodity exports and tourism are likely to be the hardest hit.While the World Bank sees China\u2019s economy eking out 1 per cent growth this year, the lowest rate since 1976, it forecasts India\u2019s will shrink 3.2 per cent. U.S. GDP may contract 6.1 per cent.The World Bank presents two alternative scenarios. In one, where the COVID-19 outbreak persists for longer than expected, requiring the continuation or reintroduction of restrictions on movement, the global economy would shrink almost 8 per cent this year. If control measures can be largely lifted in the near term, the contraction would be 4 per cent \u2014 still more than twice as deep as the global financial crisis of 2009.\u201cThe global recession would be deeper if bringing the pandemic under control took longer than expected, or if financial stress triggered cascading defaults,\u201d the World Bank said.The International Monetary Fund will update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. In April, the fund forecast a 3 per cent contraction for this year, though chief economist Gita Gopinath has since said that the outlook has worsened. The methodologies are different because IMF aggregate forecasts are based on purchasing-power parity, which gives more weight to developing economies, while the World Bank uses market exchange rates.Most central banks have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve starting an unprecedented range of emergency programs providing as much as US$2.3 trillion in loans.

That\u2019s the first gain since June 2019.The government added stimulus measures such as tax rebates to attract consumers back to showrooms, while automakers that shuttered operations amid the coronavirus outbreak now offer generous discounts. The pandemic exacerbated a sales slump that\u2019s in its third year, with an economic slowdown, trade tensions and stricter emission standards weighing on demand.Global automakers spent billions of dollars expanding in China in recent decades, and manufacturers such as Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG remain undeterred in their effort to tap the market\u2019s long-term growth potential, including for electric vehicles. The German manufacturer said this month it will become the biggest shareholder of battery company Guoxuan High-Tech Co., and it seeks a 50 per cent stake in a Chinese EV partner.A decline in sales of new-energy vehicles, including electric cars, also slowed, PCA said. NEV sales fell 26 per cent, following a drop of 30 per cent in April and 49 per cent in March.Tesla was the top-selling NEV brand with 11,095 vehicles, PCA said. The U.S. company started deliveries from its massive new Shanghai factory around the start of the year. Monthly registrations of new Tesla vehicles in China have fluctuated this year amid the virus, from a low of 2,314 in February to a high of 12,710 in March, according to data from state-backed China Automotive Information Net.After growing rapidly for several years, electric-car sales have lost momentum since the government moved to limit subsidies in mid-2019. The pandemic also hurt demand, and slumping oil prices have made gas guzzlers more competitive. The government still considers electric cars a priority, and has added a slew of fresh stimulus measures to help the industry recover.Full-year car sales in China may fall about 10 per cent following big declines at the height of the virus crisis earlier this year, PCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu said on a media call.

Hydrogen fuel cell company Ballard Power Systems Inc. is second with a 75 per cent gain.These tech stars may not have a catchy acronym like FAANG in the U.S., BAT in Asia or even WAAAX in Australia but investors have flocked to these names due to their stronger growth outlook compared with other sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cThere\u2019s a view that the pandemic should actually help accelerate tech adoption in a bunch of different areas because ultimately technology is one of the only ways to mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic,\u201d Thanos Moschopoulos, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone.Kinaxis has become \u201cespecially topical\u201d given its supply chain management software can help companies track global shipments amid the havoc caused by COVID-19, and to help mitigate the challenges, Moschopoulos said.Last month, the Ottawa-based company reported a 15 per cent increase in revenue and maintained its 2020 guidance, which included a sales forecast that\u2019s about 10 per cent to 12 per cent higher than 2019.With the bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S. mortgage industry, low interest rates are keeping things busy for Real Matters. The Markham, Ontario-based provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries has seen increased refinancing volumes as central banks cut rates to pump financial markets with liquidity during the global recession.Sky-high valuations suggest things may be moving too fast, too soon. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P/TSX Info Tech Index is about double the five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that because interest rates are where they are, at record low levels, that dynamic justifies higher valuations. Tech on a relative basis is looking better than a lot of other sectors,\u201d Moschopoulos said.Still, recent price action in North American stock markets suggest investors are shifting away from tech and into more cyclical sectors as confidence in the recovery builds. Unexpectedly strong jobs data from Canada and the U.S. on Friday amplified this theme.At about 9 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, the tech sector\u2019s impact is still small compared to the nation\u2019s banks, miners and energy companies.So while their shares have surged this year, helping offset some of the losses on the S&P/TSX Composite, the benchmark remains in the red for the year \u2014 for now.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bobby Ghosh", "title": "Saudi Arabia's economy is in tatters.

It is, after all, the combination of his ill-timed oil war against Russia with the COVID-19 crisis that has left the kingdom facing the steepest contraction in a generation.Although relatively few Saudis have contracted the virus, the substantial economic damage will likely force the crown prince to make deep cuts to his \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan.The centrepiece for an ambitious agenda of economic and social reforms, that plan was conceived in the throes of the last oil slump. Its goal was to wean Saudi Arabia from its dependence on hydrocarbons and create more opportunity for private enterprise. But four years on, more than 60 per cent of government revenue still comes from oil, and low prices have halved the take.MBS, as the crown prince is commonly known, has ordered austerity measures \u2014 most prominently, the tripling of the value-added tax and cuts to bureaucrats\u2019 allowances. But these will sharpen the economic downturn by reducing consumption and inhibiting private-sector investment. In turn, this will compound the frustrations of unemployed Saudis, the majority of them women, who had been promised a shot at prosperity in the prince\u2019s vision of the country\u2019s economic future.The harsh realities facing Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler come on top of problems that have bedevilled him since he emerged from relative obscurity five years ago, when his father\u2019s coronation gave him his first taste of real power. They will compound the challenges of ruling a petrostate with a growing population and diminishing wealth. As he prepares to guide his country through the post-pandemic period, his chances of a prosperous and peaceful reign depend on his ability to undo some of the damage he has himself wrought, and to avoid repeating his mistakes.The portents allow for little optimism: As headstrong as he is young, MBS has demonstrated little interest in, much less capacity for, changing his ways. But the past few months have served up important lessons he\u2019d do well to heed.Perhaps the most sobering of these is that he can no longer take for granted the Saudi-American relationship. A bullying April phone call from President Donald Trump forced him to end the oil war. It also revealed the limitations of MBS\u2019s strategy of courting America\u2019s First Family while disregarding growing hostility in Congress. If that wasn\u2019t the mug of cold water in the face he needed, the removal of two Patriot missile batteries one month later should have been a bucket: Only seven months had passed since a missile and drone attack, most likely by Iranian proxies in Yemen, cut the kingdom\u2019s oil output by half.Scarier still, the withdrawal of American defences comes just as Iran hopes to buy more sophisticated weapons, with other world powers eager to sell. MBS might reflect that this was hardly an opportune moment to pick a fight with Russia, which is determined to block U.S. efforts to extend an arms embargo on the Islamic Republic.Nor can he hold out much hope of a change of heart in Washington with a change of occupant in the White House. Democratic candidate Joseph Biden seems inclined to mend fences with Iran.The corollary to the loss of unstinting American support is the need for friends closer to home. Of the eight countries with which Saudi Arabia has land borders, relations with two \u2014 Yemen and Qatar \u2014 are hostile; with two others, Oman and Iraq, they are cool to frosty. If much of this is MBS\u2019s doing, much is also within his power to fix.The embargo on Qatar, possibly the crown prince\u2019s most egregious foreign-policy misstep, is easily lifted. MBS should be able to overcome any resistance from the other prime mover in that feud, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi. After all, their close friendship didn\u2019t stop the latter from extricating himself from the war in Yemen. In Oman, the crowning of a new sultan offers the prospect of warmer ties, if MBS is willing.Relations with Yemen and Iraq are fraught, not least because of Iran\u2019s malevolent pot-stirring. But the pandemic has allowed for a ceasefire in Yemen, and the new prime minister in Baghdad is no Tehran puppet.Beyond the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia\u2019s relations with developing countries hinge on its ability to hand out loans or largesse, which its reduced economic circumstances will now constrain. Chancy investments by the Saudi wealth fund don\u2019t buy much goodwill \u2014 or economic soft power, come to that.In much of the developed world, MBS will struggle to shake off the ghost of Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered Washington Post columnist. Even in the middle of a pandemic, a fresh European chorus of condemnation greeted efforts by the Saudi wealth fund to buy an English soccer club, and again when Khashoggi\u2019s family in Riyadh announced that it was forgiving his killers. The lesson for the crown prince is that, in the social-media age, efforts to move on from a controversy \u2014 by, say, a Saudi court\u2019s exoneration of MBS\u2019s close associate \u2014 can often have the opposite effect.Such backfires may not matter much within Saudi Arabia, where the media is tame and criticism easily cowed. But even there MBS faces a new challenge: How to preserve his popularity with ordinary Saudis while imposing the harshest austerity measures they have ever endured.Citizens asked to moderate their lifestyles might look askance at the extravagance of their leaders \u2014 especially those who keep a US$450-million Leonardo da Vinci painting in their US$320-million superyacht. Businessmen struggling with high taxes and lower consumption might ask why the state wealth fund is trying to buy Newcastle United, instead of pumping life-saving investments into the Saudi private sector.Nor can MBS count on civil-society organizations to serve as a salve \u2014 or a pressure valve \u2014 for the public. He has jailed many of the country\u2019s best-known social activists, and allows few outlets for free discourse. In addition to the traditional means of stifling dissent, new methods like social-media harassment have been brought to bear against critics.Public dissatisfaction with economic conditions can also feed dissent in high places, and embolden foreign critics. European lawmakers, for instance, are pressuring the Saudi government to release one of MBS\u2019s cousins, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz; along with his father, he has been held without charge for two years. A lobbying firm in Washington has started a campaign for the prince\u2019s release.There\u2019s also a quieter effort on behalf of Saad Aljabri, a former top intelligence official in self-imposed exile since 2017. Saudi security forces have reportedly arrested two of his children and one of his brothers, hoping to coerce him to return home. Aljabri is highly regarded in Western intelligence circles, and especially in Washington.Under MBS, Riyadh has responded disproportionally to such pressure. Two summers ago, when Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland expressed concern over the arrests of Saudi activists,\u00a0MBS suspended diplomatic ties and new trade deals with Canada. Under the current economic circumstances, he is unlikely to impose trade restrictions on Europe.Domestic resentments won\u2019t yet lead to anything like a revolution. MBS\u2019s control over the state\u2019s security apparatus makes his position virtually impregnable. But as the austerity regime drags on, his image as a popular prince at home will be hard to sustain. The same goes for any lingering hope he may have of being seen as a great reformer abroad.That this should happen in 2020 must be especially galling: This was to be a year of international triumph for MBS, culminating with the leaders\u2019 gathering of the Group of 20 nations in Riyadh for their annual summit in November. Although King Salman is nominally the host, it was expected to be the crown prince\u2019s show.At the G20 summit in Osaka last summer, President Donald Trump spared Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s blushes by praising his \u201cspectacular\u201d leadership, and ignoring calls to hold Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler accountable for Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Relations between the president and the prince may have turned sour since then, but MBS likely hopes that Trump will again save him from embarrassment as he did in Osaka. In Riyadh, the assist will be indirect: The result of the U.S. presidential election will dominate all discussions at the margins of the gathering, saving the prince from unwelcome attention.But as the Arab world\u2019s most important leader, the crown prince can\u2019t evade the spotlight for long. Saudis adjusting to post-pandemic realities will be looking to MBS to guide them through the most difficult period in their country\u2019s recent history, and the wider world will be watching to see if he can redeem himself.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Bloomberg has reported that the Justice Department and Texas are already examining Google\u2019s dominance of the digital advertising market. The Justice Department and a coalition of states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton have been investigating the company for a year, and the DOJ has begun drafting a lawsuit, which could be filed in the coming months. It would kick off one of the most significant antitrust cases in the U.S. since the government sued Microsoft Corp. in 1998.The investigations have been wide-ranging and are looking into various parts of Google\u2019s business. States including Utah and Iowa are focusing on search, according to people familiar with the matter. Texas is looking at the digital ad market and related technology.Google handles the majority of online searches in the U.S., with Microsoft\u2019s Bing, DuckDuckGo and other providers trailing far behind. Google Search is free for users, but the company\u2019s lead helps it charge thousands of businesses high prices for ads that run above the free web listings in results. Last year, that business generated almost US$100 billion in revenue.\u201cWe continue to engage with the ongoing investigations led by the Department of Justice and Attorney General Paxton, and we don\u2019t have any updates or comments on speculation,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said. In the past, the company has said that online competition is just a click away.The Federal Trade Commission previously investigated whether Google stifled competition in the market for online search advertising, but it closed the probe in 2013 after the company agreed to relatively minor changes. However, portions of communications between FTC commissioners and staff later showed that staffers recommended bringing an antitrust lawsuit against Google.Weinberg said the questions he has fielded recently about requiring Google to present users of its tech alternatives to its own search engine suggest that\u2019s something the government could include in a possible future settlement.\u201cThat\u2019s one direction we think has a decent probability,\u201d he added. The Justice Department declined to comment. Attorneys general in Utah and Iowa didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In Europe, Google was fined a record US$5 billion for antitrust violations in 2018. As part of that ruling, the company is required to give consumers using phones that run its Android operating system a choice of different search engines and web browsers. Competing services must bid in an auction to be included in a \u201cchoice screen.\u201d\u201cCould this be a precursor to similar changes in the U.S.?\u201d Mark Shmulik, Toni Sacconaghi and other analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to investors earlier this week.Europe\u2019s remedy has gone through various iterations and some rivals have argued that having to pay to be included in the choice screen is unfair.Ecosia, a not-for-profit search engine based in Germany, boycotted the auction. DuckDuckGo participated in the most recent auction, but said it may not be able to compete if prices rise.\u201cThis auction remedy, proposed by Google, was constructed to make Google money, not to provide meaningful consumer choice,\u201d DuckDuckGo said in a blog post last week.It suggested scrapping the auction and said that an unpaid \u201csearch preference menu\u201d has increased competition already in Russia.

That\u2019s partly due to\u00a0aggressive actions taken by the\u00a0Federal Reserve to mitigate the crisis, though one can\u2019t deny that there exists an\u00a0astonishing disconnect between stock prices\u00a0and the economic realities of many Americans right now.Costco wouldn\u2019t be a typical crisis-era bet for Buffett in this regard. The shares are up, not down, this year and its operations have carried on throughout the pandemic. Zoom, Netflix, TikTok, Costco \u2014 the retailer is\u00a0right up there with those services that have become centerpieces of the stay-at-home recession.But in so many other ways a Costco deal would still be classic Buffett.\u00a0For starters, Buffett already likes Costco. Berkshire has owned the stock for two decades; its\u00a01 per cent stake is valued at about US$1.3 billion currently. Buffett\u2019s business partner Charlie Munger, the 96-year-old vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, also sits on Costco\u2019s board. Last year, Buffett\u00a0even publicly marvelled at Costco\u2019s in-house Kirkland brand, which at that point had US$39 billion of annual sales. \u201cHere\u2019s somebody like Costco, establishes a brand called Kirkland and it\u2019s doing US$39 billion \u2014\u00a0more than virtually any food company,\u201d including Kraft Heinz Co., he said. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz\u2019s largest shareholder.Costco has proven during this crisis that it has a durable brand and a wide competitive moat, two of the key attributes Buffett looks for. More than 90 per cent of Costco\u2019s U.S. club members renew, and globally the rate is nearly as high at\u00a088 per cent. Those warehouse memberships are a predictable source of cash flow, almost akin to Berkshire\u2019s insurance float that Buffett uses to invest. While the majority of Costco\u2019s 787 warehouse clubs are in the U.S. and Canada, it does have\u00a0locations in\u00a0Mexico, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It\u2019s also\u00a0expanding in China, offering Buffett exposure to the country\u2019s growing middle class.Costco\u2019s same-store sales have risen 6.5 per cent on average for the last 10 quarters, topping other U.S. mass retailers including Walmart Inc., the parent of Sam\u2019s Club. Costco also generated more than US$1,300 of sales per square foot in fiscal 2019 \u2014 more than any of its peers.The share price has gotten a bump from all the panic-shopping, and at 34 times earnings, Costco\u2019s valuation certainly isn\u2019t what Buffett would call cheap. But Costco should continue to fare well in a\u00a0post-virus America, especially if\u00a0it leads some residents to ditch cities for suburbs and spend more time at home. After the meat and toilet paper shortages, more shoppers\u00a0may even turn to bulk-buying to be better prepared for future lockdowns or shortages.The biggest hurdle to a takeover\u00a0is that Costco\u2019s market value is US$137 billion \u2014\u00a0precisely the amount of cash Berkshire has available.\u00a0Berkshire\u2019s last major acquisition was\u00a0Precision Castparts, a maker of airplane engine parts, for US$37 billion in 2016. After years spent searching for his next target,\u00a0Buffett signalled recently that his hunt is on hold, suggesting that he thinks the crisis could still get worse before it gets better. \u201cThe cash position isn\u2019t that huge when I look at the worst-case possibilities,\u201d he told a stunned audience last month that tuned into the live-streamed annual meeting\u00a0expecting to hear something a little more upbeat or at least hopeful from the Oracle of Omaha. (1)Berkshire could simply increase its stake in Costco, a stable holding that\u00a0pays a 70-cent quarterly dividend. But it wasn\u2019t all that long ago that Buffett spoke of the possibility of an acquisition Costco\u2019s size. \u201cIf a US$100 billion deal came along that Charlie [Munger] and I really liked, we\u2019d get it done,\u201d he said in May 2018. With Buffett set to turn 90 in August, it\u00a0would be uncharacteristic to not want to do one last splashy transaction.It also wouldn\u2019t be the first time Berkshire acquired one of its stock holdings. Berkshire\u00a0owned shares in Precision Castparts before that deal. It also took a stake in the BNSF railroad in 2007 and kept adding to that position until it eventually purchased the whole company. Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Geico even dates back to the 1950s when Buffett first bought shares\u00a0and\u00a0as a curious young investor\u00a0began a serendipitous\u00a0friendship\u00a0with the insurer\u2019s former\u00a0CEO, Lorimer Davidson, as Buffett often retells it.Whether as a takeover candidate or stock pick, Buffett\u2019s best option may be right under his nose.(1)One well-known shareholder, Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, even exited its Berkshire position, deciding it can find worthwhile investing opportunities faster than Berkshire can at this rate.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

They have fallen more than 75 per cent this year.Two years of selling assets has left Bombardier particularly exposed to the vagaries of the private-jet market amid a wide-reaching recession.

The company is seeking to reduce debt to about US$4 billion by the end of this year, it said at the time.The decision to sell its transportation unit to Alstom, valuing the business at US$8.2 billion, remains a key underpinning for its financial risk profile amid the uncertainty of coronavirus, which has disrupted operations and contributes to cash burn that may approach US$3 billion this year, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Geudtner wrote in a note last week.The company saw its junk bonds rise to their highest levels in about six weeks amid a wider market rebound.

The gains were across most industries and provinces, though largely driven by higher employment in Quebec, the province hardest hit by the pandemic.The numbers echo recent high-frequency data, which had signalled a recovery is underway, with job postings increasing and more Canadians reporting an increase in work at the end of May. They will be a relief to policy makers who had been scrambling to inject hundreds of billions in cash into the economy to keep it afloat. Still, just under 5 million remain without work or substantially reduced hours with the jobless rate at postwar records.\u201cThe surprisingly positive readings on employment paint a more optimistic picture of the early part of the recovery, but there\u2019s still a long road back,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a research report. \u201cThe increase in May only represents 10 per cent of the COVID-19-related job losses and absences that occurred over the prior two months.\u201dThe pick up in May follows an unprecedented loss of about 3 million jobs in March and April. More than 2 million employed Canadians continue to experience much lower hours worked than pre-crisis.The unemployment rate ticked up to 13.7 per cent in May, from 13 per cent in April, as people returned to the labour force.Economists in a Bloomberg survey expected a loss of 500,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 15 per cent.Canada\u2019s currency extended gains on the result, appreciating 0.7 per cent to C$1.3406 against its U.S. counterpart at 9:46 a.m. Toronto time. Yields on two-year government bonds rose 2 basis points to 0.35 per cent.The better-than-expected report suggests the governments programs to cushion the blow to the labour market are working. By mid-May, 179,000 businesses had applied for the government\u2019s 75 per cent wage subsidy program. The pace of applications to Canada\u2019s emergency income benefit program has also decelerated in recent weeks, suggesting the worst of the layoffs and job losses is over.In addition to the employment pick up, Statistics Canada said the number of people who worked less than half their usual hours dropped by 292,000. That means the number of Canadians who have either lost their job or worked substantially fewer hours has fallen to just under 5 million, from about 5.5 million in April. Hours worked rose 6.3 per cent in May from the prior month but were still 23 per cent below February\u2019s levels.The surprise jump reflects the cautious reopening of the economy across provinces. By the time the employment survey was taken from May 10 to May 16, some provinces including B.C., Saskatchewan and Quebec allowed some non-essential businesses to reopen.Quebec accounted for nearly 80 per cent of May\u2019s gains, the statistics agency said. In contrast, Ontario -\u2013 where the economy remained largely shut until May 19 \u2013- saw more losses.In the early days of the reopening, employment rebounded more strongly among goods producers, the data show. The goods-producing sector added 165,000 jobs versus 125,000 in services. Lower-wage jobs also rebounded more, particularly in retail trade, accommodation and food services.Demographically, male employment increased more than twice as fast as that for women, consistent with the more rapid increase in the goods-producing industry. Women were among the earliest victims of the COVID-19 related job losses in March and the latest data suggest they are slower to recover as well.\u201cThe kinds of jobs that reopened earlier tend to be more male dominated in employment and also that more women don\u2019t know how to get back to work because they don\u2019t know what to do with their kids because schools aren\u2019t open,\u201d said Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation.Women with at least one child under age 6 showed a slower return to work than women with older children. Statistics Canada said it will continue to monitor labourmarket outcomes for men and women with children in the months to come. Youth are still suffering heavily from the COVID-19 economic shutdown. While employment recovered by 30,000 for those aged 15-24, the cumulative job losses for this age cohort are still a whopping 843,000 from February to May.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Spencer Soper", "title": "Elon Musk tweets 'time to break up Amazon,' escalating feud with Jeff Bezos", "description": "Musk's post came in response to a tweet from a writer who said his book about COVID-19 was being removed from Amazon for violating unspecified guidelines", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/elon-musk-amazon-feud-jeff-bezos", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/elon-musk.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2020 3:26 PM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc.

The steepening phenomenon is typically a signal of improving growth prospects, and riskier assets such as stocks are certainly rallying. Yet some investors are more wary about what it says about inflation expectations, with U.S. activity merely giving a hint of bottoming out from what\u2019s likely the deepest slump in living memory.The risk that the market is starting to grapple with is that in the pandemic\u2019s wake, stagflation \u2014 a troublesome combination of tepid growth and accelerating inflation \u2014 takes hold in the years ahead and vexes markets as it did in the 1970s. Cash is flooding into funds that invest in inflation-protected securities, and breakeven rates, another gauge of consumer-price expectations, are ticking back higher.Not that this is all bad, necessarily. The Fed would actually welcome a move away from the deflationary angst that took hold at the peak of the market turmoil in March, as its unprecedented monetary easing is aimed at doing just that. Yet the prospect that inflation will quicken at the same time that job creation sputters is far from ideal. With most bond investors braced for low rates for years to come, the spectre of yields finally taking flight could prove perilous.\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis will be remembered for many things, and among them will be the long-awaited return of inflation in developed markets,\u201d said Oliver Harvey, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.In a world of zero rates, inflation may seem like a distant threat \u2014 and those who worry about it are a minority in the market, with inflation prognosticators having been proven wrong time and time again over the past decade. But it may be the side effect of the pandemic cure being administered by central banks and governments.The Fed\u2019s balance sheet alone has swelled above US$7 trillion from about US$4 trillion in early March, and more steps may be coming, such as yield-curve control. Expectations for such a move are contributing to the steepening push.For Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, the Fed\u2019s programs propping up the corporate bond market will lead companies to become even more leveraged, reducing productivity and crimping growth.Corporations\u2019 reliance on Fed support means the central bank will \u201chave to continue providing liquidity to the system until inflation rates pick up to levels that probably would be viewed as unacceptable by most participants of the Fed today,\u201d Minerd said on Bloomberg TV Wednesday. The long-run implication is \u201ca period of stagflation.\u201dThe steepening yield curve, coming as equities are surging, looms large on the radar of Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist and portfolio manager at AlphaSimplex Group. For her, it warns of growing concern about inflation, a topic she says she\u2019s hearing more buzz about.\u201cMy apocalypse scenario \u2014 whether or not it can happen \u2014 in terms of where we are positioned now is clearly stagflation,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be a reversal of all the trends we\u2019ve been following. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a short-term scenario, but that\u2019s the scary long-term one.\u201dMy apocalypse scenario \u2014 whether or not it can happen \u2014 in terms of where we are positioned now is clearly stagflationThe result would be equities remaining on the front foot initially as the economy reflates, then heading lower, bond prices falling, commodities rising and dollar weakness, she said.The last time stagflation gripped the U.S. in the late 1970s, 30-year yields eventually doubled in a matter of years, on their way to a record high above 15 per cent in the early 1980s. The long bond yields about 1.55 per cent now, up from a historic low of just under 0.7 per cent reached in March.Others are more sanguine about growth, but still see the makings of inflation as global supply chains get clogged.Telltale signs can be seen in the latest data. Alongside the record decline in a key measure of U.S. consumer prices in April, the cost of food at home surged 2.6 per cent from the prior month, the most since 1974, as Americans stocked up at grocery stores. In the U.K., pet food at one point jumped 26 per cent on an annualized basis, according to Deutsche Bank calculations.Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus \u201cin and of itself has a very, very important inflationary dynamic to it,\u201d said Jeffrey Rosenberg, a portfolio manager of BlackRock\u2019s Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund. He sees inflation as a risk starting in about six months, and one that will be marked by a steepening curve.\u201cThe COVID crisis is first and foremost a massive, massive supply shock\u201d which then \u201chad morphed into a massive, massive demand shock,\u201d he said.Even as the curve steepens, market proxies for inflation projections show investors foresee U.S. consumer prices below 2 per cent for decades, although they\u2019re well above their March lows. Forward inflation swap rates in the U.S. and the eurozone, favoured by policy makers for long-run inflation expectations, have also rebounded yet remain below long-term averages.BlackRock Inc.\u2019s US$20 billion iShares TIPS ETF added more than US$700 million last month, the most in more than two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.U.S. inflation markets are too pessimistic, says Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Corp.\u201cThe market\u2019s view should be intolerable at the Fed,\u201d Cabana said. \u201cThey will have to be credible in keeping rates low to generate upside inflation risk premium.

For Yale University economist Stephen Roach, this backdrop combined with the growing debt pile bodes for higher inflation in the years ahead.\u201cWhen you couple the trend of offshoring to re-shoring with a likely resurgence of pent-up consumer demand if we get a vaccine, you have a lethal combination of higher costs,\u201d\u2018 said Roach, who famously warned about the U.S. housing bubble more than a decade ago at Morgan Stanley, among other bearish predictions.\u201cAnd the job destruction occurring is set to be a lasting feature of this post-COVID world,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout labour income from employment, the recovery is going to fall short and that is the stag part of the stagflation scenario.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "One of Canada's biggest private lenders looking to sell 11% of loan book", "description": "Bridging Finance Inc. has already sold $30 million in loans to ride out the coronavirus crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/one-of-canadas-biggest-private-lenders-to-sell-11-of-loan-book", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/bridging-loans.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2020 10:22 AM EDT", "content": "One of Canada\u2019s largest private lenders is looking to sell as much as 11 per cent of its loans to help ride out the coronavirus crisis.Bridging Finance Inc. has already sold $30 million in loans (US$22 million) and plans to offload a further $170 million to other direct lenders and institutional investors, Chief Executive Officer David Sharpe said by phone. The firm, which has $1.8 billion in assets under management, froze redemptions on its funds in April.\u201cWe are selling some loans at par value to improve liquidity,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cWe are doing it in a prudent fashion, as we need to keep cash on hand for the revolvers and for foreign-exchange effects, and once we are comfortable with our liquidity, we will lift the gating of the funds.\u201dThe company lends to small and mid-sized companies involved in everything from milling flour to delivering groceries. Most of its funds are invested in collateral-based bridging loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.The pandemic, which forced the shutdown of many smaller businesses the sector typically lends to, is a major test for the asset class. The market has swelled to about US$820 billion globally from US$200 billion before the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s likely to see consolidation as some lenders forced to contend with problem loans, and less well-positioned firms struggle with portfolios or lack of scale.In Canada, Fiera Capital Corp. started calling investors in April to inform them it could only fulfill a little more than 20 per cent of redemption requests in its Diversified Lending Fund, which has about $1.5 billion under management.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately $2.6 billion.

Toronto-Dominion Bank had the largest increase at 29 per cent, while Bank of Nova Scotia remained the biggest lender with $21.6 billion in loans.The banks\u2019 rising exposure comes as impaired energy loans almost doubled, topping $2 billion. Energy firms have been hard hit this year as global oil prices plummeted, with some grades even briefly turning negative in April as measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus hammered worldwide demand.\u201cWe\u2019re clearly seeing the impact of price wars and supply-demand considerations, storage considerations beginning to play havoc on some producers,\u201d Toronto-Dominion Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in a May 28 interview. \u201cIn the last few weeks we\u2019re watching prices recover with some degree of hope that things will continue to get better here.\u201dWith the price plunge making much of their output unprofitable, Canadian oil and gas producers have taken steps to conserve cash. They\u2019ve reduced production, cut operating costs, slashed at least $8.5 billion in planned capital spending and tapped credit lines to help them weather the downturn.Those drawdowns were the main reason for the 22 per cent increase in energy lending at Royal Bank of Canada, according to CFO Rod Bolger.\u201cThe growth was driven by higher draws on existing facilities and we did make select new lending facilities to existing investment-grade clients where the risk-return was appropriate given the low oil prices,\u201d Bolger said in a May 27 interview.Most of Royal Bank\u2019s exposure is to exploration and production companies and loans are secured by the value of proven and producing reserves, Bolger said. Still, the Toronto-based lender had the highest gross impaired loans among the Canadian banks, at $664 million.Bank of Montreal posted the second-highest total for impaired energy loans, at $616 million.\u201cIn our oil and gas portfolio we do have some signs of stress just given the weaker price of oil that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months \u2014 it\u2019s not totally new and we\u2019re managing through it,\u201d CFO Tom Flynn said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before as a bank and we\u2019re confident in our ability to manage through this stress that the industry is in.\u201dCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CFO Hratch Panossian said he is seeing more downgrades and impairments in the oil-and-gas sector, reflecting price weakness, but called the bank\u2019s energy portfolio \u201crelatively stable.\u201d\u201cOnly about half of it is in the exploration and production space and our clients do have some hedging as well that protects them in the short term,\u201d Panossian said in a May 28 interview. \u201cWe remain comfortable with the space. Our clients are strong and managing through this and we\u2019re committed to continuing to support them.\u201dWhile bank figures show increased borrowing, many producers are seeing the total amount of credit available reduced. That\u2019s particularly true of producers\u2019 reserve-based credit lines, which are tied to the value of their oil-and-gas reserves and are adjusted regularly to account for current prices.This year\u2019s first adjustment period, known as redetermination, is going on now, and early results show banks have been shrinking those credit lines in response to falling prices.At least five Canadian oil-and-gas producers have announced results of their redeterminations, and all have had their credit lines cut. Notably, oilsands producer Athabasca Oil Corp. had its credit facility reduced by 65 per cent to $42 million, while natural gas driller NuVista Energy Ltd. saw its line cut by 14 per cent to $475 million.At least seven producers have extended the date on their redetermination processes to June 30 because of volatile prices. Five of those have had their available credit reduced on an interim basis before the final evaluation is competed.\u201cThe best-case scenario for our junior E&P companies this year is likely a small reduction in credit capacity, a slightly higher cost to borrow, and the ability to continue to act autonomously from the influence of its banks,\u201d Stifel FirstEnergy analyst Cody Kwong said in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Home sales bounce back in Toronto, Vancouver after shutdowns", "description": "Sales in Toronto up 53%, new listings up 48% and prices up 4.6%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/home-sales-bounce-back-in-toronto-vancouver-after-shutdowns-2?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 3, 2020 12:04 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s residential real estate market is bouncing back from coronavirus shutdowns.Home sales and prices rose in Toronto in May from the near freeze-up of activity caused by the pandemic in early spring.Sales in and around Toronto rose 53 per cent from April on a seasonally adjusted basis as new listings surged almost 48 per cent and the average price climbed 4.6 per cent, according to Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.

Chinese buyers have also canceled an unspecified number of U.S. pork orders, one of the people said. Private companies haven\u2019t been told to halt imports, according to one of the people.The halt is the latest sign that the hard-won phase-one trade deal between the world\u2019s two biggest economies is in jeopardy. While Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month reiterated a pledge to implement the agreement that was inked in January, tensions have continued to escalate since then amid a standoff over Beijing\u2019s move to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.Beijing\u2019s move eroded the risk-on sentiment that had been prevailing over markets. S&P 500 Index futures gave up gains to trade 0.6 per cent lower, while U.S. 10-year bonds erased declines. The onshore yuan reversed its advance, while soybean futures in Chicago, which had been as much as 1 per cent higher, were little changed.The measures to halt imports come after President Donald Trump on Friday lobbed a barrage of criticism at Beijing after it moved to impose controversial new national security legislation on Hong Kong. Critics say it will crack down on dissent and undermine the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle that has kept Hong Kong autonomous of the mainland since the 1997 handover from the British.Cofco and Sinograin are China\u2019s key importers of farm goods. They had been making pricing inquiries for 20 to 30 cargoes of U.S. soybeans on Friday but held off on going through with purchases after Trump indicated he would punish Chinese officials, one of the people said. Beijing is waiting to see what steps Trump takes before deciding its next move, one of the people said.Nobody from the commerce ministry responded to a fax seeking comment. Officials from Sinograin and Cofco also didn\u2019t respond to calls.Trump said the U.S. would begin the process of stripping some of Hong Kong\u2019s privileged trade status, without detailing how many changes would take effect and how many exemptions would apply. He also promised sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials \u201cdirectly or indirectly involved\u201d in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, though stopped short of giving specifics.Equity investors had reacted positively to Trump\u2019s remarks, as he didn\u2019t provide any details or time-frame for what actions might come next. It\u2019s unclear how soon the U.S. would move on a range of options, from sanctioning Chinese officials to imposing tariffs on Hong Kong to attacking the territory\u2019s financial stability.While Trump has periodically threatened to call off the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, his top economic advisers have suggested it would continue. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Thursday that the trade agreement \u201cdoes continue to go on for the moment and we may be making progress there.\u201dThe two sides have traded blows over a range of issues from the coronavirus to Taiwan in recent weeks, and China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned during high-profile legislative meetings in Beijing that some in America were pushing relations to a \u201cnew Cold War,\u201d and urged the U.S. to give up its \u201cwishful thinking\u201d of changing China.China had agreed to buy U.S. farm goods worth about $36.5 billion for 2020 as part of the phase-one trade deal signed in January. However, the coronavirus outbreak roiled those plans, with China only managing to import $3.35 billion in American agricultural products in the first three months of the year, the lowest for that period since 2007, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Still, as China started to gradually reopen its economy from the virus-led lockdown, it had increased its pace of imports, including a more-than 1-million ton cargo of American soybeans in just two weeks in May, and rare purchases of U.S. soybean oil and ethanol.But then tensions between the U.S. and China began escalating, with Trump blaming the Asian nation for misleading the world about the scale and risk of the coronavirus outbreak.

Two-year government bond yields dropped 2 basis points to 0.29 per cent.Friday\u2019s report showed the downturn was broad-based, with household spending falling 9 per cent annualized, the most on record. The drop in consumption accounted for 5 percentage points of the 8.2 per cent annualized drop. Businesses scaling back inventories accounted for another 2 percentage points.The pullback from the consumer was also evident in a surge in the savings rate to 6.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the highest since 2001.Even though hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost jobs in the first quarter, household disposable income was up, reflecting an increase in government transfers. Canadians didn\u2019t spend those transfers however, putting them toward savings.Non-residential business investment came in much stronger than expected, recording just a 2.7 per cent annualized drop in the first quarter \u2014 a better performance than the previous three months when it dropped 4.8 per cent. There was little impact on housing investment, which was little changed in the first quarter.Government spending was weaker, posting a 3.8 per cent annualized drop, the most since 2013, from school closures and curtailed government administration.

It\u2019s the first time Twitter has taken action on Trump\u2019s posts for being misleading.Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can\u2019t let a more sophisticated version of that\u2026.That move came after a widower asked Twitter to delete Trump\u2019s tweets alleging, without evidence, a conspiracy theory that his late wife had been killed by cable news host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough. Twitter hasn\u2019t taken action on those tweets.Twitter shares fell 1.65 per cent in early trading in New York after Trump\u2019s tweet. Twitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.Social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook Inc. and Google\u2019s YouTube have been swept up in recent years in a broader backlash against tech in Washington, state capitals and even Europe.Trump has little authority to shut the businesses, which are also central to his re-election campaign and communications strategy with the public.

She said social media helps conservatives skirt the mainstream news media.\u201cThe president\u2019s saying please stop suppressing conservative voices,\u201d she said, before criticizing Twitter\u2019s fact check. \u201cI thought using outlets that are decisively and proudly anti-Trump to fact-check the president was maybe the richest piece of the whole thing.\u201dCongress is looking to develop a privacy law that would create more limits around how the companies can use data and what responsibilities they have to consumers regarding that information. The companies are already being regulated under California\u2019s strict new statute on data privacy.Lawmakers from both parties in Washington and the Justice Department are also weighing proposed changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which is prized by online platforms because it protects them from lawsuits for content posted by third parties. Some conservatives have attacked the provision for enabling what they see as the silencing of users\u2019 statements by the companies. The allegations have ramped up during the Trump administration, as the president and his supporters have occasionally clashed with platforms that they nonetheless rely on to spread their messages and grow their following.While the companies largely deny that they are biased and say they have focused on shutting down posts and users engaged egregious conduct such as threats or spreading harmful misinformation, Americans\u2019 constitutional rights to free speech mean that the companies are generally able to set the rules for how their private platforms are run and publish views without government pressure.In addition to questions about privacy and content, Facebook and Google are also the targets of wide-ranging antitrust probes by federal and state law enforcers. Under Trump, the Justice Department, which is among those investigating both companies, has faced allegations that its actions have been politically motivated. The most significant outcome of an investigation, however, such as proposed breakup of the companies, would have to be approved by a court.A congressional panel is also probing competition issues in the tech sector, focusing Facebook, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., but not Twitter.

While the index remains near its worst-ever readings recorded last month, the rise in confidence in recent weeks suggests negative sentiment may be finding a floor amid talk of reopening the economy. Sentiment around housing, however, remains at near-record lows.Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 responses.The polling suggests the mood is still dire, but with improvements on most questions.Regionally, the gains in sentiment have been mostly in Western Canada, aided by a recent rebound in oil prices and relatively fewer coronavirus cases \u2014 British Columbia, for example, has one of the lowest death rates in North America.

He also criticized the U.S. for slowing its nuclear negotiations with North Korea and warned it not to cross Beijing\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on Taiwan.The U.S.-China relationship has worsened dramatically in the past few months as America became one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which was first discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have clashed on a range of issues from trade to human rights, with Beijing\u2019s latest move to tighten its grip on Hong Kong setting up another showdown between U.S. President Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\u201cSome U.S. political forces are taking hostage of China-U.S. relations, attempting to push the ties to the brink of so-called \u2018new Cold War,\u2019\u201d Wang said. \u201cThis is dangerous and will endanger global peace.\u201dWang cautioned the U.S. \u201cnot to challenge China\u2019s red line\u201d on Taiwan, after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo broke with tradition last week and congratulated the island\u2019s President Tsai Ing-wen on her second-term inauguration. Beijing considers Taiwan a province.\u201cReunification between the two sides of the Strait is an inevitable trend of history, no one and no force can stop it,\u201d Wang said. China\u2019s defence ministry blasted a U.S. plan to sell torpedoes to Taiwan.And he blamed Washington for the stall in historic negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, saying China hoped to see continued interaction between the two sides. The comments came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u2014 who has faced questions about his health \u2014 made his first public statement in three weeks, ordering military leaders to increase the country\u2019s \u201cnuclear war deterrence.\u201d\u201cWe have seen some positive steps taken by the DPRK in the last few years towards de-escalation and denuclearization,\u201d Wang said. \u201cRegrettably, these steps have not been reciprocated in a substantive way by the U.S. side. This is the main reason for the ongoing stalemate in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.\u201dTensions spiked last week after China announced the NPC would write sweeping legislation into Hong Kong law to criminalize the harshest criticism of China and the ruling party. The move drew swift condemnation from pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, who defied virus-related social-distancing measures and rallied in the city center even as Wang spoke.Pompeo called the measure a \u201cdisastrous proposal\u201d and indicated that it could lead the U.S. to reconsider Hong Kong\u2019s special trade status.Wang on Sunday repeated China\u2019s stance that Hong Kong affairs were an internal matter and said the principle of non-interference must be upheld by all countries. He didn\u2019t directly address potential U.S. retaliation over the legislation.He also argued that the coronavirus pandemic showed how the world was a \u201cglobal village\u201d and needed to work together, while repeatedly rejecting foreign criticism of China\u2019s internal affairs.U.S. lawmakers have advanced several pieces of legislation targeting China in recent weeks with bipartisan support amid mounting calls for Beijing to be punished for its alleged failure to disclose information early on about the spread of COVID-19. The virus has cost almost 100,000 American lives and tens of millions of jobs.Xi said Saturday he won\u2019t let China return to its days as a planned economy, pushing back against U.S. criticism that the nation has failed to deliver on promised reforms.\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the understanding that we should not ignore the blindness of the market, nor should we return to the old path of a planned economy,\u201d he told political advisers gathered in Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Javier Blas", "title": "Global oil demand has yet to peak, energy watchdog predicts", "description": "\u2018Videoconferencing will not solve our energy and climate challenges\u2019 \u2014 IEA", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/global-oil-demand-hasnt-yet-peaked-energy-watchdog-predicts", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/oil-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 25, 2020 4:05 AM EDT", "content": "Global oil consumption hasn\u2019t peaked, the head of the International Energy Agency warned, throwing cold water on hopes the coronavirus will cap demand and reduce climate-changing emissions.\u201cIn the absence of strong government policies, a sustained economic recovery and low oil prices are likely to take global oil demand back to where it was, and beyond,\u201d Fatih Birol said in an interview.The world consumed last year nearly 100 million barrels a day of oil, and some in the energy industry believe that could mark the peak for global demand. Their hypothesis is that the coronavirus outbreak will trigger changes, like widespread working-from-home and less overseas travel, reducing consumption permanently.\u201cCould it be peak oil? Possibly. Possibly. I would not write that off,\u201d the head of British oil major BP Plc, Bernard Looney, told the Financial Times.If true, that would have huge implications for climate change as burning less oil would permanently reduce greenhouse emissions, easing the way to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. But Birol warned governments that the coronavirus will only reduce oil demand briefly, with consumption dipping in 2020 to about 91 million barrels a day, before rebounding in 2021 and beyond.\u201cBehavioral changes in response to the pandemic are visible but not all of them are negative for oil use. People are working from home more, but when they do travel, they are more likely to be in cars than public transport,\u201d he told Bloomberg News from Paris. \u201cVideoconferencing will not solve our energy and climate challenges, good government policies might.\u201dBirol is urging governments to use their economic recovery packages to fight climate change, spending on green energy to help to achieve the goals set in the 2016 Paris accord.The more ambitious target set under the Paris climate agreement \u2014 limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 will require annual global emissions to be reduced by about half by 2030 and to hit net-zero around the middle of the century. Without deep structural changes, emissions are expected to rise again when economies recover.The oil industry is making sweeping changes in an effort to adapt itself to the Paris climate goals, with major companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA promising to cut emissions significantly and investing more into renewable energy as they come under pressure from more ecologically conscious shareholders. Still campaigners warn the cuts are unlikely to be enough to keep temperatures from raising to dangerous levels.\u201cIf there\u2019s a strong economic recovery, American business consultants using Zoom will not compensate for 150 million new urban residents in India and Africa traveling, working in factories and buying products transported by trucks,\u201d Birol said.Birol drew parallels with the 2008-09 crisis, when oil demand also suffered a major annual drop, before consumption increased again. The economic recovery packages didn\u2019t focus back then on green energy and savings, missing an opportunity to tackle the challenge of climate change.The IEA, which advises the world\u2019s richest countries on energy policy, is sticking to its view that global oil demand will continue to increase over the next decade or so, before reaching a plateau around 2030. In a report published in November 2019, the agency said global petroleum consumption was likely to reach about 105 million barrels a day by 2030 and about 106 million by 2040 in the absence of new government policies.In its 2019 long-term analysis, the IEA assumed significant oil savings from the sale of new vehicles over the next two decades. The use of more fuel-efficient engines would knock out 9 million barrels a day of demand, while the growth of electric cars would displace about 4 million a day. But the current economic crisis is likely to reduce car sales for a while, keeping less efficient clunkers on the road.\u201cFewer car sales means older cars stay on the road,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Apps to book elevator rides, masks and staggered shifts: Toronto bankers get glimpse of new office normal", "description": "Cadillac Fairview, owner of TD Centre and RBC Centre, says office workers should brace for dramatic changes", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/rules-for-torontos-bankers-book-an-elevator-ride-wear-a-mask?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/banks-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 22, 2020 9:40 AM EDT", "content": "Elevator queues, mandatory masks and staggered start times may await Toronto\u2019s office workers when they start venturing back to North America\u2019s second-largest financial centre.These are among the measures Cadillac Fairview Corp.

The company is landlord to some of Canada\u2019s largest banks as the owner of office towers such as TD Centre and RBC Centre.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a gradual but steady climb back to normalcy,\u201d Sal Iacono, Cadillac Fairview\u2019s executive vice-president of operations, said in an interview.Ontario has been easing restrictions on business as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 2,000 people in the province, finally eases.Office workers should brace for dramatic changes, with numerous precautions to protect them and the public. Cadillac Fairview, owned by the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan which oversees 70 properties in Canada including the Toronto Eaton Centre shopping mall, is just one of the city\u2019s large landlords adopting new measures to make returning to work safe.Elevators will have limits of four people and Cadillac Fairview plans to add thin anti-microbial film over the buttons. It\u2019s looking to introduce digital apps so people can schedule their elevator rides instead of waiting in line, Iacono said, \u201cso that you know with certainty that you\u2019re not going to have to wait a long time in order to be able to access your floors.\u201dThe company is also working with tenants on ways to stagger start and end times for employees to avoid crowding in lobbies and common areas.\u201cIn order to be able to allow the maximum number of people to come into those office buildings, we\u2019re going to have to change our behaviours for a period of time,\u201d Iacono said.Building occupants at Cadillac Fairview office properties will be required to wear non-medical face masks or coverings in elevators and they\u2019ll be \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to wear them in common areas, including the underground PATH network that links downtown office buildings in Canada\u2019s largest city.Commercial landlords including Brookfield Properties and Oxford Properties Group have already put down social distance markings and signage throughout downtown. But the many bankers, investment managers, accountants and lawyers who typically populate Toronto\u2019s cluster of skyscrapers likely haven\u2019t seen them yet due to weeks of working from home.In the depths of the pandemic shutdown the number of people in office buildings were no more than 5 per cent to 10 per cent of normal levels, Iacono estimated. He got a first-hand look at how the city\u2019s core has become a ghost town a couple weeks ago during a visit to his office by the shuttered Eaton Centre to sign some paperwork.\u201cThe mall under normal circumstances has 53 million people a year going through it, so to see Toronto Eaton Centre as empty as it was on the day that I was there was a little dystopian,\u201d he said. \u201cI took the elevator up to my office and we had two people on our floor.\u201dEven with restrictions easing, Iacono doesn\u2019t anticipate a rush back to the office. Ontario has kept schools and daycares closed, which means a slow return for many workers.In markets that have reopened, Iacono is seeing between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of office workers returning at first, with that percentage increasing over time.\u201cI try to dispel the notion that on the first day that the government lifts restrictions in the market that everybody shows up back at the office all at the same time like any normal day pre-COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be the case.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canadian retail sales have plunged by about one-quarter over the past two months", "description": "Data out today showed retail sales down 10% in March and another 16% in April \u2014 both are record declines", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-retail-sales-plunge-in-first-weeks-of-pandemic-lockdown", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/closed-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 22, 2020 8:55 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian retail sales have plunged by about one-quarter over the past two months as the sector was hit by the pandemic induced shutdown.Retailers sold 10 per cent fewer goods in March than February, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa.

Now it can\u2019t find enough willing to make the journey.There is scant local interest in farmwork, so Canada\u2019s agriculture sector relies on nearly 60,000 foreign workers to make the journey north each year from countries like Mexico, Jamaica and Guatemala. This year, however, some migrant labourers are deciding to stay home to protect themselves from the coronavirus, resulting in a dearth in essential foreign labour.That leaves Canadian farmers desperate to fill a shortage of workers, despite facing the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s quickly become politicized, with the federal government forced to step in and opposition politicians calling for coronavirus aid programs intended for students and the unemployed to be tied to working in the fields.The government is \u201cexploring additional ways to shore up our domestic labour supply,\u201d said Marielle Hossack, spokeswoman for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough. \u201cWe continue to encourage employers to hire Canadians, and jobs are posted \u2014 and continue to be available \u2014 for Canadians who are interested.\u201dEven as the COVID-19 fallout forces Canada to reduce its new arrivals targets for immigration, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has implemented measures to try and lure seasonal workers north. They include rolling out exemptions from border closures, easing visa renewals for agriculture workers and providing $50 million (US$36 million) to cover mandatory quarantine costs.It\u2019s still not enough to convince more people to come. Political pressure is mounting to find an alternative labour source locally as Ottawa estimates the shortage at several thousands already with the growing season just beginning.For the four months to the end of April, 22,000 agricultural workers had arrived to take up jobs from the fruit orchards and vegetable fields of British Columbia to the wine-growing region of Niagara in Ontario. Of the 13,000 projected arrivals for the month of April, only 11,000 workers came.Syed Hussan, director at Migrant Workers Alliance for Change in Toronto, said the shortage is being compounded by travel difficulties and public health fears. In many cases the workers\u2019 countries of origin have fewer COVID-19 cases than Canada, and Canadian farms and facilities staffed by migrant workers have witnessed some of the largest workplace outbreaks.Foreign workers say that not all employers are following the government\u2019s health guidelines and they are worried about their health. One worker from Jamaica, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said this time was unlike the previous 12 years he made the journey. Instead of a commercial plane, he took a crammed chartered flight in April without quarantining for the mandatory 14-day period.Foreign workers say that not all employers are following the government's health guidelines and they are worried about their health\u201cThis year is very very different from previous because when we arrive this year, we have been told to keep safe of this COVID-19, but complying with all rules and regulations is difficult,\u201d he said.He lives in a house with six other men, sharing a kitchen and bathroom. He says the house doesn\u2019t meet health standards and the men have been relying on a local church to provide food donations. A fruit picker, he says he knows people in Jamaica who decided not to come to Canada out of fear of contracting COVID-19.Stringent workplace health and safety rules need to be in place and enforced to protect workers, according to economist Armine Yalnizyan, who said that they also need the right to refuse work if they feel they may get sick from unsafe practices.\u201cMigrant workers are not allowed to not work \u2014 if they don\u2019t work, they get deported,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re getting sick and they\u2019re not allowed access to care or any kind of income support when they are not working because they are sick.\u201dTwenty-three foreign workers tested positive for COVID-19 at a plant nursery in British Columbia this month, and migrant workers at meat plants in Alberta have been among the confirmed cases.A Mexican worker on a mushroom farm in Ontario said he\u2019s been under more pressure this season due to a shortage of labour both as a result of those not arriving and others who have gotten sick on the job. The farm has reported a number of COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks.The man, who also asked not to be named, lives with five others in a three-bedroom house on the farm. He says the company has given them masks to use for two weeks at a time and has recently implemented temperature testing. If the workers get sick, they have to quarantine at home and do not get paid. He makes $500 a week and uses that income to support his mother, wife and daughter back in Mexico.Migrants rights groups are calling for increased protections for workers, including stricter physical distancing and guaranteed pay if they fall ill. The government says it has already strengthened requirements and will punish employers who don\u2019t comply with new COVID-19 regulations with penalties of up to $1 million and a permanent ban on hiring foreign workers.With some provinces closing their borders to migrant labour entirely, the labour shortage shows no sign of abating. Instead, opposition politicians are pressing the government to tie part of its $9-billion student aid program to agricultural work.Shifting even some of that money away from direct payments to students and on to employers including farms would \u201cprovide relief for many of the front-line essential services and jobs for students in return for the money,\u201d said lawmaker Erin O\u2019Toole, who is vying for the leadership of the main opposition Conservative Party.Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government says it encourages unemployed Canadians to work in essential sectors including agriculture. But Nicole Brayiannis, deputy chairperson from the Canadian Federation of Students, says that\u2019s impractical.\u201cA lot of folks take years of training to work up into the positions that they\u2019re in and now just turning to students and saying this is essential work that is available doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, the Jamaican fruit picker is dreading harvest season without more support to ease the workload. He earns around $900 every two weeks and works six days per week, sending his pay home to support six family members.\u201cWhen its reaping time in September, I\u2019m worried,\u201d he said. Fewer workers means more pressure and longer hours to bring in the harvest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like this to happen again.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Derek Decloet", "title": "Air Canada, WestJet downgraded by S&P on extended cash burn", "description": "Air Canada won't see revenue and capacity return to last year's levels until 2023, S&P said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/air-canada-and-westjet-downgraded-by-sp-on-extended-cash-burn", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/air-canada-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 20, 2020 3:41 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s largest airlines will burn through cash as they endure a long recovery for the industry, S&P Global Ratings said as it downgraded Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd.Air Canada won\u2019t see revenue and capacity return to last year\u2019s levels until 2023, S&P said in an analysis that led to a one-notch downgrade to BB-.

Aside from locking in repeat customers by helping them accumulate trips, airlines sell miles to credit-card companies, banks, hotels and other businesses for billions of dollars. This revenue source is crucial now that the pandemic has thrown aviation into crisis, and airlines are piling in with new offers such as bonus points and lowering thresholds to qualify for more perks.Some are also increasing the number of points members earn from shopping, as well as expanding partnerships so there are more opportunities to rack up miles. That means it should take less effort to secure reward flights or upgrade to business class. Delta Air Lines Inc. is providing four times the usual amount of miles for purchases with American Express cards at U.S. supermarkets, while Etihad Airways PJSC is offering up to US$400 and 5,000 miles for passengers who postpone flights scheduled before July 31 and has points deals for online shopping and cash-back offers with brands including KFC and Pizza Hut.\u201cThese programs appeal to a carrier\u2019s very best revenue-producing customers, so there is abundant need to keep these consumers happy,\u201d said Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive who is now president of consultancy IdeaWorksCompany. \u201cIn the near term, consumers will see a windfall of cheap travel for redeeming points or miles.\u201dAccording to a 2017 study by Stifel Financial Corp., airlines can get up to 2.5 cents for every mile, so they are a rich source of liquidity. Banks then benefit from annual charges on credit cards and merchant fees when cards are used.JetBlue Airways Corp. this month sold loyalty points to Barclays Plc for US$150 million. The airline received US$475 million from such deals in 2019, according to Stifel analyst Joe DeNardi.

Bloomberg News reported in April that the Treasury Department was in talks with some carriers about accepting loyalty programs as collateral as they rushed to raise funds.Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., which flew just 458 passengers a day in April, is extending Marco Polo memberships and unused mid-tier benefits \u2014 access to business-class lounges, for example \u2014 by 12 months. United Airlines Holdings Inc. has extended Premier memberships through 2022 and made it easier to qualify for reward flights and earn points. Emirates Airline is letting elite Skywards members maintain their statuses by fulfilling just 70 per cent of their tier travel requirements, as well as giving 20 per cent bonus tier miles. This comes as the world\u2019s biggest long-haul carrier considers thousands of job cuts.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for consumers and for the airlines,\u201d said Steve Saxon, a Shanghai-based partner at McKinsey & Co. \u201cBeing able to earn miles for everyday spending makes flight redemptions much more accessible\u201d and carriers can get revenue for seats that might otherwise go empty, he said.Emirates\u2019 members account for almost 45 per cent of the carrier\u2019s commercial revenue, according to Nejib Ben Khedher, divisional senior vice president of Emirates Skywards. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad says loyalty programs help it \u201cobtain valuable data on each guest which allows us to tailor their experience,\u201d while Singapore Airlines Ltd. does \u201cnot take their loyalty for granted.\u201d Singapore Airlines last week reported a record loss. Qatar Airways is offering a so-called status-match with some airlines, and planning new banking and hotel partners.Cheap offers will extend until the end of 2020 for domestic routes and through next spring for longer-haul international routes, Sorensen said. Some airlines may cut down non-travel awards to save cash, or offer discounted business-class seats to loyalty members as companies reduce premium travel, he said.\u201cLoyalty programs will play an essential role in the industry\u2019s recovery by creating incentives for customers to restart travelling,\u201d said Renato Ramos, director for loyalty at Star Alliance, a grouping of airlines that includes the likes of Air China Ltd., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and United. \u201cIn addition to the existing perks for frequent fliers, we are looking at ways to find new benefits.\u201dOne risk is there\u2019s little value left in miles or co-branded credit cards if the issuing airline collapses, which is a very real threat as the likes of Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., Avianca Holdings SA and others show.\u201cThe airline industry itself, among them the legacy airlines, will be transformed after this earthquake-like shock,\u201d said Pankaj Pandit, an independent consultant based in the Indian city of Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. \u201cMany legacy airlines may simply vanish, so naturally their appendage, the loyalty programs, will also wither away,\u201d he said in an email.Some are trying to incentivize members to spend on associated credit cards and transfer points in from other partners such as hotels, according to Gary Leff, co-founder of InsideFlyer.com who writes on loyalty programs.\u201cThere will be empty seats to fill and airlines will need to rely on their programs to make generous offers in order to bring back consumers,\u201d Leff said. \u201cExpect loyalty programs to run aggressive promotions, travel businesses to spend heavily marketing to their frequent fliers and frequent stay guests. In addition, with all of this excess inventory it\u2019ll be easier for consumers to use their points. This will last as long as the downturn lasts.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Shelly Hagan", "title": "Inflation falls below zero in Canada for first time since 2009", "description": "Weak demand should keep inflation at extremely low levels for an extended period, and could even spur worries about deflation", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/inflation-falls-below-zero-in-canada-for-first-time-since-2009?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/inflation.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 20, 2020 10:16 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian inflation went negative for the first time since the 2009 recession after the coronavirus lockdown put the brakes on the world economy.Consumer prices dropped 0.2 per cent in April from the same month a year earlier, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday from Ottawa.

All existing inventory will continue to be sold through retailers until supplies run out, she said.J&J has faced lawsuits accusing it of hiding the cancer risks tied its talc-based version of baby powder since 2014. Juries across the U.S. have hit the company with billions of dollars in actual and punishment damages over their handling of the product. J&J has been successful in getting many of those verdicts reduced or wiped out on appeal.J&J\u2019s cornstarch-based baby powder, which has been on the market since 1980, will continue to be sold in the U.S. and Canada. Widmer said 75 per cent of its U.S. baby-powder customers use the cornstach product, while 25 per cent rely on the talc-based product. Outside the U.S. those numbers are reversed, Widmer said, and the talc-based product will continue to be distributed abroad.Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of the company\u2019s U.S. consumer-health revenue. It has seen a decline in sales over the past few years as consumer habits have changed, Widmer said. The company blames \u201cmisinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising\u201d for the drop in demand, according to a statement.Talcum powder has long been a mainstay of baby products because the mineral keeps skin dry and prevents diaper rash. Talc mines, however, can also yield asbestos, a mineral once used in products such as building insulation. Some companies have found corn starch can offer the same benefits of talc without the asbestos risk.Yanking its talc-based baby powder off the market could limit the number of cancer lawsuits the 127-year-old product generates each year. J&J officials said last month they\u2019d had a 15 per cent increase in the number of suits alleging baby powder causes different kinds of cancer.Still, J&J \u201cremains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the company in the courtroom.\u201dThe statement noted that all verdicts against it have been overturned through the appeals process.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Claire Ballentine and Vildana Hajric", "title": "U.S. stocks close in the red for first time in four sessions after vaccine study questioned", "description": "Headwinds remain for stocks, not least a deteriorating U.S.-China relationship", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-decline-with-u-s-futures-treasuries-climb-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fearless.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 19, 2020 4:31 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks fell for the first time in four sessions after reports circulated that Moderna Inc.\u2019s vaccine study, which was credited in part for Monday\u2019s rally, didn\u2019t produce enough critical data to assess its success.

Now, he\u2019s bailing out just as the pandemic throws the U.S. economy onto uncertain terrain.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold 84 per cent of its Goldman Sachs stock in the first quarter, marking a reversal for an investor who generally holds large stakes in the banking sector. It was one of the most notable changes in Berkshire\u2019s more-than US$180-billion portfolio in the period, as the bank underperforms the broader U.S. market.Buffett traces his relationship with Goldman Sachs back to a meeting with the bank\u2019s longtime head, Sidney Weinberg, in 1940. The billionaire investor routinely praised former Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein as he led the Wall Street firm through the last financial crisis. Then Berkshire started paring its stake during the last few months of 2019 \u2014 after David Solomon had succeeded Blankfein as CEO \u2014 and deepened that cut in the first quarter, nearly bringing the investment to an end.\u201cHe has this historical relationship with Goldman, so maybe there\u2019s some sentimental value,\u201d said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business. \u201cBut of course, Buffett\u2019s primary concern is efficient allocation of capital.\u201dBuffett\u2019s set-up is different this time around. During the 2008 crisis, Goldman Sachs tapped Berkshire to invest in preferred stock, offering a 10 per cent annual dividend and warrants. Buffett said in 2009 that, while he had a good relationship with the bank, it was primarily the terms that attracted him.Those preferred shares are long gone. Berkshire now holds only common stock in the lender, a stake that dwindled to 1.92 million shares at the end of the first quarter, from a high of more than 18 million shares. It\u2019s not known if or how the stake may have changed since then.Buffett\u2019s retreat followed Solomon\u2019s rise to the top job in October 2018. An investment banker by trade, Solomon has been pushing the firm deeper into less-familiar terrain with transaction banking and deposit gathering, making it look more like its rivals. Buffett has rarely discussed Solomon in public.Solomon\u2019s style may clash with that of the famously frugal CEO of Berkshire. The bank ordered a pair of Gulfstream private jets late in 2019 to ferry executives around the globe, after years of using Berkshire\u2019s own NetJets business.Berkshire didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Buffett\u2019s dealings with investment banks in general may make him more cautious toward the sector. He had a tumultuous ride with a bet on Salomon Inc., where he had to step in as interim chairman in 1991 and appear before Congress after the company admitted to violating Treasury auction rules. Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, put it more succinctly around four years ago: The pair tends to fear investment-banking business more than they love it.\u201cHe\u2019s always been a little skittish about investing in investment banks after getting somewhat burned in the Salomon experience,\u201d Kass said.Still, Buffett has been willing to praise investment bankers he admires. He frequently turned to Byron Trott, a former Goldman Sachs banker who later founded BDT Capital Partners, for acquisitions, noting that Trott \u201cearns his fee.\u201dBuffett, 89, has been bullish on the banking sector. He\u2019s the largest investor in Bank of America Corp. and has praised its CEO, Brian Moynihan. Berkshire has continued to be the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo & Co. as it worked through the fallout from a sales scandal. And while Berkshire trimmed its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the first quarter, it boosted a holding of PNC Financial Services Group Inc.Berkshire and Goldman Sachs are gearing up for the worst economic landscape in recent years. Buffett signalled caution at his annual meeting earlier in May, saying that his record cash pile of US$137 billion wasn\u2019t that huge when he looked at worst-case possibilities. He even dumped Berkshire\u2019s stakes in four major U.S. airlines.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs suffered an almost US$900-million hit on its investment portfolio in the first quarter, normally a lucrative business in better economic conditions.\u201cHistorically, the banks have been a bellwether for the good and the ill of external events, because ultimately it\u2019s kind of the choke point for the financial system,\u201d Blankfein said Monday in a Bloomberg TV interview.Investors, at least \u201csince the financial crisis have had an arched eyebrow when approaching investments in banks,\u201d Blankfein said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "John Gittelsohn and Jack Sidders", "title": "Loaded with cash, real estate investors wait for sellers to crack", "description": "Sellers are currently willing to concede discounts of around 5 per cent, while bidders are hoping for about 20 per cent off pre-pandemic prices", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/loaded-with-cash-real-estate-buyers-wait-for-sellers-to-crack?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 19, 2020 11:50 AM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s biggest real estate investors are sitting on piles of cash, preparing for once-in-a-lifetime opportunities created by the pandemic.With economies around the world sputtering, commercial real estate prices are expected to come down.

That estimated gap, which is likely wider in specific cases, has put a freeze on deals.\u201cThe mantra for anything that hasn\u2019t gotten started is: delay, defer and, in many cases, renegotiate,\u201d Hewlett said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to have vintage May 2020 on my books, I want to be able to demonstrate to my investors that I got an exceptionally good deal.\u201dPrivate equity firms across the globe hold an estimated US$328 billion in dry powder for real estate deployment, according to the data firm Preqin Ltd. Prior to the crisis, asset prices had been pushed up as investors chased yield in riskier corners of the property market. Now, Blackstone Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Inc., the largest real estate investing companies, are expected to hunt for bargains among the fallout from the pandemic.For now, social distancing rules and a virtual travel halt have stalled transactions and led to speculation that prices will drop in coming months.\u201cThe physical restrictions taking place are mostly preventing new deals from happening,\u201d Tom Leahy, a London-based senior director at Real Capital Analytics Inc. said. \u201cFar fewer active buyers, far fewer deals, an increase of deals falling out of contract \u2014 those are the preludes to seeing prices fall when the market does come back.\u201dFar fewer active buyers, far fewer deals, an increase of deals falling out of contract \u2014 those are the preludes to seeing prices fall when the market does come backThe volume of deals in Europe plunged 65 per cent in April from a year earlier, according to Leahy. U.S. and Asian markets faced similar drops.Asia, where the pandemic began, is likely to recover faster than Europe or America, as Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and parts of China reopen for business, according to Richard Barkham, chief economist for CBRE Group Inc. Transactions in the Americas will fall an estimated 35 per cent this year, compared with a roughly 25 per cent decline in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.Still, New York-based Blackstone, which had US$538 billion in assets under management at the end of March, is \u201cstarting to see some rescue situations,\u201d President Jonathan Gray said during an earnings call last month. He added that \u201cdistress takes time to play out.\u201dBrookfield, meanwhile, has US$60 billion \u201cready to be deployed globally as opportunities arise,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt said last week.\u201cIn reflecting on what really matters to our business, it is liquidity, liquidity and liquidity, in that order,\u201d he wrote in a letter to shareholders.The firms with money to spend first have to figure out what do do with some of their more vulnerable recent investments. Blackstone said last month that its real estate portfolio, which represents about 30 per cent of its assets under management, is concentrated in \u201csectors that have shown greater resilience to COVID-related headwinds.\u201dStill, not all its bets look like winners. In late February, Blackstone announced a deal to buy a US$6-billion portfolio of university dormitories in the U.K. popular with international students.\u201cAre they scratching their heads about having put money into the student business?\u201d Chris Grigg, CEO of British Land Co., one of the U.K.\u2019s largest commercial landlords, said. \u201cYou\u2019d guess they probably are a bit.\u201dBlackstone said in a statement that U.K. student housing will benefit from \u201cincredible long-term demand trends that are not going away.\u201dBrookfield made waves with a US$15-billion bet on malls in 2018. But with retail stores shuttered and more consumers shopping online, the company recently announced a US$5-billion retail revitalization program.Until shopping, commuting and travel become routine again, it will be hard for investors to agree on what malls, hotels, offices and other properties are worth.\u201cProof is really going to be when the markets start to reopen when buyers and sellers find a middle ground with what\u2019s going to happen with pricing,\u201d Real Capital\u2019s Leahy said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be asymmetrical.

That\u2019s the fastest pace of growth in almost two decades. Profit in the quarter also beat expectations.Walmart comparable-store sales in Canada were up 8.5 per cent.Walmart\u2019s results reinforce how North Americans\u2019 spending priorities rapidly shifted to staples and away from discretionary items with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, before pivoting back to items like office equipment, sporting goods and toys as the quarter wore on. The report for the three-month period ended April 30 sparked stock advances from peers such as Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp.Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said the quarter was a roller-coaster ride that started strong in February before a flurry of stockpiling in mid-March. Growth slowed in early April but then re-accelerated after government stimulus checks arrived.\u201cIt really was unprecedented,\u201d Biggs said in an interview. \u201cIt was several quarters within a quarter.\u201dThe shares rose as much as 3.4 per cent to US$131.99 on Tuesday. The stock had gained 7.4 per cent this year before Tuesday, compared to a drop of 8.6 per cent for the S&P 500 Index.Walmart\u2019s move to build up its e-commerce capacity paid off, with online sales in the U.S. rising 74 per cent in the quarter. That outpaces the average analyst estimate of 51 per cent. To counter rival Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s popular Prime service, the company is rolling out a subscription-based grocery delivery offering and recently introduced a two-hour home delivery service in some markets.The online pickup and delivery business increased fourfold at times during the March peak period, Biggs said, bringing in many new customers. This included older Americans who may not have shopped much online before.Despite the dramatic sales growth, there\u2019s concern that higher sales of everyday items like food and toilet paper, instead of higher-margin discretionary items, will reduce margins. Fulfillment costs also erode the profitability of online orders.Walmart said gross profit margins narrowed due to a shift to lower-margin categories and web sales along with markdowns and other investments to lower prices. But the e-commerce business still lost less money than it did in the year-ago quarter.\u201cThe results were clearly positive, particularly on the profitability side,\u201d John Tomlinson, an analyst at M Science, said by phone. \u201cThere were not too many holes to pick in the quarter.

Druckenmiller on Tuesday called a V-shaped recovery \u2014 the idea the economy will quickly snap back as the coronavirus pandemic eases \u2014 a \u201cfantasy.\u201d Tepper said Wednesday that next to 1999, equities are overvalued the most he\u2019s ever seen.It\u2019s a notion catching on among Wall Street money managers. And it\u2019s coming as investors start to suspect that the Federal Reserve\u2019s support, as well as US$3 trillion in Treasury stimulus, may not be enough to compensate for soaring unemployment, a wave of bankruptcies and no end in sight to the pandemic. Managers including Bill Miller, Paul Singer and Paul Tudor Jones have all voiced doubts about markets or the economy.Such bearishness starkly contrasts with the optimism that pushed the S&P 500 Index up 26 per cent from its March low. And the warnings have caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who\u2019s facing re-election and has seen his plans to run on a booming economy shredded by the virus. Trump attacked \u201cso-called \u2018rich guys\u2019\u201d in a tweet Wednesday.\u201cYou must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down,\u201d Trump wrote about the stock market. \u201cThen they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways.\u201dWhen the so-called \u201crich guys\u201d speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?His criticism is unlikely to sway Wall Street professionals. The S&P 500 Index is down 3.8 per cent this week, and investors and economists are forecasting further declines amid a prolonged struggle to right the economy.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Trump\u2019s pick for the job, outlined a doom-laden scenario with mass bankruptcies and unemployment in a speech delivered around the same time as the president\u2019s tweet. Powell said policymakers may have to do more to prevent long-term damage to the economy.Tepper\u2019s comments were a change from late March, when he said he was \u201cnibbling\u201d at stocks, buying into companies focused on technology or hospitals and health care. Tepper, who runs the US$13-billion Appaloosa hedge fund, told CNBC on Wednesday that valuations are \u201cnuts\u201d for some individual stocks on the Nasdaq. He also highlighted banks and airlines as difficult areas in which to invest right now.Druckenmiller said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York that his analysis showed liquidity that drove markets higher will soon shrink as Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases. The 66-year-old said he\u2019s never seen a time when the risk of owning stocks so outweighed the potential gain.When reached by phone on Wednesday, billionaire Leon Cooperman pointed to an email he wrote in late April that predicted the government\u2019s actions to combat the pandemic will lead to higher taxes and more regulation. He estimated the S&P 500 should be trading lower \u2014 somewhere between 2,200 to 2,800 \u2014 which suggests stocks could fall as much as 22 per cent.\u201cI\u2019m 77 years old and I\u2019ve never seen this level of uncertainty,\u201d Cooperman said in the phone interview. \u201cThis cycle is different than the other seven bear market cycles I lived through because this is the only one where we had a broad scale shut down of the economy, which I view as a mistake.\u201dI'm 77 years old and I've never seen this level of uncertaintyCooperman warned that the longer the economy remains shut, the greater the risk of a depression.Other marquee investors also have taken more defensive stances recently. Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corp., told clients in early May he was investing in gold and had even put a small percentage of his firm\u2019s assets in Bitcoin as he looked for havens. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn said in late April that he wasn\u2019t buying stocks. Instead, he was hoarding cash and shorting commercial real estate.Stock-picker Miller said in an email he\u2019s changed his mind about the market\u2019s prospects for the near future.\u201cThe buying opportunity I talked about on CNBC on March 18 did not last as long as I thought it would,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAfter being up about 30 per cent from the low on March 23, I would think a pause and some consolidation is in order.\u201d He predicted the S&P 500 could fall 4 per cent or 5 per cent from its current level.A few of the more bearish hedge fund managers already sounded the alarm earlier this year. Crispin Odey told clients in a March update that \u201cnothing is immune from the slowdown.\u201d\u201cBy all means buy your favourite shares, I am not going to put you off,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut know that from here on you are now on the wrong side of history.\u201dSinger, the founder of Elliott Management, who on Feb. 1 told his staff to prepare for quarantines, told clients in mid-April \u2014 while stocks were soaring \u2014 that the outlook for equities was dire. Global stock markets could fall 50 per cent or more from their February top, he said.It\u2019s not just fund managers. Billionaire Mark Cuban, who is part of a group chosen by Trump last month to help advise on reopening the economy, said he agreed with Druckenmiller about equities.\u201cStocks are overvalued and the risk-reward isn\u2019t there till we see a cohesive plan for testing from the government,\u201d Cuban said in an email.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe", "title": "'A disappointing missed opportunity': Trudeau's central bank choice hits a nerve among women in finance", "description": "They're questioning how the prime minister's avowedly feminist government could have passed over Carolyn Wilkins for Bank of Canada governor", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeaus-central-bank-choice-hits-nerve-among-women-in-finance?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/wilkins-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 14, 2020 12:37 PM EDT", "content": "When Justin Trudeau unveiled his first cabinet with equal numbers of men and women, he explained the move with three words that are now famous: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201dNow it\u2019s 2020, and some women working in the trenches of Canadian finance are wondering if the push for equality doesn\u2019t apply to them. They\u2019re questioning, privately and publicly, how the prime minister\u2019s avowedly feminist government could have passed over Carolyn Wilkins for Bank of Canada governor.Wilkins, the central bank\u2019s second-in-command, was the most qualified woman ever to compete for the position. The government\u2019s decision to name Tiff Macklem was a disappointment to those who say it underscores slow progress in advancing women to executive roles in economics and finance. Canada may have a reputation as a progressive country, but no woman has ever been finance minister, central bank governor, chief executive of one of its six biggest banks, or head of a large public pension fund.\u201cBased on the feedback I\u2019ve had, this has been a very big blow to women in financial services and the overarching question is, \u2018What else do we possibly need to do?\u2019\u201d said Tanya Van Biesen, executive director of Catalyst Canada, a group that advocates for women\u2019s leadership in the workplace. \u201cWhen is it clear the system is broken? The women are not broken.\u201dWhen is it clear the system is broken? The women are not brokenBloomberg interviewed eight Canadian women in senior roles in finance and economics. Most spoke on condition they not be identified, as their employers didn\u2019t want them expressing public views about the politically sensitive appointment of the central bank governor.All were careful to point out they respect Macklem, who takes up the Bank of Canada\u2019s top job on June 3. But several said when it comes to getting the top jobs in finance, an old-boys\u2019 network still exists.\u201cNot to take anything away from Tiff,\u201d said Margaret Franklin, chief executive officer of the Charlottesville, Virginia-based CFA Institute and former president of BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Canada. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disappointing missed opportunity, particularly for a government that\u2019s been very clear on the agenda of putting very well-qualified, very credible women in leadership positions.\u201dSome say the decision highlights a lack of transparency in the process. The Bank of Canada governor is selected entirely in secret and there is no confirmation hearing, unlike the chair of the Federal Reserve. The world finds out who got the job when the finance minister and the new governor walk into an introductory news conference.That Wilkins and Macklem were both qualified for the role was evident. They were the only people on the final shortlist. Wilkins had backers within Trudeau\u2019s office but Finance Minister Bill Morneau championed Macklem, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Wilkins had the support of the current governor, Stephen Poloz, who had been grooming his top deputy for years.An official in the prime minister\u2019s office, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity, said the government had several conversations and took time to make the right decision, describing the candidates as excellent. The official said there was no division within the government about Macklem as the consensus choice.Macklem, 58, spent two decades at the bank, helping to lead Canada through the 2008-09 financial crisis in the No. 2 role she now holds. Wilkins, 56, has been at the bank almost as long, becoming senior deputy governor in 2014. She\u2019s the bank\u2019s Group of 20 and Group of Seven deputy and has represented it at global institutions including the International Monetary Fund.Wilkins has also been front and centrein the bank\u2019s efforts to loosen up credit markets and buffer the country\u2019s economy from the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest shock since the Great Depression.She doesn\u2019t have a Ph.D. in economics like Macklem, Poloz or Mark Carney, who was governor from 2008 to 2013. On the other hand, neither do Fed Chairman Jerome Powell or European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.Macklem does have one other thing Wilkins doesn\u2019t: senior management experience outside the bank. Given the government hasn\u2019t chosen an insider as governor since 1994 \u2014 including Macklem, who was passed over in 2013 for Poloz \u2014 that may have mattered.Macklem is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. He also also ran an expert government panel on sustainable finance and was a director of the Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada\u2019s third-largest bank, where he was chairman of the risk committee.Requiring outside experience is another way of disqualifying women, several of the women interviewed said. There are few in the upper echelons of Canada\u2019s financial industry to choose from. There are even fewer with experience in both monetary policy and finance. If outside experience is a must-have, that should be made clear in the selection process, said one woman who works in a senior role at a large Canadian bank.Canada\u2019s financial industry does better than many sectors in advancing women, particularly at the biggest firms, but the rate of improvement has been slow, according to law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, LLP, which does an annual study. Last year, an average of 21 per cent of executive officers were women, up from 19 per cent in 2016, the law firm said.Wilkins \u201chas done the hard work, put in the hard yard, proven herself, and yet this job was still not available to her,\u201d Van Biesen said.The senior deputy governor declined an interview request on the topic. \u201cI have deep respect for Tiff as an economist, and as a public servant. I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as governor and as a colleague on the governing council as we carry out the important work of the Bank,\u201d Wilkins said in an email.Some of the those interviewed see the personal relationship between Morneau and Macklem as central to the decision. The finance minister had been considering Macklem for the job for two years, according to a person familiar with the minister\u2019s thinking.Macklem was part of the \u201cin crowd\u201d of Canadian finance, said one woman with a long history on Bay Street. In 2018, Morneau appointed Macklem to chair an expert panel on sustainable finance, which laid out ways markets can push the transition to a green economy, a priority for the Trudeau government.Armine Yalnizyan, a Canadian economist and research fellow at the progressive Atkinson Foundation, speculated Wilkins may end up as deputy finance minister to further her credentials. A switch to the powerful finance department, in the midst of a crisis in which fiscal policy will be centre stage, might put Wilkins in an even more influential role than running the Bank of Canada, she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Scott Deveau", "title": "Brookfield is sitting on $60 billion to help it weather the pandemic", "description": "CEO Bruce Flatt says Brookfield is well-positioned to make it through the crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/brookfield-is-sitting-on-60-billion-to-help-weather-pandemic", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/brookfield-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 14, 2020 11:27 AM EDT", "content": "Cash is king in times of crisis, according to Brookfield Asset Management Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer, and the alternative-asset manager has more than US$60 billion to weather the coronavirus pandemic.If a business isn\u2019t prepared for situations like the COVID-19 outbreak that\u2019s rattled markets, it\u2019s often too late once such a crisis hits, Bruce Flatt said in a letter to shareholders Thursday.\u201cIn reflecting on what really matters to our business, it is liquidity, liquidity and liquidity, in that order,\u201d he wrote in the letter. \u201cThe most damaging thing for any business owner is to find yourself out of business and unable to participate in the recovery, or in a position of needing to issue shares which dilute the owners, and therefore make it impossible to ever recover from undue dilution at the wrong time.\u201dBrookfield is well-positioned to make it through the pandemic, with US$46 billion in client commitments for new investments and US$15 billion in cash, other financial assets and long-dated credit facilities across its various businesses that remain largely undrawn, Flatt said.\u201cWe will continue to add to our liquidity and deploy capital as opportunities arise,\u201d he said.During the first quarter, Brookfield shifted its strategy to investing in public companies that were trading at a fraction of what it cost to acquire assets directly from the companies. The company invested roughly US$2 billion in public equity markets, including repurchasing its own shares and those of its publicly traded subsidiaries, Flatt said.\u201cWe have also built up toehold positions in the shares of several companies that we feel, like ours, are being significantly undervalued in the current market environment,\u201d he said.Also on Thursday, Brookfield reported a first-quarter net loss of US$157 million, or 20 US cents a share, compared with earnings of US$1.26 billion, or 39 US cents, a year earlier. Funds from operations, a measure of cash flow, fell to US$884 million, or 55 US cents a share, from US$1.05 billion, or 69 US cents, a year earlier.The company also said it plans to nominate former Royal Bank of Canada Chief Financial Officer Janice Fukakusa to its board at this year\u2019s annual general meeting.The coronavirus has had an impact on Brookfield\u2019s various businesses, Flatt said, but they remain in \u201cgood shape,\u201d with its Oaktree business continuing to find opportunities in distressed debt. Brookfield\u2019s retail real estate business will be stronger than in the past over the medium term, benefiting from premier locations and consolidation in the retail environment, he said.

A similar wave of outbreaks at meat plants in the U.S. has already withered available supplies at grocery stores and driven up retail prices for beef and pork.\u201cWe have plenty of food that will continue to reach grocery stores on a regular basis. But it is clear that COVID-19 is causing significant disruptions in our food supply chains,\u201d Bibeau said by email. \u201cAs a result, Canadians could see less variety in grocery stores or a fluctuation in food prices.\u201dCanadians could see less variety in grocery stores or a fluctuation in food pricesAn outbreak at Cargill Inc.\u2019s beef plant in High River, Alberta sickened nearly half of the facility\u2019s 2,000 workers. Virus outbreaks at JBS SA\u2019s plant in Brooks, Alberta have also prompted slowdowns and the supply squeeze is already forcing companies such as McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s Canadian unit to import beef to supplement their needs.The two Alberta plants account for roughly 85 per cent of Canada\u2019s beef slaughter capacity. \u201cWe will continue to use imported beef until there is a continuous and consistent supply of Canadian raw material,\u201d McDonald\u2019s Canada said Wednesday in an email.In Canada, there\u2019s also a huge dependency on temporary foreign workers to plant, tend and harvest fruit and vegetable crops.

But companies are also considering how best to redesign their operations to prevent infections, including by automating some lines altogether. The likely result: higher costs for an industry dominated by the likes of Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS SA that\u2019s been very efficient at pumping out cheap meat.The changes are arriving as concerns mount over mega-plants staffed with low-paid workers operating elbow-to-elbow. More than 10,000 meat workers have been infected by the coronavirus, and at least 30 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\u201cAmericans want to buy cheaper and cheaper and cheaper food,\u201d said Matthew Wadiak, founder of Cooks Venture, a small chicken producer selling directly to consumers. \u201cWe need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what\u2019s the cost of a human life? It\u2019s a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout.\u201dWorkers at meatpacking plants continue to fall ill, even with barriers placed between them, more protective equipment and enhanced social-distancing measures in common areas including cafeterias and locker rooms.While President Donald Trump has ordered plants to reopen, many are running at slower-than-usual rates to try to reduce the spread. Reducing plants to a third of their capacity and distributing the adequate protective equipment could boost chicken prices at grocery stores by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Sanchoy Das, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what's the cost of a human life? It's a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout\u201cThe 99-cents per pound chicken could be in short supply very quickly,\u201d said Das, whose research focuses primarily on supply chain modelling and analysis.Tyson\u2019s operating costs are sharply higher due to the novel coronavirus and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Chief Executive Officer Noel White and Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said at the BMO Farm to Market virtual conference on Wednesday. That includes US$120 million in bonus for employees, personal protection equipment as well as factory shutdowns and slowdowns.The bulk of America\u2019s beef and pork are processed in a few dozen giant plants that handle thousands of animals in lines that have been allowed to run faster and faster. Tyson, JBS and Cargill Inc. control about two-thirds of America\u2019s beef. Pork and chicken production is similarly concentrated.The outbreak could also help accelerate automation plans companies have already in the works. Tyson has said it is investing \u201caggressively\u201d in automating the most difficult tasks within its plants. The company is installing robots in the deboning areas of its poultry plants, and also has initiatives in beef and pork.\u201cYou are going to see a bifurcation where the larger, more profitable facilities are going to move toward a vastly more automated meat processing facility,\u201d said Decker Walker, an agribusiness expert at Boston Consulting Group. \u201cIncentives for automation have never been higher.\u201dIncentives for automation have never been higherPilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. was increasing its use of automation and robotics even before the pandemic. The company invested more than US$30 million in automation last year, projects that are helping plants to run efficiently in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.\u201cWe believe in automation, we believe in robotics, and we\u2019re going to continue to move down that path,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jayson Penn said in an April 30 call with analysts.Meat processing is usually a low-margin business, meaning companies will be wary of overspending. While there\u2019s probably going to be a lot of change in the way packers do business, consumers will pay for it in the long run, said Steve Meyer, an economist at consultancy Kerns & Associates.\u201cThis whole system was designed to produce quality products at the most reasonable cost possible, so you don\u2019t go and add a lot of extra cost to go handle a once-in-a-100-year situation,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut you also don\u2019t turn a blind eye to the fact that people are sick and some people died. So I think there will be some changes made.\u201dAnother way to reduce infections, especially in poultry plants, would be to produce more whole chickens, as cutting up birds into legs and thighs requires more labor, said Das of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.Consumers in the U.S. can afford to pay a bit more for their meat, said Wadiak of Cooks Venture. That would increase wages and help avoid shared living accommodation, which has been a challenge for meat plant workers looking to adhere to social-distancing practices.\u201cWhen the budget is tight, it\u2019s hard to put food on the table, it\u2019s hard to feed your family, I really, really get that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if that means you are putting food on your table at the cost of someone else\u2019s life, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove", "title": "Under fire from investors, Teck's CEO says the miner has survived downturns before", "description": "Don Lindsay said he thinks Teck's dual-class structure, criticized by investors, will stay in place 'for the foreseeable future'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/teck-resources-ceo-says-hes-survived-collapsing-shares-before", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/don-lindsay-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 13, 2020 9:43 AM EDT", "content": "Under fire from investors who have called for his ouster, the chief executive of Teck Resources Ltd. said the miner has weathered downturns before.On Monday, Impala Asset Management LLC revealed it sent a letter to Teck\u2019s board in February, criticizing CEO Don Lindsay for decisions it says have hurt the share price and saying he is overpaid. Earlier this month, an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, also called for Lindsay\u2019s replacement and said the company should divest its energy and coal businesses.Both investors are critical of Teck\u2019s dual-class share structure, which allows the Keevil family \u2014 which has been involved with the firm for more than six decades \u2014 to control the company.Most of Teck\u2019s A-shares are held by Temagami Mining Co., which is owned by the Keevil family and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Speaking at a Bank of America conference on Tuesday, Lindsay said that only Temagami has the power to dismantle the dual-class structure, which he believes will stay in place \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201dThus far, Lindsay has refrained from commenting directly on the shareholder activism, although the company has issued statements saying he has widespread shareholder support. The miner also says the stock\u2019s decline \u2014 59 per cent in the past year in Toronto \u2014 is mostly due to falling commodity prices.Lindsay reiterated that point at the virtual conference and also defended his strategy for the company.\u201cWe know that investors tend to be cautious during these phases,\u201d he said, referring to Teck\u2019s \u201cinvestment cycle\u201d in which it\u2019s ramping up its copper business and trying to boost its steelmaking-coal margins. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen something very similar before during financing and construction of another high-altitude copper mine \u2014 Antamina \u2014 which also coincided with a significant downturn in the market.\u201dLindsay was referring to construction of the Antamina mine in Peru which was completed in 2001, spokesman Chris Stannell said in an email following the speech.Throughout that period, Teck\u2019s share price was in the \u201cpenalty box,\u201d Lindsay reminded analysts. \u201cBut our then-CEO and now chairman emeritus Dr. Keevil, he had the vision and the tenacity to see it through.\u201dSince then, Teck has weathered other commodity downturns. In 2015, the company was stripped of its investment grade rating amid the collapse of the commodities supercycle.\u201cBy contrast with the last downcycle which ended in 2016 we are in a much stronger position with a reduced debt profile; strong liquidity; and secured QB2 funding,\u201d Lindsay said Tuesday, referring to the Quebrada Blanca expansion project in Chile.Bob Bishop, the CEO of Impala, said he began buying Teck shares in December 2015 with most of the fund\u2019s position purchased in January 2016, the only saving grace for the investment.\u201cIf you are smart enough to buy Teck once every seven years when people think Teck may go broke, then you can make a great return because the commodity markets usually bail them out,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cI was that buyer in 2016.\u201dTeck began that year at $5.34 a share in Toronto and rose to nearly $39 by early 2018.

It far exceeded the maximum loss anticipated by HSBC\u2019s value-at-risk models.HSBC\u2019s loss highlights the extreme nature of the disruption to the gold market in late March, as lockdowns closed refineries and grounded planes, strangling the supply routes that allow physical bullion to move around the globe.The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London, which usually trade within a few dollars an ounce of one another, diverged by as much as US$70 \u2014 the most in four decades. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.HSBC, which had disclosed in a previous filing that it was hit by the gold market disruption, revealed the scale of the loss in a chart this week showing its daily trading profits for the first quarter.The bank described the loss as a \u201cmark-to-market loss mainly associated with gold refining and transportation challenges.\u201d It highlighted the \u201cunprecedented widening of the gold exchange-for-physical basis,\u201d which \u201caffected HSBC\u2019s gold leasing and financing business and other gold hedging activity leading to mark-to-market losses.\u201dHSBC declined to comment.In the past week, the price difference between the New York and London markets has returned to more normal levels of less than US$5 an ounce.Still, HSBC is not the only one struggling with the unusual moves in the gold market.

We\u2019re worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home.\u201dCarrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shook the industry and underscored concern about mental health.\u201cIt\u2019s a very stressful situation,\u201d said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, which represents local unions. \u201cThe prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points.\u201dCarnival Corp.\u2019s Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship\u2019s crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to Covid-19, the company said. Carnival, the world\u2019s largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker\u2019s family.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 line and owner of Celebrity Cruises, said a crew member went overboard from its Jewel of the Seas about two weeks ago.Crew members have said the reported deaths have rattled them and dampened morale, said Krista Thomas, a former Norwegian Cruise Line guest manager who\u2019s operating two Facebook pages for stranded crew and their families. In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.\u201cMany of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they\u2019re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,\u201d said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. \u201cMany have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.\u201dThe cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.\u201cThat one simple question \u2013 how do we get you home? \u2013 turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,\u201d Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. \u201cEach country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions \u2013 and they frequently change without notice.\u201dAbout 15 countries won\u2019t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.The business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.\u201cThis whole experience has been a nightmare,\u201d said Carrick. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of coming back to a ship.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Siddharth Philip", "title": "Michael O\u2019Leary calls UK quarantine \u2018nonsense,\u2019 aims to resume 40% of Ryanair flights by July", "description": "Ryanair saw surge in bookings after announcement, signalling pent-up demand", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/ryanairs-oleary-calls-u-k-quarantine-nonsense-plans-restart?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/michael-oleary.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 12:54 PM EDT", "content": "Ryanair Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O\u2019Leary called the U.K.\u2019s intention to quarantine visitors for 14 days \u201cnonsense,\u201d and said the carrier may resume as many as 70 per cent of its flights by September.The Irish low-cost airline aims to restart with 40 per cent of its normal schedule in July, it said Tuesday.

O\u2019Leary said practical measures to resume travel should be worked out over the next several weeks.\u201cBy the time we get to the first of July, we think masks and temperature checks will become the norm in train stations, on board trains and undergrounds, on buses, in public transport across Europe,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday. \u201cIt would be a reasonably modest extension to add those to airport terminals and on board aircraft.\u201dRyanair gained as much as 3.8 per cent in Dublin trading.

Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.The U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.\u201cWhat it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,\u201d said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. \u201cThe problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.\u201dThe EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a \u201ctourism package\u201d of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers.

In 2019, Lindsay\u2019s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck\u2019s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company\u2019s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen.\u201cAt our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck\u2019s shareholders for the company\u2019s strategy,\u201d Brown said by phone.Impala\u2019s letter alleges four projects \u2014 the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada\u2019s oilsands \u2014 have destroyed over $12 billion in value.\u201cIt\u2019s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,\u201d Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cThe company\u2019s paying top dollar for underperformance.\u201dIt's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsImpala\u2019s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay\u2019s strategy as lacking \u201cclear direction or coherence,\u201d and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada\u2019s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.As for Teck\u2019s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: \u201cWe have been very clear that if we can\u2019t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.\u201dImpala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.\u201cThe dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,\u201d Bishop said. Instead, \u201cit has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.\u201dIn March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck\u2019s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. \u201cThese have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we\u2019re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.\u201dBishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck\u2019s zinc and copper assets. He also said he\u2019s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.\u201cIf they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,\u201d he said.Tribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck\u2019s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.\u201cIf you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shareholding structure is probably in the \u2018undeliverable\u2019 so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth", "title": "Stocks tumble after double whammy of warnings from Fauci and Fed over pandemic economy", "description": "Central bank officials cited risk of the potential for massive bankruptcies that could create a lasting scar", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/european-stocks-gain-while-u-s-futures-edge-lower-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fearless-girl.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 4:33 AM EDT", "content": "Stocks tumbled after a U.S. official warned against a premature reopening of the economy amid a dire outlook from Federal Reserve regional chiefs.

A key measure of U.S. consumer prices declined last month by the most on record. A sustained trend of declining prices would spur worries about deflation, exacerbating concern that the recovery from the deep economic downturn will be very slow.Buyers of U.S. stocks after the economy shrank in the first quarter have history on their side, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth Management.

AMC didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The trade publication Deadline reported Monday morning that \u201cthere are no talks,\u201d citing unidentified sources.AMC shares rose as much as US$2.31 to US$6.41 in New York trading. They were up as little as 19 per cent minutes after the Deadline report and were up 36 per cent to US$5.58 at 11:28 a.m. The stock was down 43 per cent this year through last week, battered along with the rest of the cinema industry by a worldwide shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.AMC\u2019s bonds surged on reports of the talks with Amazon, and were among the top gainers in the U.S. high-yield market on Monday, according to Trace bond-trading data. AMC\u2019s senior subordinated bonds due 2026 were up as much as 10 cents on the dollar to 32 cents, data shows.The reported talks are unlikely to spark a price war for AMC, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst Amine Bensaid said in a note. \u201cMovie-going is unlikely to fully bounce back in a post-COVID-19 world and may create risks for an acquirer,\u201d he said. \u201cAMC\u2019s elevated debt load and unavoidable fixed costs mean the company\u2019s near-term financial flexibility will be severely challenged.\u201dAMC showed its concern about existential threats with its reaction to last month\u2019s straight-to-streaming release of the kids movie \u201cTrolls World Tour,\u201d which Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Pictures crowed about as a high-grossing success. AMC said it would no longer show Universal\u2019s movies.Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, who spent billions of dollars building one of the world\u2019s biggest cinema operators, controls AMC through his closely held Wanda Group. Wanda acquired AMC in 2012 for US$2.6 billion as part of its expansion into entertainment. It subsequently acquired Nordic, Carmike and Odeon & UCI Cinemas.Along with its vast retail and web-services operations, Amazon is an active player in streaming with its Prime Video platform, along with releasing original films. Like Netflix Inc., Amazon is eager to shore up its burgeoning position in Hollywood as new and old players scrap for content deals. Buying a theatre chain would guarantee another outlet for its movies.Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley FBR, wrote to clients Monday that a cash offer for AMC, which is on track for its fourth straight year of stock declines, wouldn\u2019t appeal to investors. A cash offer would be more likely than a stock deal, given AMC\u2019s depressed stock price, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joanna Ossinger", "title": "Bitcoin had a rough weekend as price slumped back below $10,000", "description": "The cryptocurrency fell 10 per cent on Sunday, its biggest one-day drop since March 12", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/bitcoin-has-rough-weekend-as-price-slumps-back-below-10000", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/bitcoin-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 11, 2020 10:30 AM EDT", "content": "Bitcoin slumped over the weekend after rising back above US$10,000 late last week, casting a cloud over its latest attempted rebound.The largest cryptocurrency fell 10 per cent on Sunday, according to Bitstamp pricing.

As a marching band welcomed visitors to the Shanghai park on Monday, authorities around the world were facing rising pressure to end lockdowns and revive economies slammed by the global outbreak.Disney is struggling to recoup earnings at its theme park and film businesses pummelled by the virus crisis, while China\u2019s government is grappling with the challenges of incrementally reopening the country. Parks, factories and restaurants in cities and countries around the world are reopening under rules to keep customers and workers apart amid the threat of second waves and flare-ups of the virus.To reach the gates of Shanghai Disneyland, guests had to pass through body temperature checks and show that their health status has been confirmed using a smartphone app for tracking infected persons. Masks were mandatory, despite the muggy 23 degree Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) weather.Yao Yao, a 37-year-old kindergarten teacher wearing a Minnie Mouse costume, arrived at 8:30 a.m. and was among people waiting for entry.\u201cSimply walking in the park will make me forget anything unhappy,\u201d said Yao, who has an annual pass.Disney said it is limiting access to the Shanghai park on Monday to a fifth of normal capacity, below the government-mandated 30 per cent, during the initial reopening phase. Tickets for May 11 sold out in minutes, a sign consumers are prepared to spend and mingle in public as China cautiously moves beyond the virus.Simply walking in the park will make me forget anything unhappyNew cases in the country where the pathogen first emerged have dwindled, and China has reported no deaths since April 14, according to the National Health Commission.Visitors to the US$5.5 -billion theme park had relatively short waits for rides. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction, for example, had a maximum of five minutes standing in line mid-morning, according to an app that tracks waits at the park. The longest line for a ride at the time was 20 minutes, according to the app.In the afternoon, some lines started to stretch to 30 minutes, maximum.On a typical spring day under normal conditions, visitors might wait more than one hour for the most popular attractions.The Disney World shop, which sells toys and T-shirts, required use of hand sanitizer to enter, and had few shoppers. Popcorn and chicken wing stands were open, though fewer than on a normal day.Live theatre shows, areas where children would come into close contact, such as water play spots, and parades have been suspended during the initial reopening to avoid raising infection risks.\u201cThe real test will come as those capacity limits are eased and the calendar moves into what is typically the critical peak summer season,\u201d said Ron Merriman, managing director of theme park consultants MR ProFun China. \u201cBut I am very optimistic about the park\u2019s prospects for passing that test.\u201dShanghai Disneyland was the first of the entertainment giant\u2019s parks to close on Jan. 25 as the coronavirus began to spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, 520 miles (840 kilometres) west of the country\u2019s business capital.Disney blamed the pandemic for lopping US$1.4 billion off profit last quarter, largely by forcing it to shut resorts around the world. While Disney is keeping its U.S., Hong Kong and Paris parks closed, the company said last week it would open a limited number of shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs mall outside its resorts in Orlando, Florida, on May 20.Tickets to Shanghai Disneyland during the initial reopening phase are 399 yuan (US$56) for regular days, and 499 yuan for weekends.Disney\u2019s theme parks division contributed about 46 per cent of operating income in the 12 months ended September 2019, more than double the earnings from its studio entertainment business, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dana Hull and Ed Ludlow", "title": "Elon Musk unleashes tweet storm, threatening to pull Tesla out of California over \u2018absurd and medically irrational\u2019 shutdown", "description": "The tech sector's loudest voice advocating for the reopening of the economy, has drawn criticism from peers and cheers from conservative political circles", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/musk-threatens-to-pull-tesla-out-of-california-over-shutdown-0510-bc-musk-threatens-to-pull-tesla-out-of-california-over-shutdown-bloom-386-words-f-05-09-20-0205-pm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/elon-musk-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 11, 2020 8:22 AM EDT", "content": "Elon Musk lashed out at the California county blocking Tesla Inc. from reopening its only U.S. car plant, threatening to immediately move the company\u2019s headquarters and future programs to other states and cease manufacturing at its factory.The chief executive officer said Tesla will file a lawsuit against Alameda County, a day after its health officer said it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the carmaker to move forward with plans to reopen.

Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.The tweets raise pressure on California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Bay area officials who were among the first in the U.S. to implement shelter-in-place orders and have been cautious about lifting them.

The price of West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen more than 60% since the deal was signed.Megadeals Fall DownTwo of the biggest U.S. deals to fall apart hit a wall in late March and early April, just a couple of weeks after the first states went into lockdown.Rivals Woodward Inc. and Hexcel Corp. on April 6 called off a $6.4 billion merger agreement that would have created one of the world\u2019s biggest aerospace and defense suppliers. The companies noted the pandemic\u2019s effect on the aviation industry, which has so far been promised more than $85 billion in government funds after the crisis wiped out travel demand.Xerox Holdings Corp. decided to back off of its $35 billion hostile bid for HP Inc., saying the Covid-19 pandemic made the macroeconomic and market outlook too uncertain.Slow IPOsSoftware maker Procore Technologies Inc., Warner Music Group Corp. and retailer Cole Haan all pushed back plans for IPOs as the pandemic hit, Bloomberg News has reported.At least three companies that got as far as picking dates for their share sales have delayed their listings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.\u201cWe began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,\u201d Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. \u201cWe would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.\u201dBrookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn\u2019t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield\u2019s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia\u2019s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure\u2019s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.\u201cOur outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,\u201d Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a \u2018swoosh\u2019 shape than \u2018U\u2019 or a \u2018V\u2019 with the aid of government stimulus.

Months later, the value of the Quebec-based company plunged amid controversies over business practices, accounting and drug pricing. Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. \u2014 the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. \u2014 crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada\u2019s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck. The telecommunications-equipment maker ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was liquidated.The dramatic collapse of two Canadian tech giants in a country more known for being hewers of wood and drawers of water has hung over the country\u2019s corporate psyche for years. So Shopify\u2019s rise has been cheered on by many.\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,\u201d said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify \u201cshould be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it\u2019s tech sector because it\u2019s been remarkable what they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. Jackson had owned the company\u2019s stock but doesn\u2019t currently have a position. Its U.S.-listed shares have risen by 43 times since the initial public offering at US$17 in 2015.This year\u2019s rally, which has seen the stock double, has drawn its doubters.\u201cOn just about any valuation metric, this is one of the most expensive stocks in Techland,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco told clients in a note Wednesday. Shopify also holds the highest sales multiple, though has the largest sales growth outlook, RBC added. The bank rates Shopify with the equivalent of a buy.The rally has made founder and chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, Canada\u2019s fourth-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 39-year-old has added US$2.8 billion to his wealth this year, and is now worth US$6.3 billion. The billionaire has about 7 per cent of Shopify, according to its 2019 proxy circular.Lutke, a German immigrant with vivid blue eyes and a penchant for tweed caps, began building software to launch an online snowboard store in 2004. It became obvious that the software was more valuable than the snowboards, according to his website profile, and he went on to launch the Shopify platform in 2006. RBC was incorporated in 1869.Shopify sells tools to help companies set up an online store, a business model seen flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic that has shuttered bricks and mortar stores. In April, the company\u2019s chief technology officer tweeted Shopify was handling \u201cBlack Friday-level traffic every day\u201d to bring thousands of businesses online.At Bloomberg\u2019s Sooner Than You Think conference in New York last year, Lutke said Shopify isn\u2019t competing with Amazon.com Inc. but helping other people do so.\u201cThey\u2019ve obviously become the anti-Amazon, they\u2019re all about empowering everybody else except Amazon on the online e-commerce world to be successful and they\u2019ve expanded and expanded their suite of services,\u201d Jackson said.He believes Shopify has the opportunity to keep rising and have a market value of several hundred billion dollars in the years ahead.\u201cThey are still just getting going. People who complain they are \u2018too expensive\u2019 don\u2019t understand how much revenue and profits they\u2019ll drive in the years ahead,\u201d Jackson said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Brookfield launches $5 billion \u2018retail revitalization\u2019 program to prop up retailers hit hard by pandemic", "description": "Brookfield, known for its contrarian bets on malls, will take minority stakes in struggling retailers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/brookfield-plans-5-billion-to-prop-up-retailers-after-mall-bet", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/brookfield.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 7, 2020 4:33 PM EDT", "content": "Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which made a large bet on malls back in 2018, plans to invest US$5 billion to help struggling retailers.The Toronto-based firm has launched a \u201cretail revitalization\u201d program that will focus on taking minority stakes in retail businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic, according to a statement on Thursday.Brookfield is known for its contrarian bets on malls.

While the order book for the marquee Global 7500 is \u201clargely intact,\u201d the manufacturer is cutting spending and deferring discretionary investments to shore up profitability at lower production levels.The weak demand outlook is raising the pressure on new Chief Executive Officer Eric Martel as the company exits its operations in commercial planes and rail equipment. Bombardier burned through US$1.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter, with as much as half of that coming from slow orders for planes and trains, temporary factory shutdowns and the inability to deliver aircraft amid government travel restrictions.Bombardier tumbled 6.6 per cent to 50 cents at 11:51 a.m. in Toronto. The shares fell 73 per cent this year through Wednesday, the fourth-worst drop on Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index.Business activity will hit a low point in the current quarter \u201cbefore gradually recovering in the second half,\u201d Bombardier said.The company\u2019s rail division, which is being sold to France\u2019s Alstom SA, received a first-quarter equity injection of US$386 million from the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, a longtime investor. The sale to Alstom is proceeding well and is still expected to close in the first half of next year, Bombardier executives said on a call with analysts.The sale of the CRJ regional-jet line to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. will close June 1, Bombardier said, echoing a statement by the Japanese company. Bombardier already sold its stake in Airbus SE\u2019s A220 jetliner program to the European planemaker. Bombardier invested more than US$6 billion in developing the A220, which was originally known as the C Series.Bombardier\u2019s adjusted loss widened to 10 US cents a share, worse than the 7-cent average shortfall expected by analysts. Sales climbed 5 per centto US$3.69 billion.Bombardier is in talks with countries where it has operations in case temporary liquidity needs arise, Martel said on the call. His first weeks on the job have been focused on managing costs and cash flow while talking to customers and suppliers to confirm orders and reset delivery schedules.He outlined a set of priorities that include completing asset sales, becoming a more predictable company and aligning production with market demand to generate a steadier cash flow. He also pledged to define a \u201cclear vision\u201d for the company.Martel, who used to head the business jets division before leaving Bombardier for a few years to head Canada\u2019s biggest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, said he hasn\u2019t seen many order cancellations so far. That\u2019s a contrast with December 2014, when cancellations started piling up after oil prices collapsed, he said.\u201cIt is moving at a slow pace, there\u2019s no decision being made,\u201d Martel said, adding that customers have asked for information on plane availability and timing as they assess the duration and impact of the pandemic. \u201cWe think that when we have more visibility on the pandemic that the activity level will be restarting.\u201dDemand for bigger private jets seems more solid than for smaller aircraft, Martel said.The Montreal-based company, which suspended its financial forecast in March, said it would offer updated projections when it has greater visibility on the pandemic\u2019s impact.\u201cWe have limited exposure today on the light jet versus either 2008 or even 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always felt going into those crises that the large-segment market was much more robust.

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.\u201cIt will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men\u2019s jobs affected,\u201d according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers \u2014 where many women work \u2014 is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a \u201cshe-cession,\u201d April\u2019s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Brendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday\u2019s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn\u2019t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. \u201cThe hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,\u201d Bernard said by phone.While Friday\u2019s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it\u2019s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.\u201cThat\u2019s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cThe job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.\u201dThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won\u2019t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.\u201cOnce things start to return to normal, it\u2019s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,\u201d Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.\u201cWe are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,\u201d Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Olga Kharif", "title": "Bitcoin is staging a comeback reminiscent of the 2017 bubble frenzy", "description": "In anticipation for a technical event that may be a new catalyst, Bitcoin has rallied to more than US$9,000 from around US$6,000 just a month ago", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/bitcoin-is-staging-a-comeback-reminiscent-of-2017-bubble-frenzy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/bitcoin.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 2:50 PM EDT", "content": "It\u2019s been left for dead more than once, written off as nothing but a bubble and denounced as rat poison by one of the world\u2019s most famous investors. Yet Bitcoin is once again staging a comeback reminiscent of the token\u2019s glory days, with evangelists pegging their hopes on a technical event as the new catalyst.True believers say the gains are driven by Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving, when the rewards miners receive for processing transactions will be cut in half as soon as May 12. The internet is glutted with second-by-second countdown clocks and the mania is even spurring a hike in hiring by crypto firms worldwide. Bitcoin has rallied to more than US$9,000 in anticipation from around US$6,000 just a month ago.\u201cNarratives in the world of blockchain act like the Force in Star Wars \u2014 they mysteriously move and shape the market,\u201d said George McDonaugh, co-founder of crypto and blockchain investment firm KR1. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be blamed for getting a little excited about what\u2019s to come.\u201dBitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin\u2019s undergone two prior halvings \u2014 or halvenings, as they\u2019re sometimes called \u2014 which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world\u2019s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017\u2019s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days \u2014 should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there\u2019s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin\u2019s halving, he wrote in a recent note.To be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor\u2019s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn\u2019t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.\u201cIt is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,\u201d Pal wrote in a recent presentation. \u201cIt was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.\u201dJefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly \u201cGreed & Fear\u201d newsletter recommended investors \u2014 including institutions \u2014 buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token\u2019s prior price surges around the event.\u201cTo invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,\u201d he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification \u201cprecisely because of its truly decentralized nature,\u201d he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeVenture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. \u201cBitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,\u201d he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels.

Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more \u201cdifficult adjustments\u201d would be put forth in the next two weeks. \u201cDays like this are brutal,\u201d he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a \u201clast wave\u201d in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber\u2019s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees.

HSBC said that the gold market \u201cbecame highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,\u201d contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70.

The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC\u2019s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter.

Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soonAs governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he\u2019s pivoting to \u201cphase two\u201d of the nation\u2019s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.\u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201dOn his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as \u201cwarriors\u201d as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was \u201cthe biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make.\u201dAnd while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.\u201cThere\u2019ll be more death,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we\u2019re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it\u2019s going to pass, and we\u2019re going to be back to normal.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s been a rough process. There is no question about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think our economy is going to be raging\u201d next year, he added.While in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done \u201csafely.\u201dYet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d and Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019s version of \u201cLive and Let Die.\u201dSenior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn\u2019t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that \u201cdoctors\u201d he didn\u2019t name had advised him to close the economy \u201cfor a couple of years.\u201d\u201cI created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. \u201cAnd then one day they said, \u2018we have to close our country.\u2019 Well, now it\u2019s time to open up.\u201dPublic-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a \u201cfire\u201d that could be extinguished \u201cfast.\u201dHe also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriors\u201cThese models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They\u2019ve been so wrong, they\u2019ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on \u201cfaulty assumptions\u201d about mitigation efforts and didn\u2019t represent federal government projections.\u201cThe people of our country are warriors,\u201d Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.\u201cMike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we\u2019re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And we\u2019ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,\u201d Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: \u201cNo.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Enda Curran", "title": "Capitalism as We Know It May Never Be the Same", "description": "Capitalism as We Know It May Never Be the SameBy Enda Curran(Bloomberg) \u2014The pandemic that turned the global economy upside down is also threatening to rewrite the rules of capitalism ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/capitalism-as-we-know-it-may-never-be-the-same", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 6:08 AM EDT", "content": "Capitalism as We Know It May Never Be the SameBy Enda Curran(Bloomberg) \u2014The pandemic that turned the global economy upside down is also threatening to rewrite the rules of capitalism itself.The stringent lockdowns enforced by governments to contain the virus have triggered unprecedented intervention into not just financial markets, but also the day-to-day wheels of global commerce. From buying bonds to paying wages, authorities are playing a role in the economy that was unimaginable even a few months ago.To be clear, it\u2019s not like they had much choice. The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market \u2014 whether it\u2019s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies \u2014 the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come.

Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the world\u2019s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the \u201cblame game,\u201d saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,\u201d he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country\u2019s exit from lockdown. With Europe\u2019s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country\u2019s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled. Trump supports Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s proposal for a summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members and sent him a message describing the initiative as a \u201cgood idea,\u201d\u00a0the American ambassador to Moscow told the Interfax news service.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) \u2014 Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a\u00a0third in six weeks while much\u00a0of the commodities universe melts down.\u00a0Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of\u00a0pandemic-related mine closures, are\u00a0adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand\u00a0softened\u00a0by industrial\u00a0lockdowns. There will be\u00a0no swift return to lofty levels\u00a0last seen over a decade ago, but the metal\u00a0may still be the only\u00a0one to\u00a0end the year with a\u00a0record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run\u00a0had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged\u00a0by a factor of 13\u00a0between 2003 and 2007.\u00a0That hastened a production\u00a0splurge\u00a0that\u00a0put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened\u00a0by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It\u00a0then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce\u00a0more at depressed\u00a0prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments\u00a0at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada\u2019s\u00a0Cameco has suspended production at\u00a0its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan.\u00a0Kazakhstan\u2019s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates\u00a0Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It\u2019s true that almost all metals have seen a blow\u00a0to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that\u2019s\u00a0dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers,\u00a0whose own factories have been\u00a0shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to\u00a0earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only\u00a0platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled\u00a0by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34\u00a0per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others\u00a0have climbed, too:\u00a0London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF\u00a0have recovered\u00a0from their 2020 nadirs.The real question\u00a0is what happens next. Even\u00a0$34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A\u00a0significant proportion of producers still don\u2019t\u00a0make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities\u00a0are sitting on a still-substantial four\u00a0years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It\u00a0could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to\u00a0get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit\u00a0will keep\u00a0upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO\u00a0estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners\u00a0is close\u00a0to $55, though\u00a0existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even\u00a0an approval today\u00a0won\u2019t ease the squeeze fast: A\u00a0new uranium operation takes years.Then there\u2019s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It\u00a0remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as\u00a0traditional users find their reactors are aging,\u00a0and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher:\u00a0The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide\u00a0emissions almost\u00a0equivalent to\u00a0two years of those related to\u00a0global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a\u00a0renewed preoccupation\u00a0with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses\u00a0when it comes to a metal that\u00a0isn\u2019t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling,\u00a0too.\u00a0For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable.

Yet the number of open positions has dwindled as layoffs become more common and many of the jobs that do exist are temporary.Vangst, which runs the Gigs site for temporary pot jobs and recently launched a platform for full-time positions, is filling about 600 jobs a week. That\u2019s a slight decrease from pre-COVID-19 levels earlier this year, mostly because companies are employing fewer in-store staff as they switch to delivery or curbside pickup. Meanwhile, the number of job candidates on the platform surged by 300 per cent between March and April, according to Karson Humiston, founder and chief executive officer of Vangst.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge uptick in candidates, and we\u2019re seeing a large number of candidates coming from hospitality and retail,\u201d Humiston said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen our clients do pick up hiring again, they\u2019re going to have access to a really strong talent pool.\u201dOf the temporary jobs that are being filled on Vangst\u2019s Gigs platform, about half are replacements for employees who are unable to work and the other half are for normal seasonal work related to harvests or packaging, she said.The cannabis sector employed 243,700 people at the beginning of 2020, up 15 per cent from the prior year and nearly double the number of jobs in 2017, according to data from cannabis information firm Leafly. However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it\u2019s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5 per cent of its total workforce. That\u2019s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.\u201cWhen you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that\u2019s a signal of what\u2019s going on in the broader market,\u201d Humiston said. \u201cWe were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then COVID-19 came and exacerbated it.\u201dNot everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call centre volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It\u2019s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but \u201cat this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,\u201d Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she\u2019s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it\u2019s hired.\u201cWe prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Consumer Sentiment Improves Slightly in Canada After Collapse", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The plunge in Canadian consumer confidence over the past couple of months seems to have come to a halt for now, with sentiment levels stabilizing for a third ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/consumer-sentiment-improves-slightly-in-canada-after-collapse", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020 2:24 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The plunge in Canadian consumer confidence over the past couple of months seems to have come to a halt for now, with sentiment levels stabilizing for a third straight week.The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index ticked up slightly last week, its first gain since early February.

Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings.

The decision will likely cost him more than $1 million in loss of salary and unvested Amazon stock, \u201cnot to mention the best job I ever had,\u201d he said.\u00a0Amazon has been fighting the spread of coronavirus cases in its logistics network and a public-relations battle against critics who say the company hasn\u2019t done enough to make warehouses safe. Small groups of workers at facilities around the U.S. have walked off the job in protest, and an employee activist group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, called for corporate employees to call in sick after two of its members were fired.Amazon has said the workers were fired for violating corporate policy forbidding them from speaking publicly about internal matters. The company declined to comment on Bray\u2019s resignation.Bray, who last year signed the employee group\u2019s open letter urging Amazon to do more to fight climate change, said he raised concerns about the firings internally. Having done that, he said, \u201cremaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned.\u201d\u00a0He said he believed both that Amazon was making massive investments to keep workers safe during the pandemic, and that workers who have spoken out have legitimate concerns. In the essay, Bray said the company was treating warehouse workers like \u201cfungible units of pick-and-pack potential.\u201d He chalked up some of what he sees as Amazon\u2019s failings to its success in a capitalist system not set up incentivize good treatment of workers.\u201cAmazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don\u2019t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don\u2019t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward, Bray wrote.Don\u2019t say it can\u2019t be done, because France is doing it.\u201d\u201cFiring whistleblowers isn\u2019t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets,\u201d Bray wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.

It\u2019s a time when Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders converge on Nebraska to eat Dairy Queen ice cream, sample See\u2019s Candies and, most importantly, hear the wit and wisdom of one of the world\u2019s most successful investors.The booths offering sweet treats will be missing on Saturday, as will the tens of thousands of attendees. Even the location is being kept under wraps. But Buffett and a top deputy, Greg Abel, will be there, doing their best in a virtual meeting to make sense of an economy upended by the coronavirus pandemic.Even without the event\u2019s usual trappings, interest is, if anything, even more intense than usual. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, has been relatively quiet over the past month as the global response to the pandemic escalated, drawing questions about his view of what might be in store for the markets, Berkshire\u2019s businesses and the global economy.\u201cThe tone will be different,\u201d said Richard Cook, a shareholder who has missed just two meetings since attending his first in 1997. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly miss all these chances to see all those friends.\u201dMeyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year\u2019s event will likely lack \u201cthe celebratory feel that it had in the past.\u201dThere\u2019s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown. In one of Buffett\u2019s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a \u201cbig one-two punch.\u201dHis Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse.Buffett, now with roughly $128 billion in cash, hasn\u2019t announced any large public deals even as the S&P 500 tumbled 20% in the first quarter.Charlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman who in normal years fields questions at the meeting with Buffett, offered one explanation in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in early April. The conglomerate wants to come out of the coronavirus \u201ctyphoon\u201d with lots of liquidity, Munger said, adding that many corporate executives are frozen in place as they try to figure out how to handle the crisis.Berkshire\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing off the hook, he told the newspaper.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said it\u2019s possible Berkshire will still make a move. \u201cBut the other thing is, when you have the government becoming the lender of last resort, you don\u2019t necessarily need Berkshire to be the lender of last resort,\u201d she said.Berkshire plans to start its event at 3:45 p.m. Omaha time on Saturday, with Buffett and Abel fielding questions shareholders sent to three hand-picked journalists. The company is set to release first-quarter results earlier that day.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe decline in Berkshire's equity portfolio was about $66 billion at quarter end, and a steep drop in Berkshire's stock increases the potential for buybacksThe company warned that the pair would steer clear of political questions and discussions about specific holdings at the meeting, which has morphed from a small gathering in the lunchroom of one of Buffett\u2019s insurers into a sprawling event the billionaire has called a \u201cWoodstock for Capitalists.\u201dHere are some of the topics that might come up:The company\u2019s first-quarter earnings report will give investors a better sense of whether Buffett and his investing deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, found opportunities in the turmoil caused by the virus.Berkshire\u2019s quarterly filing usually discloses how much in stocks the company purchased during the quarter and the total size of the investment portfolio, including its largest holdings. Berkshire recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.Buffett\u2019s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett\u2019s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental\u2019s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire\u2019s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW\u2019s Shields.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, \u2018Hey, this is expensive, but it\u2019s got this great ringing endorsement,\u2019 because that\u2019s not how it\u2019s working out,\u201d Shields said.Berkshire\u2019s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Chubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers\u2019 compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire\u2019s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201cIt\u2019s so different based on the insurance product line,\u201d Shields said. \u201cThere are some lines that have major questions,\u201d especially with business-interruption coverage.Buffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire\u2019s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire\u2019s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year\u2019s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year\u2019s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.\u201cIt\u2019s really, really important,\u201d Shields said. While there\u2019s no indication that any change would happen now, \u201cat some point in time, it\u2019s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it\u2019s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.\u201dCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See\u2019s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF\u2019s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn\u2019t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire\u2019s breadth \u2014 with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations \u2014 gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.\u201cBuffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,\u201d Cook said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Ramli and Danielle Bochove", "title": "'Enough is enough': Hedge fund pushes Teck Resources to abandon oil and coal, replace CEO", "description": "Tribeca Investment Partners said pivoting to a pure base metals miner would improve environmental credentials and lead to a six-fold share gain over the next year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/hedge-fund-pressures-teck-to-abandon-oil-replace-ceo-lindsay", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/teck.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 30, 2020 1:11 PM EDT", "content": "Teck Resources Ltd. has been targeted by a hedge fund shareholder that\u2019s pushing the underperforming Canadian miner to divest its energy and coal businesses and consider replacing long-standing Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay.Tribeca Investment Partners said making those changes and pivoting to a pure base metals miner would improve Teck\u2019s environmental credentials and could lead to a six-fold share gain over the next year. The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board.\u201cThere\u2019s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,\u201d said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn\u2019t received the letter. \u201cI can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,\u201d Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.\u201cThe Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck\u2019s management,\u201d Sheila Murray, Teck\u2019s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada\u2019s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.The activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company\u2019s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because \u201cenough is enough,\u201d Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca\u2019s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world\u2019s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn\u2019t working with other investors. Teck\u2019s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Last year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn\u2019t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck\u2019s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.\u201cThere is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,\u201d the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 yearsTeck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.\u201cI don\u2019t see this as a \u2018Keevils or nothing\u2019 issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,\u201d Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.The hedge fund\u2019s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn\u2019t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund\u2019s investments are in oil transportation and service providers. The metallurgical coal produced by Teck is used mainly for steel making and not for burning in power plants.Even so, it believes that cutting off oil and coal would attract the rising pool of pension funds and family offices that are restricting their investments in companies based on their environmental impact.\u201cYou can either do something now and see a material upside or you can continue to de-rate and be an orphan stock in the global materials universe,\u201d Cleary said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dana Hull, Gabrielle Coppola and Ed Ludlow", "title": "'Give people back their goddamn freedom': Musk's rant puts Tesla's hot streak at risk", "description": "Tesla is worried about being able to resume production in the San Francisco Bay area, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/musk-decries-fascist-orders-putting-teslas-hot-streak-at-risk", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/musk.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 30, 2020 8:44 AM EDT", "content": "Elon Musk went on a profane rant during another emotive Tesla Inc. earnings call, excoriating stay-at-home orders that are putting the electric-car maker\u2019s red-hot run at risk.\u201cThis is fascist.

The company\u2019s third straight quarterly profit and revenue of almost US$6 billion both beat analysts\u2019 estimates, extending an advance for a stock that\u2019s already the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year.\u201cIt was vintage Elon.

It doesn\u2019t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.\u201dThe stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.\u201cIt is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,\u201d Tesla said in its quarterly update. \u201cDue to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.\u201dDuring the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to \u201ccomfortably\u201d exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.\u201cGross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,\u201d Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. \u201cOn the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn\u2019t talk about demand at all.\u201dTesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla\u2019s semi truck again to 2021 \u2014 roughly two years later than initially planned \u2014 as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.\u201cTesla investors are looking past the June quarter,\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. \u201cThe bulls could take this and run.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dina Bass", "title": "Microsoft sales rise as remote working buoys cloud services", "description": "Microsoft CEO's years-long push for the company to focus on cloud software pays off", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/microsoft-sales-rise-as-remote-working-buoys-cloud-services", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/microsoft.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 4:43 PM EDT", "content": "Microsoft Corp. said quarterly sales and profit rose, buoyed by demand for internet-based software and cloud services needed to accommodate a shift to remote working during the coronavirus crisis.Profit in the period ended March 31 rose to US$10.8 billion, or US$1.40 a share, the company said Wednesday in a statement.

The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "K.

Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers\u2019 lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits \u2013 lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That\u2019s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that\u2019s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cThese claims are enormous \u2013 nothing the industry\u2019s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,\u201d said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry\u2019s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn\u2019t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes\u2019 case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an \u201cuphill battle,\u201d Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers\u2019 tickets. \u201cProvided that\u2019s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.\u201dIt\u2019s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.\u201cIf you print out one of these tickets, it\u2019s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,\u201d said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. \u201cMost people have no idea the limitations they\u2019re presented with.\u201dFor example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it\u2019s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines \u201ctook immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,\u201d said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. \u201cImportantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.\u201dThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes\u2019 tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a \u201cpatently unfair\u201d prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged \u201csignificant hurdles\u201d for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted \u201cintentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus\u201d for which there\u2019s no vaccine.If the case isn\u2019t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs\u2019 law firms that pursue them do so on a \u201cno win, no fee\u201d basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.\u201cThe ship never should have sailed,\u201d Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. \u201cThey put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.\u201dHe and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship\u2019s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was \u201cnot even connected to any flu-like symptoms,\u201d said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator\u2019s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes\u2019 cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival\u2019s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship\u2019s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn\u2019t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik\u2019s office said it\u2019s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company\u2019s response to the Covid-19 outbreak \u201chas focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.\u201d She said the company doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they \u201cmay have been exposed.\u201d It was then \u2013 two weeks after the voyage began \u2013 that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company\u2019s response was reasonable under the circumstances. \u201cThis is a generational global event \u2014 it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said.Before the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there\u2019d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers\u2019 experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn\u2019t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes\u2019 lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival\u2019s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC\u2019s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean\u2019s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships \u201ctypically perform extremely well\u201d during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven\u2019t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. \u201cThere are still a lot of ifs\u201d about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.\u201cThe industry hasn\u2019t had any calamitous losses \u2013 nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,\u201d Klein said.\u00a0\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jen Skerritt and Shelly Hagan", "title": "Boneless chicken starts to vanish amid meatpacking plant shutdowns", "description": "The poultry industry is shifting away from de-boning to ramp up production", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/boneless-chicken-starts-to-vanish-in-u-s-meatpacking-shutdowns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/chicken-drumsticks.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 28, 2020 5:34 PM EDT", "content": "Goodbye, boneless chicken.Food retailers across North America are swapping boneless chicken legs for less popular thighs and drumsticks as a wave of shutdowns at meatpacking plants has reduced supplies of sought-after cuts.COVID-19 infections among workers at some of the largest meat processing plants in the U.S. and Canada have reduced slaughter capacity, and in some cases the types of cuts available. Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open. In Canada, Cargill Inc. has idled its beef plant in High River, Alberta, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada\u2019s processing capacity while JBS SA\u2019s beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, is running at about half capacity.Quebec-based Goodfood Market Corp., which delivers meals on a subscription basis, said it will be substituting its regular boneless chicken for bone-in thighs, legs and drumsticks as the poultry industry shifts away from de-boning to ramp up production.\u201cPoultry suppliers are still facing labour shortages and many of them are operating with less than 50 per cent of their regular workforce,\u201d Goodfood Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ferrari wrote in an email to customers. \u201cTo ensure the essential supply of chicken for Canadians across the country, the poultry industry as a whole is shifting away from de-boning chicken legs to increase their production capacity.\u201dFerrari also wrote that the company is working to secure a frozen beef supply in case shutdowns at Alberta\u2019s beef suppliers disrupt the supply chain.Grocers generally are accepting cuts of meat that require more cutting by their in-house butchers to keep their meat counters as full as possible, said Michael Young, president of Canada Beef.Meat such as sirloin and strip loins that would have typically been sent to restaurants before the pandemic shuttered businesses are now increasingly sold by retailers who are offering them in different sizes to get the price point down, he said. Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called \u201cend cuts\u201d from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks \u2014 from the leg of a cow \u2014 on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Consumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill\u2019s protein and salt businesses. While the company\u2019s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.\u201cWe know they\u2019re buying cuts that they\u2019ve never bought before,\u201d Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there\u2019s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors\u2019 Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said. A lot more ground meat is typically sold by comparison, which causes an imbalance.\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting to see if enough has changed to eat our way out of the problem,\u201d Allen said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matt Day", "title": "Amazon warehouses are safer, but returning workers are still scared", "description": "A test of Amazon's progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/amazon-warehouses-are-safer-but-returning-workers-are-still-scared", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 28, 2020 3:13 PM EDT", "content": "In the breakroom at an Amazon.com Inc. warehouse in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania, a PowerPoint presentation playing on repeat shows people in hazmat suits making their way through the giant facility, spraying disinfectant.

Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world\u2019s largest online retailer.\u00a0A\u00a0vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease\u2019s spread\u00a0within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it\u2019s safe to\u00a0show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick\u00a0and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon\u2019s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off \u2014 no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon\u2019s efforts echo what\u2019s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic.Amazon hasn\u2019t said how many of its workers took\u00a0unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of\u00a0their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon\u2019s new safety procedures firsthand.\u00a0Employees who feel they can\u2019t return because they\u2019re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She\u2019s since returned. \u201cI would have stayed home again if they didn\u2019t make the changes they have,\u201d she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is \u201cproviding flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email. \u201cWe continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.\u201d The company said it doesn\u2019t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.The coronavirus first struck Amazon\u2019s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus\u2019s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company\u2019s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building\u2019s top manager wasn\u2019t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn\u2019t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn\u2019t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it\u2019s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor \u2014 ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when\u00a0admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they\u2019re\u00a0being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a\u00a0hallway.Despite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon\u2019s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at\u00a0warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. \u201cWe have full shifts in all departments, but it\u2019s seasonal workers,\u201d said Jaylen Camp, who works at\u00a0a\u00a0facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for\u00a0the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. \u201cIt\u2019s all new people surrounding me daily,\u201d said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired\u00a0employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week\u00a0New York\u2019s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics\u00a0with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon\u00a0advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing\u00a0protective gear.\u00a0Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse. Today's visits by our founder and CEO @JeffBezos to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and @WholeFoods employees.

Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren\u2019t eligible.

He didn\u2019t elaborate.The order, though, will not be limited to Tyson, the person said. It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump\u2019s order sets the stage for a showdown between America\u2019s meat giants, who\u2019ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who\u2019ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry productsThe White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down. Meat stocks rose on the news.But a union representing plant workers accused the administration of failing to develop meaningful safety requirements that would have helped contain the disruptions.\u201cWe only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.Tyson Foods extended gains, jumping as much as 5.6 per cent for the biggest intraday advance in three weeks. Hormel Foods Corp. rose 1 per cent, while JBS SA\u2019s American depositary receipts climbed 4.6 per cent.On Sunday, Tyson Foods Chairman John Tyson said in a blog post that the U.S. food supply chain \u201cis breaking,\u201d with millions of pounds of meat set to \u201cdisappear\u201d as plants close.Illnesses in the meat-processing industry and shifts in demand after restaurants closed have disrupted the supply chain. Dairy farmers are dumping milk that can\u2019t be sold to processors, broiler operations have been breaking eggs to reduce supplies and some fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields amid labor and distribution disruptions.Many low-income Americans, meanwhile, have been waiting in long lines at food banks, which have reported shortages.Asked about the country\u2019s food supply, Trump said: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of supply.\u201dThe Defense Production Act allows the government broad power to direct industrial production in crises. Trump has previously invoked the law \u2014 or threatened to invoke it \u2014 in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa\u2019s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities \u201cas soon as it is possible to do so safely.\u201d Iowa produces one-third of the nation\u2019s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Across the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with \u201cdepopulation and disposal methods\u201d for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world\u2019s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African swine fever, which destroyed millions of the country\u2019s pigs.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Javier Blas", "title": "We're about to reach the inevitable next chapter of the oil crisis: The industry shuts down", "description": "'No one is going to be able to dodge this bullet'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/the-next-chapter-of-the-oil-crisis-the-industry-shuts-down?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/oil-rig.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 28, 2020 11:50 AM EDT", "content": "Negative oil prices, ships dawdling at sea with unwanted cargoes, and traders getting creative about where to stash oil. The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers \u2014 a sign of just how distorted the market has become.The spectre of production shut-downs \u2014 and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies \u2014 was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It\u2019s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.\u201cWe are moving into the end-game,\u201d Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. \u201cEarly-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.\u201dIn theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it\u2019s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameThe best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.\u201cMonday really focused people\u2019s minds that production needs to slow down,\u201d Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.\u201dTrafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. \u201cThe severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,\u201d said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.North Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state\u2019s total.The output cuts won\u2019t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,\u201d Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. \u201cIn certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.\u201dIn emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that\u2019s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it\u2019s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What\u2019s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.Before the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.But before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate. U.S. oil refiners processed just 12.45 million barrels a day on the week to April 17, the lowest amount in at least 30 years, except for hurricane-related closures.More refinery shutdowns are coming, oil traders and consultants said, particularly in the U.S. where lockdowns started later than in Europe and demand is still contracting. Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, said that global refineries could halt as much as 25 per cent of total capacity in May.\u201cNo one is going to be able to dodge this bullet.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michael Bellusci and Kevin Orland", "title": "Canada's big oil producers will start reporting earnings tomorrow.

The fund said it\u2019s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn\u2019t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold \u201csignificant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.\u201dThe ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it\u2019s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.\u201cWhile it is USO\u2019s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,\u201d it said in the filing, adding that USO investors \u201cshould expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO\u2019s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.\u201dThe US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn\u2019t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including \u201ca change in regulator accountability levels and position limits\u201d as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that\u2019s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that\u2019s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "OMERS to launch $750-million venture fund to back tech companies", "description": "OMERS is set to announce two investments in Canadian startups in the coming weeks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/omers-to-launch-750-million-venture-fund-to-back-tech-companies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/money-7.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 8:52 AM EDT", "content": "The Ontario Municipal Employment Retirement System is launching a venture capital fund to back early-stage technology companies in North America and Europe.The US$750-million fund is OMERS\u2019 first transatlantic venture vehicle, the Globe and Mail reported.

Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.RioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The shortlist for the next Bank of Canada governor is down to two names", "description": "The pressure is on for Finance Minister Bill Morneau to name a replacement to allow for a transitional period at a crucial time for the central bank", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/shortlist-for-next-bank-of-canada-governor-is-down-to-two-names", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bank-of-canada-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 6:38 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s search for a successor to Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is entering its final days with the government having already reduced the shortlist of candidates to two, according to people familiar with the matter.As Poloz prepares to step down on June 2, the pressure is on Trudeau\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, to name a replacement to allow for a transitional period at a time when the central bank is on the frontlines of fighting the economic fallout of the coronavirus.Poloz\u2019s top deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, who has played a central role in the central bank\u2019s response to the crisis, is one of the remaining contenders, according to the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified because the matter is confidential. While the second name has yet to emerge in public, BlackRock Inc.\u2019s Jean Boivin is no longer in contention. Tiff Macklem, dean of the University of Toronto\u2019s management school and a former central bank official, regularly features in speculation, though it\u2019s unclear whether he has sought the position.Whoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that\u2019s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada\u2019s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank\u2019s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.\u201cYou need someone forceful,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere does have to be some push back.\u201dThe outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today\u2019s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons \u2014 the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada\u2019s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank\u2019s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that\u2019s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion \u2014 a gap that\u2019s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulWith the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada\u2019s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada\u2019s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. \u201cSomeday the tensions will ease back and we won\u2019t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,\u201d the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts. It\u2019s one thing for the central bank to finance income support measures, another for it to fund agendas.In the short term, it\u2019s all academic. With the economy in crisis and inflation nowhere in sight, keeping the taps open is the only option.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Marvin G.

They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They\u2019re stress baking, but they\u2019re also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has \u201ccompletely changed everything,\u201d said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.\u201cPeople are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really changes the mindset of a consumer.\u201dSome of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world\u2019s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that\u2019s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico\u2019s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That\u2019s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.\u201cThere is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,\u201d said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.For a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago \u2014 packaged foods in particular have been given new life.\u201cTraditionally, food has a comforting role,\u201d Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.\u201cIt moved in waves, but everything is moving,\u201d he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That\u2019s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they\u2019re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching \u201cTiger King\u201d on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Even with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium\u2019s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world\u2019s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.\u201cThere\u2019s a simplification going on,\u201d Fereday said. Packaged foods are \u201ccertainly more available because there\u2019s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello", "title": "A fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec", "description": "Quebec is urging its population to buy from local firms through an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/a-fight-against-amazon-becomes-a-state-matter-in-quebec", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 25, 2020 8:02 AM EDT", "content": "The coronavirus crisis is giving Quebec\u2019s nationalist government an excuse to attempt what may be impossible.The Canadian province is embarking on an uphill battle to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s position. Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers\u2019 digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu \u2014 or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province\u2019s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe\u2019s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon\u2019s dominance.\u201cPeople will be able to see what\u2019s available in their region,\u201d Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.\u201dQuebec\u2019s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company\u2019s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.The track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,\u201d Lecours said. \u201cStill, let\u2019s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it\u2019s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?\u201dEfforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch \u2014 including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV\u2019s beer.When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer \u2014 an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.\u201cAn initiative to promote local commerce isn\u2019t an initiative against free trade,\u201d Fitzgibbon said then. \u201cIt\u2019s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.\u201dThe Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn\u2019t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it\u2019s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the \u201cBuy Quebec\u201d movement to stay.\u201cNo one can compete with Amazon,\u201d she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don\u2019t sell on the behemoth\u2019s platform, \u201cwe have some exclusivity they don\u2019t have.\u201dOnline shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling \u201cBlack Friday level traffic every day\u201d to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault\u2019s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.\u201cI made no money,\u201d he said. Shipping costs \u201cis what\u2019s hurting everyone.\u201dTaillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket\u2019s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers\u2019 attention.\u201cOur goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,\u201d he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, \u201cit will have been worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michael Hirtzer and Tatiana Freitas", "title": "America could be weeks from meat shortages with shutdowns spreading", "description": "Plant shutdowns in U.S., Canada and Brazil, which produce 65% of world meat trade, threaten supply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/meat-supply-threats-grow-with-first-brazil-shutdown-u-s-turkey-halt?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/meat-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 24, 2020 2:58 PM EDT", "content": "Plant shutdowns are leaving the U.S. dangerously close to meat shortages as coronavirus outbreaks spread to suppliers across the nation and the Americas.Almost a third of U.S. pork capacity is down, the first big poultry plants closed on Friday and experts are warning that domestic shortages are just weeks away. Brazil, the world\u2019s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world\u2019s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unprecedented,\u201d said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. \u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.\u201d\u00a0New U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world\u2019s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin.The most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.\u201cDuring this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation\u2019s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,\u201d Smithfield said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful choice; it\u2019s not one we wish on anyone.\u201dPrices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike\u2019s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.\u201cWe\u2019re backing it up already because of the coming \u2014 we feel \u2014 the coming shortages,\u201d said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven\u2019t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn\u2019t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn\u2019t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there\u2019s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world\u2019s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country\u2019s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don\u2019t have a place to sell their animals. That\u2019s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It\u2019s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That\u2019s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on \u201cdepopulation and disposal methods.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling \u2014 so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as \u201celbow-to-elbow.\u201d Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there\u2019s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day \u2014 it\u2019s basically the opposite of social distancing.At the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That\u2019s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there\u2019s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS\u2019s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant \u201care fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.\u201d The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that \u201cemployee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.\u201dThe closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.\u201cBrazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don\u2019t see progress in agglomeration of people,\u201d said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. \u201cThey are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces", "description": "Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government \u2014 which could trigger a downgrade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country\u2019s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada\u2019s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada\u2019s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days.Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.\u201cThere is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point\u201d for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.Canadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada\u2019s profile as similar to Australia \u2014 whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 \u2014 and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada\u2019s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.\u201cThe fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low \u2014 I think that will be very important for the credit rating,\u201d said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada\u2019s top credit rating as \u201cextremely resilient,\u201d citing the central government\u2019s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is \u201camong the weak\u201d AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn\u2019t an automatic trigger for a credit action.While the federal government doesn\u2019t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s rating of A1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of \u201ca high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in an April 1 statement. Moody\u2019s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It\u2019s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.\u201cWe still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,\u201d said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.\u201cOil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,\u201d said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That\u2019s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.\u201cProvincials are absolutely key for Canada\u2019s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces\u2019 credit ratings may be \u201ccalled into question.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mark Gurman, Debby Wu and Ian King", "title": "Apple aims to sell Macs with its own chips starting in 2021", "description": "The initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/apple-aims-to-sell-macs-with-its-own-chips-starting-in-2021", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/apple-mac.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 7:01 AM EDT", "content": "Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple\u2019s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple\u2019s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel\u2019s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company\u2019s first custom Mac chips won\u2019t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple\u2019s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company\u2019s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple\u2019s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple\u2019s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro\u2019s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company\u2019s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel\u2019s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel\u2019s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel\u2019s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple\u2019s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems \u2014 chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls \u2014 after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel\u2019s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett stays silent as even his \u2018fortress\u2019 is breached by coronavirus shutdowns", "description": "\u2018We've got a few businesses, small ones, we won't reopen when this is over\u2019 \u2014 Charlie Munger", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/warren-buffetts-fortress-is-breached-by-coronavirus-related-shutdowns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/warren-buffett-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 5:27 AM EDT", "content": "Even as market watchers await Warren Buffett\u2019s splashy move to seize on fallout from the current crisis, his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. hasn\u2019t been spared by the pandemic.Coronavirus-related shutdowns across the U.S. have hit Berkshire units from See\u2019s Candies and a shoemaker to industrial behemoth Precision Castparts. That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett\u2019s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won\u2019t reopen when this is over,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.\u201cThere\u2019s no fortress that\u2019s immune to that right now,\u201d said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book \u201cMargin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.\u201dSome Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See\u2019s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire\u2019s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett\u2019s promise that Berkshire will \u201cforever remain a financial fortress\u201d hasn\u2019t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.\u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near business as usual, of course,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there\u2019s a coronavirus pandemic.\u201dSchnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he\u2019s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn\u2019t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.\u2019s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire\u2019s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett\u2019s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren\u2019t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this \u201ctyphoon,\u201d Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire\u2019s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett\u2019s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett\u2019s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Buffett has yet to announce a similar deal recently, shareholder Thomas Russo said Buffett\u2019s ability to evaluate unique opportunities may help again.\u201cHe\u2019s patient,\u201d said Russo, who oversees about US$10 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo & Gardner. \u201cOne of the best features is that he is able to see opportunities broadly.\u201dBuffett, 89, is set to host a virtual version of Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, an event that normally draws thousands of visitors to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Investors hope he\u2019ll have the \u201cwashtub\u201d that he described in his 2017 annual letter:\u201cEvery decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold,\u201d Buffett wrote. \u201cWhen downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons.

A survey of CFIB members shows 80% of small and medium firms are closed or operating at reduced capacity because of the pandemic, meaning only 20 per cent are fully operational.\u201cEven in the optimistic scenario with full utilization of all of these support programs, I still see no scenario under which there are not tens of thousands of permanent business closures,\u201d Kelly said Wednesday by phone from Toronto.The federal government has stepped up aid to businesses, introducing measures such as a 75 per cent wage subsidy and $40,000 loans, and a rent relief program is expected soon. But the measures weren\u2019t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren\u2019t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government\u2019s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario.\u201cThe bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that\u2019s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,\u201d Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.\u201dAnd if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,\u201d Yussuff said. \u201cThis is a very difficult time so workers don\u2019t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "James Tarmy", "title": "Bored rich people are wearing big diamonds at home, buying pricy jewels to spark joy amid pandemic", "description": "The wealthy are spending lockdown buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/bored-rich-people-are-wearing-big-diamonds-at-home-buying-pricy-jewels-to-spark-joy-amid-pandemic", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sothebys.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 12:51 PM EDT", "content": "Catharine Becket, a specialist at Sotheby\u2019s in charge of its \u201cmagnificent jewels\u201d sale in New York, had been working on obtaining a specific 1930s diamond and enamel bracelet by Cartier for five years. \u201cWe\u2019d always hoped it might come to auction,\u201d she says, \u201cand it was just this winter that I spoke to the client, and she decided it was time to sell.\u201d The bracelet, known as a \u201cTutti Frutti\u201d for its multicoloured, Mughal-cut stones, is one of the most recognizable designs Cartier ever made, and several bracelets of the same style and from the same period have sold for millions of dollars.Becket\u2019s client had inherited the bracelet years ago, and she\u2019d worn it \u201cI think\u00a0once,\u201d Becket says. After some discussion, the client agreed to put the piece of jewelry\u00a0up for auction at the\u00a0major spring sale at Sotheby\u2019s New York, which was supposed to be held in late April.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.Live auctions were called off, and Sotheby\u2019s pivoted to online sales. With global economies faltering, U.S. equity markets whipsawing, and people stuck at home indefinitely, the success of online jewelry sales was far from certain. Becket called the bracelet\u2019s owner\u00a0\u201cand told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale\u00a0or deferred to a live auction at a later date.\u201dBut to Becket\u2019s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well \u2014 very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. \u201cClients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,\u201d she says. Some, Becket adds, told her \u201cthey\u2019re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.\u201dEveryone, she says, \u201cis waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.\u201dThe results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby\u2019s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,\u201d Becket says, \u201cand actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.\u201d A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of \u00a390,000 (US$110,000) sold for \u00a3162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for \u00a350,000, above a high estimate of \u00a332,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that \u201cI could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we\u2019d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.\u201d The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.The rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.\u201cPolished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,\u201d Rapaport wrote, while \u201cshipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel\u2019s plummeted by 73 per cent.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cinventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.\u201dIf buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.\u201cI don\u2019t think people were buying for the sake of investment,\u201d Becket says. \u201cWe had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.\u201d It\u2019s true, she continues, that \u201cthere has been a softening\u201d in the auction\u00a0market for jewelry\u00a0as the value of loose stones\u00a0has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.\u201cThe Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,\u201d because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. \u201cSo the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.\u201dNow\u00a0the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost\u00a0a million dollars on a bracelet they\u2019ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says,\u00a0people are most willing to buy things with which they\u2019re familiar: a Cartier \u201cLove\u201d bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as\u00a0Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a \u201cbroadening\u201d of what\u2019s done well at auction. \u201cA multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn\u2019t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,\u201d she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers\u2019 willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.\u201cIf these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,\u201d she\u00a0says, \u201cwhere people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Elena Mazneva", "title": "\u2018The Fed can\u2019t print gold\u2019: How the yellow metal could hit $3,000 \u2014 50% above the current record", "description": "Bank of America\u2019s bullish call on bullion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/gold-to-reach-3000-50-above-its-record-bank-of-america-says?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/gold-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 12:45 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of America Corp. raised its 18-month gold-price target to US$3,000 an ounce \u2014 more than 50 per cent above the existing price record \u2014 in a report titled \u201cThe Fed can\u2019t print gold.\u201dThe bank increased its target from US$2,000 previously, as policy makers across the globe unleash vast amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus to help shore up economies hurt by the coronavirus.\u201cAs economic output contracts sharply, fiscal outlays surge, and central bank balance sheets double, fiat currencies could come under pressure,\u201d analysts including Michael Widmer and Francisco Blanch said in the report. \u201cInvestors will aim for gold.\u201dBofA expects bullion to average US$1,695 an ounce this year and US$2,063 in 2021.

While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify\u2019s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada\u2019s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jen Skerritt and Deena Shanker", "title": "Food rationing is the new unnerving reality for grocery shoppers once spoiled for choice", "description": "North American shoppers are finding they can't get everything they want as grocery stores ration in-demand items to safeguard supplies", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/food-rationing-is-new-reality-for-buyers-once-spoiled-for-choice?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bread.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 10:59 AM EDT", "content": "At a Publix store in St. Petersburg, Florida, handmade signs limit customers to two packages of beef, pork and Italian sausage. In Toronto, shoppers at a west end Loblaws can\u2019t buy more than two dozen eggs and two gallons of milk.Spoiled for choice before the pandemic, North American shoppers are finding they can\u2019t get everything they want as grocery stores ration in-demand items to safeguard supplies.While the panic that swept through supermarkets in the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdowns has eased, people are still filling fridges and pantries with stay-at-home staples from flour and yeast to pasta sauce and meat.The strong demand comes at a time of supply disruptions as food makers adapt to dramatic shifts in buying patterns and some processing plants close as workers fall ill. As a result, stores are restricting purchases to prevent items from vanishing from shelves. For shoppers, that can be unnerving.\u201cIt\u2019s not a shortage, it\u2019s just that it needs to get from the supplier throughout the supply chain to the stores,\u201d said Diane Brisebois, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Council of Canada. \u201cThere\u2019s been an unexpected increase in demand for those products, and if those demands continue, it might take a bit longer to get them to the shelves.\u201dOverall, there\u2019s enough retail supply, said Heather Garlich, a spokesperson for FMI, a food industry association that represents retailers and producers.But there have been \u201csporadic challenges\u201d with high-demand products, and 49 per cent of U.S. shoppers report their supermarket has had products out of stock, according to the industry\u2019s tracking. On popular items, \u201cthey could consider limits based on where the grocer may be located and when their supplier or wholesalers can get them product,\u201d Garlich said.The dizzying variety of foods on grocery shelves has long been a trademark of North American supermarkets. That\u2019s now changing, leaving shoppers worried. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus to making more of just a few core products, which makes it easier for retailers to restock supplies.\u201cThe thing I\u2019m struck by, in the U.S., we\u2019re so used to walking down a supermarket aisle and having thousands of choices,\u201d said Heidi Heitkamp, a former North Dakota Senator and current member of alliantgroup\u2019s strategic advisory board. \u201cNow that\u2019s not what people see on the shelves and it\u2019s a little unnerving. But what everyone should be grateful for is that you can walk into any supermarket in a major metro area and you can find food to eat. That\u2019s a critically important national security concern.\u201dThere are signs that panic buying is waning and shoppers are returning to more traditional patterns. U.S. packaged food sales rose 24 per cent in the week ended April 4 from a year ago, slowing from a gain of 32 per cent a week earlier, according to data compiled by Nielsen. Limits on the number of visitors per store are also affecting sales.Costco Wholesale Corp.\u2019s sales rose in March but not as much as expected. Limits placed on its operations to cope with coronavirus-related demand slowed growth in the back half of the month.\u201cI honestly think rationing may disappear at some point over the next few weeks because expectations have changed a little bit,\u201d said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. \u201cPeople have come to accept what\u2019s happening right now.\u201dAnd while meat aisles remain stocked, the spread of coronavirus among North American slaughterhouses is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores. The shutdown of major U.S. processing plants, including Tyson Foods Inc.\u2019s Waterloo plant in Iowa this week, means more than 15 per cent of the nation\u2019s hog-slaughtering capacity is down.\u201cOnce we see the impact of workers testing positive in the packing plants, we\u2019re going to see a shortage of meat,\u201d said Heitkamp, the former senator.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Robert Tuttle", "title": "Oil tankers carrying 20 million barrels of crude are surrounding California with nowhere to unload", "description": "Almost three dozen ships \u2014 scattered in waters from Long Beach to San Francisco Bay \u2014 are mostly acting as floating storage for oil going unused", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-tankers-carrying-20-million-barrels-of-crude-are-surrounding-california-with-nowhere-to-unload?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/oil-tanker.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 10:47 AM EDT", "content": "Oil tankers carrying enough crude to satisfy 20 per cent of the world\u2019s daily consumption are gathered off California\u2019s coast with nowhere to go as fuel demand collapses.Almost three dozen ships \u2014 scattered in waters from Long Beach to the San Francisco Bay \u2014 are mostly acting as floating storage for oil that\u2019s going unused as the coronavirus pandemic shutters businesses and takes drivers off the road.

Season four of\u00a0\u201cThe Crown,\u201d an award-winning drama about British royals, is already in post-production, as is \u201cOver the Moon,\u201d an animated project.\u201cWe work really far out relative to the industry,\u201d Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate moving things around.\u201dOver the past decade, Netflix has lured more than 180 million customers to its streaming service by offering a never-ending buffet of new shows. Seemingly nothing \u2014 not debt, not competition, not bad reviews \u2014 could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries.But the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as well as a movie starring\u00a0Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.With a lineup that includes\u00a0\u201cToo Hot to Handle,\u201d \u201cBlack AF\u201d and \u201cSpace Force,\u201d Netflix isn\u2019t going to run out of shows this quarter.\u00a0It also has the rights to the\u00a0Michael Jordan documentary \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last\u00a0quarter.\u201cNo one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages\u00a0and post-production) will play out,\u201d the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie \u201cKlaus,\u201d and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It\u2019s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can\u2019t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix \u201cThe Lovebirds,\u201d a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of \u201cStranger Things\u201d fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can\u2019t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What\u2019s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That\u2019s why Netflix has minimized the impact of\u00a0rival studios pulling popular programs like \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFriends.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales plunge 69% in first half of April as buyers, sellers stay home", "description": "Prices dip 1.5%, signalling market still tight", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-plunge-69-in-first-half-of-april-prices-dip?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/house-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 7:36 AM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales and listings plunged in the first part of April as the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand in Canada\u2019s largest city.Greater Toronto saw 1,654 home sales in the first 17 days of April, a 69 per cent drop from the same period a year ago.

Netflix benefited in the first quarter from an unprecedented health crisis, the global coronavirus pandemic. With billions of people stuck at home, the world\u2019s largest paid online TV network experienced an explosive jump in customers in March, with many binge-watching \u201cTiger King\u201d and \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d to ride out the quarantine.But there\u2019s no telling how long the boom will last. Netflix expects the surge to come at the expense of growth in the months ahead.\u201cOur guess is subscribers will be light\u201d in the third and fourth quarter, chief executive Reed Hastings said Tuesday on a call with investors.Netflix forecasts 7.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter \u2014 a great quarter under normal circumstances. But investors, who sent the stock to new highs this week, may have wanted more. Though they initially bid Netflix shares up as much as 12% after the close Tuesday, the rally soon fizzled. The stock was little changed as of 5:38 p.m. in New York.\u201cLike other home-entertainment services, we\u2019re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth,\u201d the company said in a letter to investors. \u201cWe expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.\u201dWhile COVID-19 has been devastating to the global economy, video-streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have found a captive audience. The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,\u201d said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter\u2019s results reflected two of Netflix\u2019s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as \u201cThe Irishman\u201d and \u201cThe Two Popes,\u201d Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. \u201cTiger King,\u201d about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since \u201cStranger Things,\u201d according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, \u201cToo Hot to Handle,\u201d has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.\u2019s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally \u2014 even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.\u201cI understand the caution around the response to the stock,\u201d Grous said, before adding, \u201cBut we\u2019re not focused too much on quarter to quarter.

The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract\u2019s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.\u201cAdditional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be \u2018lights out\u2019 as a partnership and could actually \u2018owe\u2019 money,\u201d writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product\u2019s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund\u2019s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. \u201cHowever, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,\u201d according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.\u201cThere has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,\u201d she said. \u201cUnclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we\u2019re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.\u201dIn the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called \u201cacceleration events\u201d that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "In Calgary, an epic real estate glut compounds the misery of a pandemic and oil crash", "description": "One firm projects more than 33% of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and 'a huge crater' in city finances", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/in-canadas-oil-capital-a-real-estate-glut-compounds-the-misery?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/calgary-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 9:35 AM EDT", "content": "From the outside, the roughly diamond-shaped Nexen tower is one of the more recognizable features of Calgary\u2019s skyline. On the inside, it\u2019s a barren landscape. All 37 floors are empty.Office landlords in major cities around the world are facing a hit from the coronavirus. In Canada\u2019s energy capital, they\u2019re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and \u201ca huge crater\u201d in local government finances.It\u2019s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada\u2019s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade\u2019s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market\u2019s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there\u2019s an epic glut. Net asking rents \u2014 what the landlord receives \u2014 for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America\u2019s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Four buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.\u201cThe office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,\u201d said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.Canada\u2019s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers\u2019 ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time\u201cThere was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,\u201d said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Canada. \u201cWhereas now, it\u2019s been bust for a long time.\u201d His firm sees the city\u2019s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they\u2019re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,\u201d Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn\u2019t survive or deserted their leased space.The crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil\u2019s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary\u2019s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that\u2019s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar\u2019s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.\u201cThe question is, \u2018Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?\u2019\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeremy Herron and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks tank as oil bloodbath rattles investors", "description": "The gut-wrenching oil rout may signal the hit to the global economy will be far worse than anticipated", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-drop-dollar-gains-on-north-korea-news-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/tsx-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 20, 2020 11:55 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks tumbled the most in almost three weeks and Treasury bonds rallied as turmoil in the crude oil futures market triggered a fresh bout of risk aversion.The S&P 500 fell 3.07 per cent, with equity investors shrugging off a deal reached by the White House and congressional leaders on fresh spending to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Both the numbers and the tone from the five largest U.S. lenders have underscored a view that Canadian financial services stocks \u2014 which make up almost a third of the stock market north of the border \u2014 will lag any eventual economic recovery, said Scotiabank\u2019s Sumit Malhotra. The Big Six Canadian lenders report in May.And the uncertainty surrounding global economic growth will weigh on investors\u2019 minds. While Trump has said the shared U.S.-Canada border will be one of the earliest to be released, both countries extended the restrictions for 30 days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said over the weekend \u2014 disrupting North American supply chains for an extended period. And China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, suffered a massive setback after entering its first economic contraction in decades.One place of solace: President Donald Trump issued guidelines to U.S. states to consider as they decide whether to relax stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures, sending stock markets globally soaring Friday. Governors and businesses now have to make those difficult decisions.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe", "title": "Shopify just leapfrogged Brookfield to become the third-largest company in Canada", "description": "Shares surge to a record after CTO says company is doing 'Black Friday level traffic' daily", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-surges-after-cto-touts-black-friday-level-traffic?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 17, 2020 3:29 PM EDT", "content": "A furious rally in Shopify Inc. has vaulted the e-commerce retailer to the third-largest company in Canada \u2014 underscoring the value of the virtual world in the time of the coronavirus.Shopify soared as much as 10 per cent to a record on Friday after its Chief Technology Officer Jean-Michel Lemieux said in a tweet that the Ottawa-based company was handling \u201cBlack Friday level traffic every day!\u201d as it brings \u201cthousands\u201d of businesses online.The move extended a seven-day surge to almost 50 per cent, giving it a market value of about $92 billion (US$66 billion) and making it the best-performing stock on the S&P/TSX Composite index so far this year.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.\u201dSince the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. \u201cShould someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\u201d asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. \u201cWhere exactly do we draw the line?\u201dThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predictedToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matt Day", "title": "Jeff Bezos wants regular, in-house testing of all Amazon employees for COVID-19", "description": "Bezos said company assembled team of scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build first testing lab soon", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/jeff-bezos-wants-regular-in-house-testing-of-all-amazon-employees-for-covid-19?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jeff-bezos-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 16, 2020 11:25 AM EDT", "content": "Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said the online retail giant is developing COVID-19 testing capabilities as a first step toward a system of regular checks on its employees globally.In an annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire founder outlined other steps the e-commerce giant has taken to curb the coronavirus, from shutting down non-essential services like Amazon Books to overhauling processes at Whole Foods. The next step was regular testing for all staff \u2014 including those who showed no symptoms, he said. On Thursday, Bezos said his company had assembled a team comprising scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its first testing lab soon.\u201cRegular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,\u201d Bezos said in the letter, which offers a rare window into the thinking of the world\u2019s richest man and his plans for the company he founded. Bezos in recent years has rarely done media interviews or commented publicly on events.Amazon is working to keep its e-commerce operations running as the coronavirus pandemic sickens employees and disrupts supply chains. Amid criticism that Amazon wasn\u2019t doing enough to protect workers in warehouses and on delivery routes, Bezos in March wrote to employees, thanking them for their work and predicting the outbreak \u201cwill get worse before it gets better.\u201d He subsequently donned a mask and toured a company warehouse near Dallas, where he posed for selfies with workers.Bezos also reiterated previous company announcements that Amazon has distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at facilities around the world. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company was crowding together would-be recruits at job fairs \u2014 flouting official guidelines urging people to stay at least six feet apart. In the letter, Bezos said: \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted training protocols so we don\u2019t have employees gathering in one spot, and we\u2019ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.\u201dBezos, as is his custom, included in his note a copy of his 1997 letter to shareholders. It\u2019s a way of reminding his audience that Amazon\u2019s strategy of prioritizing long-term thinking and customer satisfaction over short-term profits has paid off handsomely for investors.Last year, Bezos used his annual letter to advance an argument that Amazon\u2019s growth had benefited third-party merchants that sell on its site. The comments were widely interpreted as a rejoinder to critics who say Amazon has amassed too much market power and should be broken up.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove, Sandrine Rastello, Kait Bolongaro and Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Provinces take baby steps in coming up with plans to get people back to work", "description": "Effort likely to be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks \u2014 and it will be months, if not longer, before country runs anywhere near capacity", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-provinces-covid-19-return-work-plans?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/legault.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 10:53 AM EDT", "content": "When workers at Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. report back to work Wednesday at the LaRonde gold mine in Quebec\u2019s Abitibi region, they\u2019ll arrive in staggered groups at three separate entrances.

But with 6 million people seeking income support in the face of an unprecedented economic slump, pressure is building among the country\u2019s provinces for a return to work. The effort will likely be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks \u2014 and it will be months, if not longer, before the country is running anywhere near capacity.Quebec, the province with 52 per cent of the country\u2019s cases and 44 per cent of its deaths, took an initial step this week by making mining and home construction priority sectors, enabling their return to business. Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, has struck a cabinet committee to craft a recovery plan, while British Columbia may reveal more details this week on potential ways to consider relaxing some social-distancing restrictions.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to add a housing crisis on top of the current crisis,\u201d Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Monday during a daily press briefing, in explaining why the province has changed its mind about construction.On both sides of the border, regional governments are keen to control what reopens first and when. In Canada, provinces have control over many economic policies as well as public services from education to health. California and some of America\u2019s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has \u201ctotal\u201d authority to reopen the world\u2019s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is \u201ccoordinating\u201d his country\u2019s response.\u201cWe are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,\u201d he said a news conference in Ottawa. \u201cWe recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We\u2019re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we\u2019re going to reopen the economy. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be a while still.\u201dDiscussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillIn Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company\u2019s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company\u2019s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.\u201cWe can\u2019t be locked down forever,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThe virus will still be around us. It won\u2019t be eradicated so it\u2019s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.\u201dAny return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia\u2019s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions \u201cto get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,\u201d but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak\u2019s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.\u201cWe will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,\u201d Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back online\u201cThe services side of the business, that\u2019s harder,\u201d Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg television. \u201cYou can open your coffee shop again, but if people don\u2019t feel confident to go to it, then you\u2019re not going to see your economy come back online.\u201dAgnico-Eagle\u2019s Boyd said the return to work is strictly voluntary.

But as the COVID-19 pandemic destroys demand for crude and strips producers of cash, her most immediate challenge is to tackle the debt pile Occidental accrued last year to beat Chevron Corp. in the bidding war for Anadarko.With US$11 billion of debt due by 2022, Occidental is looking for any and all possible ways to save cash after being downgraded to junk last month. It has slashed employees\u2019 pay, reduced its regular dividend to common shareholders for the first time in 30 years and asked workers to appeal for government financial aid for the oil industry.Occidental\u2019s share registration doesn\u2019t mean Berkshire and its affiliates will necessarily sell any stock, according to the filing Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear whether Berkshire will eventually sell down its common stock stake in the oil producer, has already chipped away at that holding in recent months, or might buy more shares. Berkshire was Occidental\u2019s ninth biggest common shareholder at Dec. 31, with a 2.1 per cent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While Buffett has been known to keep some of his investments for decades, he\u2019s also been willing to trim stakes at times. Recently, his Omaha, Nebraska-based company sold some shares in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as the coronavirus ravaged the airline industry.Occidental is the second-worst performing member of the S&P 500 Energy Index since its interest in Anadarko became known a year ago, plunging 79 per cent in that span, while the index fell 51 per cent.Occidental declined 12 per cent at 11:44 a.m. in New York, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 3.1 per cent to US$19.50 a barrel.The Occidental bet was one of Buffett\u2019s largest deals in recent years and mimicked some of the famous financial crisis-era moves that allowed him to get preferred stock in companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The transaction allowed Buffett to deploy a large sum of his cash pile and accrue generous dividends.Buffett has been struggling in recent years to find attractive ways to deploy his cash, which was close to a record US$128 billion at the end of last year. The billionaire investor noted in his annual report that Occidental\u2019s dividends on his preferred stock could be paid in cash or in shares of the oil producer.Berkshire didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment sent to Buffett\u2019s assistant.

The retailer\u2019s stock climbed 5.3 per cent to a record Tuesday, lifting the founder\u2019s net worth to US$138.5 billion.The pandemic has brought the global economy to a near standstill and pushed almost 17 million Americans onto the unemployment rolls in the span of three weeks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. signalled Tuesday that loan losses fuelled by the unprecedented job cuts \u2014 many of them in the retail sector that Amazon so efficiently disrupted \u2014 could rival those incurred after the 2008 financial crisis.Yet Bezos and many of his wealthy peers have seen their fortunes recover in recent weeks, helped by the boost given to markets by unprecedented stimulus efforts by governments and central bankers. While the combined net worth of the world\u2019s 500 richest people has dropped US$553 billion this year, it has surged 20 per cent from its low on March 23, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\u201cThe wealth gap, it\u2019s only going to get wider with what\u2019s going on now,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cThe really wealthy people haven\u2019t had to worry.

Corporate insiders have been significant buyers of their companies\u2019 shares, a show of confidence that the crisis will pass, even as the nation\u2019s leaders debate exactly when Americans can safely return to work.The volume of transactions in beaten-down industries, from travel to health care to gaming, suggests executives and directors are more bullish than they\u2019ve been at most other points in the past decade, according to Sundial Capital Research.The wealth gap, it\u2019s only going to get wider with what\u2019s going on nowCarnival Corp. board member Randall Weisenburger bought US$10 million of stock in the beleaguered cruise-line operator last week. The shares have jumped 56 per cent since the purchase.Others are going further to maximize returns. UBS Group AG is seeing ultra-wealthy clients ramp up borrowing to place more wagers in what they see as a cheap market. Mortgage brokers to the rich have said more clients are seeking loans backed by real estate to help them repay other debt, invest in businesses and snap up other assets.There have been massive losers among the moneyed set. Many in the oil and gas industry have been hammered by the collapse in crude prices including wildcatter Harold Hamm, whose fortune is down 64 per cent to US$3.7 billion. Emerging-market billionaires aren\u2019t reaping the same rewards as those in the U.S. and there have been margin calls and forced sales.But there also have been remarkable gains.Leading the group is Bezos, who has added almost US$24 billion to his fortune in 2020, as well as MacKenzie Bezos, who was left with a 4 per cent stake in Amazon as part of the couple\u2019s recent divorce settlement. Her net worth has climbed US$8.2 billion to US$45.3 billion, and she\u2019s now No. 18 on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest person, and Mexico\u2019s Carlos Slim.Shares of rival retailer Walmart Inc. have also advanced, buoying the fortunes of the world\u2019s richest family. Alice, Jim and Rob Walton now have a combined net worth of US$169 billion, up almost 5 per cent since the start of the year.Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has added US$10.4 billion to his fortune this year, more than anyone except Bezos.The fortune of Zoom Video Communications Inc. founder Eric Yuan has more than doubled to US$7.4 billion, as demand for its teleconferencing service exploded in the wake of the pandemic-driven lockdown.\u201cThe unfairness of it all is who is going to benefit from it most,\u201d Maley said. \u201cMoney makes money.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks slump on warnings of the worst global recession since the 1930s", "description": "'A lot of good news has been priced in and we're due for some consolidation'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/global-markets-global-shares-dip-as-dire-warnings-for-global-economy-weigh?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/coronavirus-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 6:22 AM EDT", "content": "Stocks slumped, while Treasuries surged as bleak retail, manufacturing and homebuilding data from the world\u2019s largest economy added to concern over a severe global recession.The S&P 500 Index sank from a one-month high, with all of its major groups dropping.

The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.One thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?The central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Australia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks surge on signs coronavirus spread is easing; earnings season kicks off", "description": "Investors are now eyeing the easing of virus-related restrictions in some regions for further trading cues", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/refile-global-markets-stocks-rise-on-china-trade-data-easing-pandemic-fears?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/trade.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 4:19 PM EDT", "content": "Stocks rallied on some signs the coronavirus outbreak is either leveling off or easing, with traders assessing the first reports of the cloudy corporate earnings season.The S&P 500 jumped to a one-month high while giant technology companies pushed the Nasdaq 100 through its 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages.

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF\u2019s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries.

He reversed course last week after reaching a production agreement with the company.The medical system in the U.S. \u2014 which leads the world in infections with more than 580,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases \u2014 is grappling with shortages of protective gear for health-care professionals. Competition for crucial medical supplies is fuelling confusion and suspicions between the states and federal government over conflicting priorities.Last week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a temporary rule that would require all exports of certain masks, gloves and other materials used in the U.S.\u2019s coronavirus response to get \u201cexplicit approval\u201d from FEMA.The rule included a single exemption \u2014 for covered materials that are made by or on behalf of U.S. manufacturers with continuous export agreements with customers in other countries. And the exemption only applies if at least 80 per cent of that manufacturer\u2019s domestic production was distributed in the U.S. in the past year.Within hours of publishing that rule, FEMA and CBP representatives were flooded with emails and phone calls asking for clarity.On a conference call the agencies held last week, companies and their lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rule: What if a multinational firm ships products to one of its offices overseas because they\u2019re needed for personal protection, but not for sale? One participant noted that their shipment, addressed to a U.S. military base in the Middle East, was halted because it didn\u2019t fit the definition of the exemption under the rule, three people familiar with the call said.\u201cThis ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masks,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. \u201cBut it shows the danger of regulating trade in vital medical supplies unilaterally by anecdote rather than after careful review and consultations with key trading partners.\u201dThis ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masksThe CBP memo, dated April 9, adds that the focus of the ban is on \u201ccommercial quantities,\u201d which it defines as shipments valued at US$2,500 and containing more than 10,000 units of gloves, masks and other covered materials.A CBP spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.While the internal guidance is seen as a way to help administer the export ban, the document has not been made public, leaving exporters in the dark on any modification that may have been made to the rule.The rule reserved the right for the FEMA Administrator to establish additional exemptions \u201cthat he determines are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defence and will announce any such exemptions by notice in the Federal Register.\u201dSuch a notice has yet to be published.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jason Clenfield", "title": "Advanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs", "description": "Analyst sees 35% contraction", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/goldman-sees-advanced-economies-shrinking-35-amid-pandemic?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/coronavirus-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 6:49 AM EDT", "content": "Advanced economies will shrink about 35 per cent this quarter from the prior three months, four times as much as the previous record set in 2008 during the financial crisis, according to annualized figures from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.How fast economies will rebound is an open question because nobody knows how quickly people can get back to work, New York-based economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients dated April 13.The number of new virus cases appears to be peaking globally, but the bad news is that \u201cthe improvement is probably a direct consequence of social distancing and the plunge in economic activity, and could reverse quickly if people just went back to work,\u201d Hatzius wrote.Overall, global policy makers have mounted an impressive response to try to replace people\u2019s incomes and keep credit flowing so that households and businesses can stay afloat, but Europe should do more and wealthy countries will need to help developing economies, he wrote.\u201cThe response in Europe needs to be scaled up, via greater (and ideally centrally funded) \ufb01scal easing and a more unconditional \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 commitment to the integrity of the euro area,\u201d Hatzius wrote. \u201cEmerging economies will need a lot more help from the rich world\u201d to get through the crisis.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage relief requests ease\u00a0up as homeowners 'catch their breath' and take stock of finances", "description": "Initial demand may have been fuelled by unwarranted homeowner fears that the relief program was a 'first-come, first-serve' limited-time offer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/mortgage-relief-requests-ease-up-homeowners-catch-their-breath?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/houses.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2020 4:59 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian banks are seeing the pace of mortgage-deferral requests easing up a bit, three weeks into a program that gives homeowners a break from making payments amid the coronavirus pandemic.Almost 600,000 requests for mortgage deferrals or skipped payments have been completed or are being processed since Canada\u2019s banks announced the program on March 17, the Canadian Bankers Association said Monday.

That number will grow in the weeks ahead, as more deferral requests are processed, the association said.The federal government\u2019s $25-billion Canada Emergency Business Account has also shown strong pickup, with the country\u2019s five biggest banks approving more than 72,000 loans for small-business clients on Friday, the program\u2019s first day.

The dollar\u2019s surge has been particularly painful for countries that ran up borrowing in greenbacks and which will now struggle to cover the loans, especially as their exports tumble.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will convene by conference call on Wednesday. They are planning to offer lower income countries a freeze on bilateral government loan repayments for six or nine months or possibly into 2021, the Financial Times reported, citing an official.That fits a plan championed by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass. The World Bank in March estimated that US$14 billion in service payments are due this year.The fear is that if the emerging markets lag behind, \u201cit means more of a U-shaped or an L-shaped kind of recovery for the U.S. and global economies,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury official who\u2019s now chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.While the U.S., Europe and Japan have opened up the monetary and budgetary spigots to fight Covid-19 and its economic after-effects, many emerging economies lack the scope to do so.Morgan Stanley economists predict that emerging markets, excluding China, will shrink 4.1 per cent in the current quarter, a deeper dive than the 3.1 per cent of the first quarter of 2009 when the world was last in crisis, though shallower than what\u2019s expected in richer economies. They also estimated in an April 3 report that the peak rate of growth during the recovery for those economies will be 6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus 7.7 per cent in the same period of 2010.The problem is even more acute in the poorest nations, where many denizens can\u2019t easily practice the social distancing and regular hand washing that has become de-rigueur in rich countries.Such an environment leaves the IMF reckoning that emerging market and developing countries will need trillions of dollars in external financing to fight the virus, only part of which they can cover on their own, leaving gaps of hundreds of billions of dollars. Half of the international lending organization\u2019s 189 members are already looking to it for aid.Georgieva is trying to rally the world into a unified display of support at the Fund\u2019s semi-annual meeting, which starts Tuesday as a virtual gathering after the typical spring gathering in Washington was re-imagined.\u201cToday we are confronted with a crisis like no other,\u201d Georgieva said in an April 9 speech. \u201cThe actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery.\u201dThere are questions, though, about whether the Fund has enough to counter the crisis, especially if it proves protracted.While the IMF says it has a US$1 trillion war chest, Ted Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the maximum amount available for new lending is US$787 billion, after taking into account existing commitments and other factors. \u201cThe IMF will need more\u201d from the U.S. and the rest of the G20, he said.And it\u2019s not just the amount of resources that are at issue. It\u2019s what kind they are.The crisis has exposed a gaping hole at the center of the global economy. There\u2019s no ultimate lender of last resort who can provide the liquidity that\u2019s demanded in a financial emergency.Some $62 billion was yanked out of emerging markets in the first quarter in a global dash for cash by investors, twice the size of outflows at the peak of the world financial crisis, according to the Institute of International Finance.While there are signs that pressure is easing \u2014 Indonesia, for example, sold $4.3 billion of dollar bonds last week to help finance virus relief measures \u2014 there are risks the outflows could resume as the hit to emerging market growth becomes more evident, IIF analysts said.The Federal Reserve has moved to partly fill the void, including opening up dollar liquidity swap lines with Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Sheets said it should do the same with India, Indonesia and Chile.The IMF also has to step up and be willing to set its aside its traditional playbook for dealing with countries in trouble, in which it demands economic reforms in return for financial assistance.\u201cThis is much more of an exogenous shock,\u201d said former U.S. Treasury official Mark Sobel, now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank focused on economic policy and central banking. \u201cThere needs to be some recalibration by the IMF to provide far more liberal and fast liquidity to members.\u201dThe fund seems to be trying to do just that.It\u2019s looking at the use of precautionary short-term loans to get cash to countries, as well as other funding options like the increased use of reserve assets called special drawing rights, steps that would require the approval of rich nations.One problem with the IMF stepping up, said ex-IMF official Taimur Baig: Many countries don\u2019t like turning to the organization because they fear being tarred as a nation in trouble.\u201cDrawing on to IMF resources has an element of stigma and it is still seen as the last resort of a crisis-hit nation,\u201d said Baig, who\u2019s now chief economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.For some emerging economies with balance of payment challenges, the \u201cmore expedient\u201d currency-stabilizing measure is to draw on swap lines or repurchase agreements, as Indonesia has done, said Baig, questioning why the IMF doesn\u2019t also offer those facilities.In the 2008-09 crisis, the G-20 banded together to come up with an action plan.That\u2019s been more difficult this time for a group riven by rivalries \u2014 the U.S. and China over trade, Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil, and the U.K. and the European Union over Brexit.IIF President Tim Adams said the G-20 must rise to the occasion, nonetheless.\u201cThere will be enormous attention and enormous expectations\u201d focused on this week\u2019s gatherings, he said. \u201cNot meeting them could be detrimental for markets and for confidence.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joanna Ossinger", "title": "U.S. stocks have likely bottomed, Goldman says", "description": "A combination of unprecedented policy support and a flattening viral curve has 'dramatically' cut risks to both markets and the American economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/goldman-says-u-s-stocks-have-likely-bottomed-on-policy-support?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/nyse.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2020 9:40 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks are unlikely to make fresh lows thanks to the \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d approach of policy makers, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.A combination of unprecedented policy support and a flattening viral curve has \u201cdramatically\u201d cut risks to both markets and the American economy, strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note Monday.

Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it\u2019s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year\u2019s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.This year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple\u2019s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple\u2019s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod\u2019s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple\u2019s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Javier Blas", "title": "Donald Trump's oil deal: The inside story of how the price war ended", "description": "Fearing job losses oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/trump-oil-price-deal-inside-story?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/donald-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2020 9:05 AM EDT", "content": "After a week-long marathon of calls between world leaders and video conferences featuring dozens of energy ministers, it was the moment the 2020 oil price war finally ended.From Villahermosa, a city near Mexico\u2019s largest crude terminal, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle raised her voice. \u201cYour Royal Highness, Mexico has already agreed. And now I would like to ask you: \u2018Do you agree with these terms?\u2019\u201dIn Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. \u201cI go with the consensus. I agree,\u201d he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico\u2019s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless.\u201cWe have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,\u201d he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. \u201cI\u2019m more than happy.\u201dFor the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world\u2019s major oil producers to rein in output.We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and aliveBut the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world\u2019s biggest economies.\u201cThe OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,\u201d said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.The deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market \u2014 20 per cent of global production.Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19\u2026..For the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world\u2019s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don\u2019t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7 per cent to US$30.63 a barrel.The biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation\u2019s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He\u2019s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise.\u201cTrump views himself as a deal maker,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So \u201cTrump went to the oil market\u2019s red phone.\u201dThe president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbour\u2019s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn\u2019t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Sunday\u2019s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC\u2019s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia\u2019s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group\u2019s existing curbs at their current level.Angered by Russia\u2019s refusal to cut and Novak\u2019s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25 per cent from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it\u2019s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30 per cent in seconds \u2014 the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.What followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market\u2019s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible timeBrent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above US$70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to US$21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world\u2019s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs. Whiting Petroleum Corp., once North Dakota\u2019s biggest producer, filed for bankruptcy on April 1.As Whiting was going bust, thousands of miles in Saudi Arabia engineers at Aramco were busy pushing their oil wells to the limit.At at exactly 11.29 a.m. on March 31, the giant video wall at the company\u2019s operational nerve centre flashed total production surpassing 12 million barrels a day for the first time in history. Employees celebrated by snapping pictures, arms raised in triumph, according to photographs seen by Bloomberg News.The next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day \u2014 enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world\u2019s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be \u201cwiped out.\u201dSaudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.\u201dOf\u201cYou are waging economic warfare on Texas,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz told the Saudi ambassador in Washington in a private conference call.Recalling the conversation in a media interview afterward, Cruz said: \u201cTheir response is, \u2018But Russia. But Russia.\u2019 And I said, \u2018But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You\u2019re supposed to be our friend. And so don\u2019t screw with us.\u201dBy then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.\u201cWe see a huge oversupply in the oil market,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn\u2019t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!Brent crude jumped more than 45 per cent in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21 per cent \u2014 the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia\u2019s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America\u2019s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal\u2019s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world\u2019s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren\u2019t in its interest.\u201cTrump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. \u201cOf all the deals he\u2019s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith, Javier Blas and Salma El Wardany", "title": "Oil price war ends with historic OPEC+ deal for biggest output cut ever of 9.7 million barrels a day", "description": "The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/opec-agrees-largest-ever-oil-output-cut-of-9-7-mln-bpd-sources?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/opec-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2020 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s top oil producers pulled off a historic deal to cut global crude output and put an end to a devastating price war.After a week-long marathon of bilateral talks and four days of video conferences with government ministers from around the world, an agreement finally emerged to tackle the impact of the global pandemic on demand.The talks almost fell apart because of resistance from Mexico, but came back from the brink after a weekend of urgent diplomacy \u2014 with the clock ticking down to the market open.OPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day \u2014 just below the initial plan of 10 million. Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels \u2014 less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were \u201chorrifying.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn\u2019t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico\u2019s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20. The group, however, didn\u2019t mention any curbs in its communique following a meeting on Friday, only saying it would take measures to ensure stability.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "'Extinction-level event' looms for some cannabis companies as cash dwindles", "description": "Many companies were running low on cash and struggling to raise more before the pandemic, which only made the situation more difficult", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/cash-dwindles-extinction-level-event-looms-cannabis-weekly", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cannabis-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2020 11:03 AM EDT", "content": "Several cannabis companies are set to run out of cash in the next few months as capital markets grind to a standstill.An analysis of 33 firms tracked by trade publication Marijuana Business Daily found that eight don\u2019t have enough funding to last more than 10 months.

The total amount of capital raised by the industry fell 69 per cent in March from a month earlier as funding sources dried up, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.This has weighed on stock prices. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index fell more than 50 per cent between mid-February and its recent low on March 18, and had already lost two-thirds of its value in the 12 months before that.Based on an analysis of 1,400 consumer stocks during the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, Regan said pot stocks are likely to fall even further. In those two bear markets, valuations typically compressed 30 per cent to 50 per cent, falling to 2.4x sales or 7.5x EBITDA. While pot stocks have lost more than 50 per cent on average, many are still trading above those multiples. This is particularly true in Canada, where the average enterprise valuations are 5x sales and 11.3x EBITDA.Those that do survive will rebound sharply, but the trick will be picking the winners, he said.\u201cEven if the long-term cannabis investment thesis is intact, it\u2019s going to come down to executing on that idea to actually realize that return,\u201d Regan said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Claire Ballentine", "title": "TSX see biggest weekly gain since 2009 on Fed aid", "description": "U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly gain since 1974", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-gain-after-fed-steps-up-help-oil-gains-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 9, 2020 4:42 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly gain since 1974 as investors looked past staggering jobless numbers when the Federal Reserve released new measures to cushion the fallout from the coronavirus.

Importantly, Russia has agreed to make deep cuts, the delegates said.Oil prices pared gains, trading up 1.6 per cent in London at US$33.37 a barrel as of 4:13 p.m. local time.

And once-in-a-generation recessions don\u2019t tend to occur just a decade apart.For millennials, the timing of these events has been particularly damaging. People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been \u201cmuch larger\u201d than previous downturns.Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person\u2019s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn\u2019t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They\u2019re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, \u201cI worry even more about the people without college diplomas.\u201dWhile white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.\u201cIt could be a problem if the unemployment stops,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boesler", "title": "Federal Reserve went into crisis-fighting mode with 'forceful' policy response, minutes show", "description": "At the unscheduled meeting, officials announced they would cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero and relaunch massive bond-buying programs", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-went-into-crisis-fighting-mode-with-forceful-policy-response-minutes-show?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fed.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 8, 2020 2:29 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials went into crisis-fighting mode as they grasped the scale of the harm the coronavirus pandemic would likely do the U.S. economy.Policy makers saw risks pointing to the downside and warranting a \u201cforceful\u201d response, according to a record of their emergency gathering Sunday, March 15.\u201cAll participants viewed the near-term U.S. economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply in recent weeks and as having become profoundly uncertain,\u201d minutes published Wednesday of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed.At the unscheduled meeting, officials announced they would cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero and relaunch massive bond-buying programs to pump cash into the financial system, as they sought to shelter the U.S. economy from the coronavirus pandemic.Millions of Americans have lost their jobs over the last several week as businesses shuttered to stem the virus outbreak.

Bank of Montreal, for example, is enabling over half of its call centre staff to make the move, and has dramatically lowered the number of on-site staff in each remaining location by sending them to alternative sites, including closed branches to help maintain social distancing.At Royal Bank of Canada, 85 per cent of its call and operations centre employees in personal and commercial banking are already working from home, and the Toronto-based bank has a goal of reaching 95 per cent by early next week.Toronto-Dominion is able to shift about 350 employees in Canada and 150 in the U.S. each day, and by the end of April almost all of its 9,500 call centre staff will be working from home, aside from those with less than three months experience.\u201cThe whole business working together really made this happen: the logistics, the risk component, the technology, the deployment,\u201d Toronto-Dominion\u2019s Smith said. \u201cWe have people working every single night, all night long, every day of the week to make this happen.\u201dThe effort hasn\u2019t been without its challenges, including deploying all the laptops and monitors \u2014 nor risks.\u201cWe know that it is a little bit different working from home \u2014 we can\u2019t control everything that you can control in the office, so we had to become comfortable with the way we mitigate our risk,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat was a big obstacle that we overcame.\u201dWorking from home has been embraced by the employees, according to Smith. Workers get an extra 10 personal days to help with daycare issues and the ability to change schedules and do split shifts.When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, Toronto-Dominion expects to keep work-from-home as an option for call centre staff.\u201cThere\u2019s no telling what this is going to look like when we\u2019re all done and how people are going to feel, but I would like to continue to allow agents to work from home even after the crisis,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd that would be solely for flexibility.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "Alberta Premier Kenney sees negative oil prices, $20-billion deficit in \u2018the greatest challenge of our generation\u2019", "description": "'I cannot overstate how grave the implications of this will be for jobs, the economy, and the financial security of Albertans'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/alberta-premier-kenney-sees-negative-oil-prices-14-billion-deficit?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jason-kenney-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 8:31 PM EDT", "content": "Alberta Premier Jason Kenney says the combined toll of Covid-19 pandemic, the global economic recession and the collapse in oil prices represent the greatest challenge in the province\u2019s modern history, threatening its main industry and wreaking havoc on its finances.In a televised address on Tuesday, Kenney warned that there is a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d of negative prices for Alberta\u2019s energy products.

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201d\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201d\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201d\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201d\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost.

Then one of the bank\u2019s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: \u201cThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr\u2019s note.\u201dThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's noteMore than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan\u2019s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they\u2019re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home.\u201cWe\u2019ve stated many times that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. \u201cWe have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor\u2019s note.\u201dThose tensions aren\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It\u2019s the finance industry\u2019s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where \u201cessential\u201d workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Some investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it\u2019s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank\u2019s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn\u2019t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it\u2019s trying to be respectful of people\u2019s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.Traders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn\u2019t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked \u201cimportant\u201d last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. \u201cWe remain open,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDriving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.\u201d Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown \u2014 even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Most big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm\u2019s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor\u2019s note to work from home.Inside Natixis SA\u2019s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: \u201cHighly Confidential: COVID-19 \u2014 Staff Infection List.\u201dWorkers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.\u201cNatixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. \u201cWe have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees\u2019 health and help slow the propagation of the virus.\u201dMarket swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it\u2019s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York\u2019s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan\u2019s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank\u2019s global head of markets, \u201ccontinues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,\u201d Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna\u2019s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if they\u2019d been working from home.\u201cWith the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,\u201d Adragna wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET\u2019S GO.\u201dJPMorgan\u2019s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders\u2019 dealings. It isn\u2019t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven\u2019t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems \u201creasonably designed\u201d to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she\u2019s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she\u2019ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks surge to 3-week high on reports that coronavirus death toll is easing in hot spots", "description": "'There is light at the end of the tunnel but it's still a long tunnel'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-jump-with-u-s-futures-on-easing-virus-toll-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stocks-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 6, 2020 5:06 PM EDT", "content": "Stocks surged the most in almost two weeks after the reported death tolls in some of the world\u2019s coronavirus hot spots showed signs of easing.

That\u2019s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn\u2019t able to recover from.\u201cThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cmaking it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.\u201dThere are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company\u2019s weak revenue in the quarter \u2014 just US$7.3 million \u2014 prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges.

Storage tanks worldwide are brimming with crude as the global pandemic destroys demand, while Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a fight for market share.At one point last week, a benchmark of Canadian heavy crude tumbled as low as US$3.82 a barrel. The price of Western Canadian Select for May was US$16.25 below West Texas Intermediate Thursday, according to NE2 Group.And while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opened the government\u2019s coffers to businesses in an effort to save the Canadian economy, nothing specific has been done for the energy sector yet. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week that further relief measures, specifically for the oil and gas and airline sectors, will come in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201dThe twin shock has taken its toll on all energy producers, big and small.Canadian oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. said last week it will shut in one of its two production lines at its two-year-old, 194,000 barrel-a-day Fort Hills oil sands mine. Additionally, demand losses could see commercial inventory levels to be breached within two to three weeks if Canadian production isn\u2019t further reduced, Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this week.RBC\u2019s Pardy said Canadian oil producers will need to shut in or curtail about 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, or one-quarter to one-third of supply, in the second and third quarters of this year.\u201cWe have fielded a number of queries regarding the potential role that policymakers in Canada could play in providing energy sector support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that Shut & Swap \u2014 a conceptual arrangement aimed at revenue smoothing \u2014 could be a partial remedy.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith", "title": "Oil demand shredded by coronavirus pandemic threatens shut-ins all over the world", "description": "'It's going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oils-stunning-demand-collapse-threatens-closures-everywhere?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 3, 2020 1:34 PM EDT", "content": "The survivors of oil\u2019s last crash were the lowest-cost producers. But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don\u2019t apply.From the shale patch of Texas and the oilsands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won\u2019t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, \u201cthere could soon be no place for their oil to go.\u201dEvery imaginable space \u2014 from tanks and pipelines to rail cars \u2014 is filling to the brim. It\u2019s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that\u2019s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing.\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about who\u2019s going to shut in. It\u2019s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,\u201d Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.\u201dThe rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it\u2019ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts \u2014 in itself a mammoth undertaking \u2014the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America\u2019s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation\u2019s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is \u201chomeless,\u201d with \u201cliterally nowhere to go,\u201d consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.Production is starting to buckle everywhere.IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oilsands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.Brazil\u2019s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador, Citigroup Inc. said, \u201cisn\u2019t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.\u201dProducers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most \u201cimmune,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Currie said. Those \u201csitting behind thousands of miles of pipe\u201d are the most exposed.Russia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.Neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face \u201csevere offtake issues,\u201d said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.While logistics are critical, oil\u2019s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At US$25 a barrel crude, about 5 per cent of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.Companies are also slashing spending. BP Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about US$5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren\u2019t economical at current oil prices.\u201cIn the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,\u201d said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc.Amid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than US$10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world \u2014 from Egypt to Japan.Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil\u2019s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country\u2019s free-market ethics.But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.\u201cThe market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,\u201d said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. \u201cThat horse has left the barn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert", "title": "U.S. jobs plunge 701,000 in March, seven times what economists were expecting", "description": "First decline since 2010", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-payrolls-fall-701000-in-march-ahead-of-surge-in-layoffs", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 3, 2020 9:00 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. employment plummeted last month in the first decline since 2010, offering an initial look at the widespread devastation the coronavirus pandemic has already begun to wreak on the once-strong labour market.Payrolls fell 701,000 from the prior month \u2014 compared with the median forecast of economists for a 100,000 decline \u2014 according to Labor Department data Friday that mainly cover the early part of March, even before government-mandated shutdowns forced firms to lay off millions more workers.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201dReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dStill, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back.

He also tweeted that the cut could be up to 15 million barrels.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!At noon, Brent futures were up 19 per cent, to US$29.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose US$4.59, or 23 per cent, to $22.55. Canadian WCS surged $3.80 to $9.09. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn\u2019t spoken to the Saudi crown price and hasn\u2019t agreed to cut oil production to boost prices, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a text message.The Middle East kingdom also didn\u2019t confirm the cuts, but called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC+ producer alliance to reach a \u201cfair deal\u201d that would restore balance in oil markets, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Any curbs by the group would be conditional on other countries joining, according to a delegate.\u201cThe 10, 15 million barrel a day cut is just not going to happen. On top of that, Russia has older oil wells, so they can\u2019t restart in the same way that Saudi Arabia can,\u201d said Tariq Zahir, a fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.He added that there is a chance that the countries might agree to some sort of curb, but if there was a supply reduction of that size, it would come from inventories filling up storage, leading to economic shuts in. The move comes after oil was already climbing following China\u2019s instruction to government agencies to start buying cheap crude for its strategic reserves.Despite the U.S. president\u2019s optimism, Saudi Arabia hasn\u2019t appeared to relent on its bid to flood the market yet, saying on Wednesday it was pumping at a record and had this week loaded almost 19 million barrels of oil in a single day. Meanwhile, Russia has said it\u2019s not satisfied with the oil price.If collective action does remove 10 million barrels a day from the market, that would be the equivalent of about 10 per cent of world demand prior to the impact of coronavirus crisis.That may not be enough to stop the pain that\u2019s rippled across the energy industry as demand craters with the coronavirus outbreak shutting down economies around the world, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura. The trading house raised its consumption-loss estimate to around 35 million barrels a day.\u201cWe have no hope of production cuts matching the demand destruction,\u201d he told Bloomberg, adding that by the middle to late April, \u201coil will have come out of the ground and will struggle to find a home.\u201dThat view is consistent with a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note earlier this week, citing that any conceivable oil production cut by the U.S., OPEC+ and Canada would still \u201cfall well short\u201d of its estimated 26 million barrels a day of demand loss and only provide \u201cfleeting support to inland crude prices.\u201dMeanwhile, the physical crude market continues to show deepening signs of strain.Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world\u2019s physical supply, was assessed at $15.135 on Wednesday, the lowest since at least 1999.

As many as 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s 6,000 oil explorers eventually may go under, according to Mizuho Securites USA LLC analyst Paul Sankey, as the twin blows of Covid-19 and a Russia-Saudi price war destroy producers like Whiting.Once the largest oil producer in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale region, Whiting lost money in four of the last five years and spiralled deeper into debt just as the COVID-19 outbreak crushed energy demand. The company\u2019s Bakken primacy won it little praise because the region was already falling out of favour as drillers shifted to lower-cost prospects in the Permian Basin.Touted as one of the \u201ccomeback kids\u201d of U.S. shale by Canaccord Genuity in late 2015, Whiting said Wednesday that it\u2019s agreed to hand most of its ownership to noteholders in exchange for erasing more than US$2.2 billion in debt, according to a statement.As many as 40 per cent of U.S. oil and gas companies could crater into bankruptcy or distress over the next two years as they grapple with a market crash and the coronavirus outbreak, according to asset manager Pickering Energy Partners LP.Shale drillers aren\u2019t the sole sub sector clobbered by the crash. Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc., which specializes in hauling gear to offshore drilling sites and production platforms, disclosed Wednesday that it\u2019s negotiating a plan with creditors to ease a US$1.2 billion debt burden. The company is planning a Chapter 11 filing.On Wednesday, Denver-based Whiting faced the maturity of US$262 million in convertible-notes . Whiting filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the Southern District of Texas, listing debt of US$3.6 billion and assets worth US$7.6 billion in its bankruptcy petition.Even before the viral pandemic sent crude prices tumbling to the lowest in almost two decades, Whiting was struggling and never fully recovered from the last market crash of 2014-2016. In December 2015, as crude prices were just weeks from dipping to a 13-year low, Canaccord analyst Stephen Berman listed Whiting among a group of potential \u201ccomeback kids\u201d in the U.S. shale industry.When former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executive Brad Holly took the reins as Whiting\u2019s chief in late 2017, oil prices were rising and at one point breached US$75 a barrel. But the debt load remained stubbornly high, prompting Holly last year to fire one-third of his workforce and scale back production targets after posting an unexpected quarterly loss.Oil now trades around US$20 a barrel, well below the US$50 level that Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum estimates Whiting requires to stay afloat. The company, which had a market capitalization of US$11 billion in 2014, was valued at about US$62 million as of Tuesday. Whiting\u2019s bankruptcy filing followed that of shale drillers Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Sanchez Energy Corp., which sought protection last year.Moelis & Co. is Whiting\u2019s financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser and Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser.The case is Whiting Petroleum Corporation, 20-32021, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from coronavirus, job posting data suggests", "description": "Postings in Canada down 24%, while only 15% in U.S.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hiring-in-canada-drops-more-than-u-s-job-postings-data-show?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/montreal.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 1, 2020 8:20 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from the pandemic, according to a report by Indeed.com.Postings in Canada for the week ended March 27 were down 24 per cent from the same time last year, the job board website said in a report on Tuesday.

The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Typical five-year fixed rates at also rising.

Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told President Donald Trump\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the automaker might be able to help make much-needed ventilators, the scarce breathing machines used to keep coronavirus patients alive.The deal would help the company, which has had tense relations with Trump. It would help the administration, which faced charges that the pandemic caught it napping. Most importantly, it would help the sickest patients, those facing death without machines to breathe for them.But not 10 days later, Trump accused GM of foot-dragging and price-gouging in its effort to replenish the supply of medical equipment. \u201cAlways a mess with Mary B,\u201d Trump tweeted, hours before invoking the Defense Production Act, which allowed him to order GM to move.As usual with \u201cthis\u201d General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, \u201cvery quickly\u201d. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke \u201cP\u201d.Newly revealed details show that GM has been continuously engaged in the effort \u2014 order or no order \u2014 and company officials say the sprint from first phone call to production will take about a month. A parallel effort by Ford Motor Co. isn\u2019t expected to bear fruit until June, though the company has said it\u2019s speeding up its work. Trump did an about-face Sunday, saying GM is doing a \u201cfantastic job.\u201dEven as Trump was excoriating GM on Friday, the automaker and its Seattle-area partner, Ventec Life Systems Inc., were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN: ventilator, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulizer. When they start in mid-April, it will culminate a lightning-fast effort to convert an auto-parts plant into a medical-equipment complex.\u201cThe speed has been challenging,\u201d Gerald Johnson, GM\u2019s global vice president of manufacturing, said in a Sunday evening interview. \u201cBut we know it will save thousands of lives. Making cars is cool, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what we\u2019re doing.\u201dTrump\u2019s criticism of GM boiled down to the company asking the federal government to \u201cshow me the the money\u201d before it would put the venture into high gear, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. In initial discussions with the administration, GM and its partner were seeking about US$250 million for Ventec and its components suppliers to get production moving. The government wanted to contribute a fraction of that, people familiar with the deliberations said.\u201cYou can\u2019t get to the finish line unless you first go to the starting gate,\u201d Navarro, who was appointed last week to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, said in an email to Bloomberg News.The sprint started with exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called Stop the Spread. It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to COVID-19. The group is led by retired American Express Co. Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson, founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc.Making cars is cool, but it doesn't compare to what we're doingThey asked Barra\u2019s team what they needed to make ventilators. GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force.For his part, Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise, factories and a workforce to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals.Managers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help Ventec go from building a maximum of 250 ventilators a month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year. The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year. It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic\u2019s early weeks.\u201cThey produce millions of cars a year in the U.S.,\u201d Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks said of GM. \u201cWe produce hundreds of ventilators a month. They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale.\u201dThe next day, Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in. Kudlow, one of the administration\u2019s primary pitchmen, floated the idea on television. He cited GM as an example of a company that was stepping up \u201con a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.\u201dBut GM was still studying how to make it happen. On March 19, Phil Kinley, vice president of manufacturing and labour and the plant-floor leader of the project, flew with engineers to Ventec\u2019s site in Washington, Johnson said. Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator\u2019s 700 parts to GM\u2019s Tech Center in Warren, north of Detroit.GM\u2019s purchasing team went to work, Johnson said. They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows to wipers. They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses. By March 22, GM had most parts lined up.\u201cThe supply base really stepped up,\u201d Johnson said.The VOCSN, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017, is primarily used for critical-care ventilation. It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient, and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs, secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep the patient\u2019s chest clear.The company boasts on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment. To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven, a GM assembly plant was ill suited. The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of a Buick. Making a ventilator is more like building a watch: Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs.That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines.The facility has 300 on staff and will need 1,000 to achieve the production levels GM and Ventec want to reach. The carmaker has started evaluating new hires and is seeking volunteers among the staff idled by the shutdown of parts production in Kokomo and metal stamping in nearby Marion, Indiana.GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process, Johnson said.\u201cThis is truly a major step at a critical moment,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime watcher of Detroit\u2019s automakers. \u201cGM was written off and appears to be coming through.\u201dGM and Ventec now need to decide how the units will be distributed and paid for. Negotiations continue with the government, which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to people familiar with the matter.That assumes a deal gets done. To the surprise of GM and Ventec, Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing. He tweeted that GM officials \u201cwant top dollar.\u201dGM said it\u2019s building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec, which is the major player in negotiations with the government. The machines normally cost about US$18,000 apiece, while some ventilators can run as high as US$50,000.Another benefit of Ventec\u2019s VOCSN is it replaces four other pieces of hardware typically needed for acute respiratory care. Using it could lower costs for hospitals because they won\u2019t need to buy oxygenators, nebulizers and devices to clear the lungs.When Trump complained last week about pricing, people in the GM-Ventec venture thought that the device\u2019s five-in-one therapy capabilities may not have been completely understood. People familiar with negotiations said there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline, and they were caught off guard when the president complained.As negotiations go on, GM and Ventec say they are progressing fast. \u201cThe responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need,\u201d Brooks said.There\u2019s already been a change in sentiment from Trump. At his press briefing on Sunday, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have to worry about General Motors now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello, Jacqueline Thorpe, Kevin Orland and Danielle Bochove", "title": "Scenes from a shutdown: How Canadian workers are facing the COVID-19 slump", "description": "From Calgary to Montreal, here are their tales", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-workers-covid-19-shutdown-impact", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-courier.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "They\u2019d just bet millions on a hotel makeover, were waiting tables while pursuing their dream, or toiling in an already tough oil market.Canadians have seen their world upended in a matter of days as the coronavirus shuts down huge swaths of the economy.

The group drew a line at 349 people and raised $41,500 on its GoFundMe page over a few days, but emails keep coming in.\u201cWe have some really heartbreaking pleas for help,\u201d said Jessica Cytryn, one of the organizers. \u201cOne of our members word-searched our emails to find people who said that they hadn\u2019t eaten in a few days and went out and bought food, and brought it to their homes.\u201dApplicants to the fund include Robin Wattie, a 36-year-old musician who saw her European tour canceled and lost her bar tending and waitressing jobs. She\u2019s awaiting a response to her application for unemployment benefits but worries she should have filed for provincial assistance instead.For now she makes do with a tiny cash stash and her credit card, and plans to ask for a new income replacement announced last week by Trudeau that gives $2,000 a month.\u201cIt\u2019s like this big stressful puzzle,\u201d she said.Paul Poscente has been getting calls every hour from his oil and gas clients, cancelling projects.His company, Backwoods Energy Services, provides a variety of services, including clearing timber and brush from work sites and building access roads and bridges. He\u2019s now expecting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent decline in business as Alberta takes the hit from the Russian-Saudi oil price war. Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta. It employs about 300 workers from the community, and its $140 million in annual revenue provides its largest independent source of funds.\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m doing a disservice to my family,\u201d Poscente said. \u201cIt\u2019s materially devastating to the community, and it feels personal.\u201dStill, Poscente, 57, said the company has grown with an \u201cultra-conservative\u201d balance sheet since he took over as CEO in 2015 and expects it to withstand the economic troubles better than most competitors.Flight attendant Max Audet got notice a week ago he\u2019d be laid off from Air Canada Rouge on April 3.\u201cThe main thing on my mind is that I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to be for,\u201d said Audet, 28, who is also a rep for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents flight attendants. \u201cIt really adds to the stress.\u201dAudet has immediately cut back. He\u2019s reduced automatic savings to his retirement account for his final paycheques and is being careful what he buys at the grocery store. He takes comfort from the fact that with five years under his belt, he\u2019s still senior to 62 per cent of Air Canada staff, thanks to a big hiring spree at the airline in recent years.\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about the lasting impact it will have on airlines,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we see people doing less travel, which could definitely affect staffing levels over time?\u201dOutside the Church of the Redeemer on Toronto\u2019s Mink Mile, one of Canada\u2019s ritziest shopping districts, the drop-in lunch program had plenty of customers.On a normal day, The Common Table provides about 80 lunches to the city\u2019s must vulnerable residents, but with similar programs closing, the number has spiked.\u201cThere\u2019s a good 20 per cent increase in the last few days,\u201d Justin Laflemme, a church custodian who helps out at the program, said. \u201cI spent a couple of years on the street as well so I recognize the faces and they\u2019re not regulars of our program.\u201dAs the virus spreads, he expects things to get worse.\u201cIt can happen overnight for some people,\u201d Laflemme said of the slide into homelessness. \u201cIt depends on their circumstances, what level of nest egg they have and what their income is.

The U.S. president spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 9 about the dispute.Trump has long argued that improving relations between Washington and Moscow could help solve international disputes. The president said he wanted to discuss trade with Putin, though he said he expected the Russian president to raise objections to U.S. sanctions. State-run Tass quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin didn\u2019t ask Trump for sanctions relief on the call.Oil tumbled earlier to its lowest point in nearly two decades, heading for the worst quarter on record as coronavirus lockdowns cascaded through the world\u2019s largest economies, leaving the market overwhelmed by cratering demand and a ballooning surplus. The slump in demand has shut refineries from South Africa to Canada.I never thought I'd be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so lowGoldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates consumption will drop by 26 million barrels a day this week. Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months, despite U.S. warnings against flooding the market.Some analysts argue Russia\u2019s motivations extend well beyond oil and are complicated by the federation\u2019s anger over U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia to Germany. And the price for getting Russia to back down could be too high.\u201cRussia\u2019s concerns with the U.S. go beyond market share. Putin is frustrated with sanctions and may be more interested in punishing the U.S. than Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and chief executive of drilling services company Canary LLC. \u201cIf Trump wants an agreement with Putin, he may have to promise to ease up on sanctions. I am not sure he can deliver without the backing of congress.\u201dRosneft PJSC over the weekend sold its assets in Venezuela to the Russian government, a move that shields the Russian oil giant from further U.S. sanctions while keeping Moscow behind the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Fears of broader sanctions have grown after the U.S. in recent months slapped restrictions on Rosneft trading companies for handling business with Venezuela.Talks between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies broke down in early March as Russia refused to sign on to larger production cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia. The failure to reach an agreement prompted the Saudis to unleash a price war which, combined with the devastating effect of the virus pandemic, caused the market to crash.Global demand is slumping by as much as 20 million barrels a day, about 20 per cent, as billions of people go into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The outlook remains dire, with traders, banks and analysts forecasting a huge oversupply as governments effectively shut their economies.Oil industry leaders, trade groups and some Republican senators have pressed the Trump administration to seek a diplomatic solution with Saudi Arabia. Six senators from oil-producing states last week urged Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia, while highlighting several \u201cpowerful tools at our disposal,\u201d including sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.\u201cTrump would have better success pressing Saudi Arabia than Russia since they are dependent on the U.S. for protection, intelligence and arms sales,\u201d Eberhart said.On the coronavirus, the two sides expressed concern about the scale of its spread, according to the Kremlin.

Measures to slow the spread of coronavirus may result in an unprecedented plunge in fuel demand, with estimates that global consumption is shrinking by 20 per cent or more.U.S. government data show that the amount of refined products supplied to the market fell by more than 2 million barrels a day in the week ended March 20. With coronavirus cases in the U.S. on the rise since then, and more parts of the country shutting down businesses and limiting travel, consumption has likely slid further.Valero Energy Corp. has reduced processing rates across about half of its refineries, and Phillips 66 said many of its refineries are near minimum rates.

Refineries are starting to shut down because nobody needs the fuels they produce. In physical oil markets, barrels are already changing hands for less than US$10, and in a few landlocked markets producers are paying consumers to take away their crude.\u201cThe physical oil market has seized up,\u201d said Gary Ross, an influential oil watcher and chief investment officer of Black Gold Investors LLC. \u201cThe logistics are struggling to cope because we are facing a catastrophic loss of demand.\u201dOil traders say it\u2019s likely to get worse this week.The root cause is an accelerating plunge in consumption that\u2019s without precedent since a steady flow of oil became essential to the global economy more than a century ago. The great crash of 1929, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the global financial crisis don\u2019t come close. The world normally uses 100 million barrels of oil day, and traders and analysts reckon as much as a quarter of that has disappeared in just a few weeks.The global airline industry is grounded, countless businesses and factories are shuttered and billions of people have been forced to stay home.\u201cDemand clearly is off, in some parts of the world, very dramatically,\u201d Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV.The immediate problem is a lack of storage in the right places. With demand running 20 million barrels a day below supply, the world won\u2019t have enough tanks to store the surplus in two or three months. But the issue is even more pressing because global tank capacity, mostly concentrated in a few hubs like Rotterdam, the Caribbean and Singapore, isn\u2019t available to every producer. For those without access to pipelines and ports, local storage will run out in days, traders and consultants say.For those with access to the coast, one solution is to use the supertanker fleet as floating storage tanks, and that\u2019s happening at an unprecedented rate. The CEO of the world\u2019s largest tanker owner, Frontline Ltd., said on Friday that he\u2019d never known such demand to hire ships for long-term storage. Traders could put 100 million barrels at sea, he estimated, but even that accounts for just a few days\u2019 oversupply.In the U.S., one of the largest pipeline companies, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has asked oil producers to voluntarily cut output to avoid overwhelming the network that connects well heads to refineries through thousands of miles of pipelines.The world is running out of places to put oil because the shutdown of vast swathes of the economy has been catastrophic for demand. The collapse in commercial air travel has cut jet fuel use by up to 75 per cent, or almost 5 million barrels a day.As for gasoline, American drivers are the single biggest source of demand, using more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. As whole states, including California and New York, have told people to stay home, billions of car journeys have been lost. It\u2019s a pattern repeated in Europe and Asia.\u201cDemand destruction is unprecedented,\u201d said Ben Luckock, co-head of trading at Trafigura Group, the second-largest independent oil trader. He estimates the hit to consumption will total 22 million barrels a day in April.We are facing a catastrophic loss of demandAround the world, about 700 refineries turn crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. They are starting to dial down production and even shut outright because demand for the fuel they produce is so dire. In India, for example, where 1.3 billion people are under lockdown until mid-Aptil, the nation\u2019s biggest refinery has cut processing rates at most plants by as much as 30 per cent.A small refiner in Italy, the epicentre of Europe\u2019s virus outbreak, shut on Friday because demand for fuel plunged 85 per cent.As the refining system withers, the crude oil market is suffering. Many crudes, especially sticky, sulfurous grades that refiners find hard to process, trade at hefty discounts to international benchmarks. Western Canadian Select, a tarry blend squeezed from Alberta\u2019s oilsands, reached a record low of US$4.51 a barrel on Friday.In the U.S., Oklahoma Sour is changing hands at US$5.75, Nebraska Intermediate at US$8, while Wyoming Sweet prices at US$3 a barrel.In one obscure corner of the American crude market, prices have already turned negative. Wyoming Asphalt Sour, a dense oil used mostly to produce paving bitumen, was bid at minus 19 cents a barrel in mid-March by Trading Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.The surprise, perhaps, is that benchmark futures are still trading as high as they are. Brent, the North Sea grade that sets the price for about two-thirds of the world\u2019s oil, ended last week at US$24.93 a barrel, well above the historic low of US$9.55 a barrel in 1998.Luckock at Trafigura says future prices are likely to fall another US$10. Black Gold\u2019s Ross also says Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will be trading in the teens within days.The next stage of the oil market\u2019s meltdown will be widespread production shutdowns as drillers decide the only option is to leave it in the ground until better days return. There are signs this is starting to happen.Brazil\u2019s state oil company Petrobras has announced it will reduce output by 100,000 barrels a day this year because of the lack of demand. In Canada, some producers have shut down output, and Glencore Plc., the world\u2019s largest commodity trading house, has shut down its production in Chad.Many producers are reluctant to shut wells because even though they\u2019re losing money at today\u2019s prices, some cashflow is often better than none at all. But as more refineries idle, the pipeline system grinds to a halt and storage tanks fill to the brim, they will soon have no choice.\u201cThe problem is no one wants to be the first to shut-in,\u201d Black Gold\u2019s Ross said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Alternative Lenders Halt Redemptions, Signaling Mortgage Cracks", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Some of Canada\u2019s biggest non-bank commercial mortgage lenders are freezing redemptions as investors try to flee the asset class.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/alternative-lenders-halt-redemptions-signaling-mortgage-cracks", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 27, 2020 6:13 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Some of Canada\u2019s biggest non-bank commercial mortgage lenders are freezing redemptions as investors try to flee the asset class.Firms including Vancouver-based Trez Capital have gated open-ended funds indefinitely as the underlying assets can\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals.While many managers of such funds have built up large cash buffers, a wider lack of liquidity in the asset management industry is emerging as a key risk for investors.\u201cWith the turmoil in the market we had a certain number of retail clients that came through with a fair number of redemptions, particularly in the last week,\u201d Daniel Marchand, senior vice-president who oversees capital raising for Trez, said from Toronto.The firm manages C$3.8 billion ($2.7 billion) that\u2019s roughly split between the U.S. and Canada.

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic.

The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures.

A handful of experts is saying that will happen again.The comeback trail would be steep and long. The spread of coronavirus is crushing demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia are creating a glut. Everybody agrees U.S. production will take a bigger hit than last time, when it dipped before soaring. As many as 70% of the 6,000 shale drillers may go bankrupt, and one-third of shale-patch workers are expected to lose their jobs. Wall Street, which financed the last boom, has cut off the cash spigot.But some experts are saying the future, however far off, will be better. They\u2019re looking past the dire forecasts and vertical chart lines and cautioning against despair. They\u2019re echoing a widespread view that\u2019s mostly unspoken during the market meltdown: Yes, America can shock the world again. The boom-and-bust cycle will shift, and shale is in a position, with its infrastructure, its ability to ramp-up quickly and its plentiful reserves, to rise from the ashes stronger than ever.When the dust settles in the Permian Basin and other American shale fields, the survivors will be leaner and more tech savvy, according to Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit Ltd. That means lower production costs and a greater ability to respond to the next price rebound with the last thing Moscow and Riyadh want \u2014 another boom.\u201cCompanies go bankrupt, but rocks don\u2019t go bankrupt,\u201d Yergin said in an interview. \u201cWhen this all shakes out, there will be other people to develop shale.\u201dNoah Barrett also believes the growth engine of U.S. crude production will be humbled, but won\u2019t flicker out. That\u2019s because shale has extensive infrastructure that isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201cThe resource is still there, the pipeline capacity, the processing capacity,\u201d said Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. \u201cThose are still there.\u201dEven if predictions are correct, that overall American oil output will slide to 8 million or 9 million barrels a day, down about one-third from the current 13 million, the U.S. would still count among the world\u2019s very top producers, Barrett said.Bloomberg Intelligence is forecasting a more-modest production falloff of about 1.5 million barrels a day.The weakest companies \u201cwill go into stronger hands,\u201d said Vincent G. Piazza, BI\u2019s senior oil analyst. \u201cThe industry is going to be in a lot better shape than in 2014-2016. The balance sheet is in a lot better shape. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the ability of this industry to re-create itself.\u201dFereidun Fesharaki is a shale believer, too. The chairman of global energy consultant FGE said he also expects the price squeeze to force explorers to become more efficient and cost-competitive.Still, any rays of optimism must penetrate a very dense, dark cloud. In the market cataclysm that\u2019s still unfolding, crude and fuel prices around the world have sunk to levels not seen in nearly two decades.As if by evil magic, the Covid-19 outbreak has chased tens of millions of people from streets, stores, factories and travel hubs, suddenly degrading demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel across the world\u2019s largest economies.Veteran crude analyst Roger Diwan expects global consumption to plunge by more than 14 million barrels a day \u2014 the biggest demand shock since the birth of the oil age. The pipeline that hauls 60% of the East Coast\u2019s gasoline supply from the Gulf Coast is cutting capacity by one-fifth. In Chicago, wholesale gasoline tumbled to 15 cents a gallon, the lowest since at least 1992.The virus-driven calamity has been compounded by the disintegration earlier this month of the Russia-Saudi cooperation pact that capped global crude supplies. Because of the rapidly expanding worldwide glut of crude, a barrel of oil in some parts of Texas recently fetched about $16. In Canada, oil traded for less than $10.The price plunge instantly made thousands of prospective shale sites money-losing propositions. Companies have been in such a hurry to cut losses that some have paid early-termination penalties on rigs and other gear to halt work before contracts are up.Slashing SpendingEven Chevron Corp. is retrenching. The California giant, widely recognized as holding some of the richest acreage in the Permian, said Tuesday it was slashing spending by $4 billion and halting share buybacks to conserve cash.In the final three months of 2019, nine explorers and six service companies filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone LLC. That represented $13.5 billion in debt. This year\u2019s churn is just getting started. Mizuho Securities analyst Paul Sankey expects as many as 70% of the 6,000 or so shale drillers to go bankrupt before the cycle turns.But private-equity firms that swooped in to buy ailing explorers and tempting assets during the last bust won\u2019t be able to unfurl a safety net this time. The buy-and-flip model that underpinned their foray into shale has disappeared, forcing those firms to become oilfield operators, which in turn means tapping their own credit facilities, said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy Group, the biggest owner of non-operated U.S. shale assets.Only about one-third of the Permian and other U.S. fields count as sweet spots that can harvest oil profitably at $30 a barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate traded at $21.42 on Friday.\u201cPrivate equity\u2019s going to be out of the game,\u201d Rainbolt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tough fund-raising market.\u201dIn the meantime, service providers \u2014 the hired hands of the oil industry who do everything from stack steel pipes to frack wells \u2014 will experience extreme pressure, along with the explorers who are demanding price cuts, said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, an indexing and research company. Pipeline owners are somewhat insulated because oil and natural gas still need to be shipped to refiners and export terminals, she said.Shale Threshold\u201cThe market is going to be out of balance for quite some time,\u201d Morris said.Yergin, the confidante of oil ministers and chief executives, sees the threshold for reinvigorating shale between $50 and $60 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading above the $50 level as recently as Feb. 26.\u201cAt $50, we\u2019ll start to see a recovery and a step up in investment, so long as people feel safe about the price floor beneath them,\u201d he said.It\u2019s funny that Yergin should put it that way. A big part of shale\u2019s resilience lies in its unique geology. Unlike the so-called conventional fields in Saudi Arabia and Russia, North American shale is rock so dense that it doesn\u2019t degrade or collapse on itself if oil production is interrupted. In other parts of the world, disrupting output can do irreversible damage.That\u2019s why the bulk of Chevron\u2019s $4 billion spending cut will take place in the Permian, CEO Mike Wirth said Tuesday. It\u2019s a rare field where production can be turned off almost instantly without adverse long-term impacts.With shale, \u201cthe assets don\u2019t go away because you haven\u2019t destroyed the field,\u201d said Ken Medlock, senior director of Rice University\u2019s Center for Energy Studies. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a thinning of the herd but the assets will still be there.\u201d\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada cuts rate for third time to 0.25% in bid to shield economy from coronavirus fallout", "description": "The last time the rate was this low was the global financial crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/breaking-bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-emergency-move?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/boc-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 27, 2020 11:15 AM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks and announced plans to acquire more commercial paper and government securities to help shield the nation\u2019s economy from coronavirus fallout.The central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound. The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history.Policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz announced two new programs: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program and the buying of Canadian government securities in the secondary market. The government securities purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve, the bank said in its statement.As the spreading coronavirus outbreak paralyzes economies globally, the energy-heavy Canadian economy is also having to contend with the crash in oil prices \u2014 prompting a steady drumbeat of recession calls.The move by the central bank is part of a wave of policy rate cuts and brings Canada\u2019s benchmark rate closer to most other advanced industrialized economies. The Bank of Canada has now lowered interest rates three times this month, with a cumulative easing of 1.5 percentage points.The Federal Reserve has also cut by 150 basis points this month.

The small Kansas plant in the heart of rural America was offering just $1.75 a barrel for Wyoming sweet crude.With more than two billion people on virus lockdown from India to California, energy demand has plunged. In corners of the U.S., Canada, Russia and China, oil prices at the well-head are collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented glut.And with it, the industry is bracing for something that last happened on this scale 35 years ago: producers shutting down their wells as pumping crude makes no economic sense.\u201cI have never seen anything like this in the markets,\u201d said Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder of Gunvor Group Ltd., a large commodity trading house. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything even close to today.\u201dThe oil market \u2014 hit by the double blow of a demand slump and a supply surge as Saudi Arabia and Russia wage a price war \u2014 is battling a surplus of as much as 20% of global consumption.The consequences are brutal: prices are now low enough to force a widespread suspension of production, or a shut-in as it\u2019s known in the industry. For those waging the price war, it counts as a victory \u2014 as long as the shut-ins happen elsewhere.Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarks closely followed in Wall Street, are hovering around $25 a barrel. But in the world of physical oil \u2014 where actual barrels change hands \u2014 producers are getting much less.The industry is navigating what Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst at Mizuho Bank Ltd, described as \u201cuncharted waters to unknown lands.\u201dWyoming Sweet, a landlocked crude with few outlets other than American refineries like Coffeyville, is paradigmatic of how the dynamics of the oil market are forcing output cuts. There are others: North Dakota Light Sweet has traded at $9.97 a barrel. Across the border, Western Canadian Select has plunged to $6.45. In Siberia, Russian crude has changed hands for less than $10 and Chinese domestic prices have fallen to single digits.Ultra-low oil prices are starting to work: Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run producer, is cutting output by 100,000 barrels a day from high-cost offshore platforms. Glencore Plc., the commodity giant, is shutting down its oilfields in Chad. In Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. has partially shutdown its Fort Hills oil sands mine.As the pain spreads, industry executives believe many other companies will stem production in the next few days.\u201cWe need to cut crude supply by 10 million barrels a day pretty quickly,\u201d said Russel Hardy, the head of top independent oil trader Vitol Group. \u201cOil prices will need to go lower, to bring the prices to a level that triggers a response.\u201dThe last time the oil industry faced widespread shut-ins was in 1986, when Saudi Arabia also ravaged the market in a price war. During the price battles of 1998-99 and 2015-16 the industry also saw cuts, but not on a large scale.Put simply, the world cannot continue pumping at the current level of about 100 million barrels a day while demand is as much as 20% lower. The surplus would overwhelm storage capacity within weeks.In some emerging markets, where infrastructure is less developed, it\u2019s already happening. Pakistan has told refiners to stop importing gasoline and diesel as the tanks are already brimming.Rush to SeaWhere there\u2019s access to the sea, traders use tankers to store oil \u2014 and wait for prices to go up. Crude is now moving onto ships at a record pace, according to one of the industry\u2019s largest shipowners.But inland, producers are reliant on sending crude to local refineries like Coffeyville and the lack of storage capacity will be decisive.\u201cThe surge in inventory in coming weeks will inevitably saturate local infrastructure, in our view, forcing many inland producers to shut-in wells,\u201d said Damien Courvalin, oil analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Some producers will prefer to take the hit of negative prices \u2014 paying someone to take the oil off their hands \u2014 to the long-term costs of shutting down a well. In the aftermath of the last major downturn, a North Dakota sour crude went to a negative 50 cents.But as storage fills up, production will have to respond. IHS Markit Ltd., a consultant, estimates the Canadian province of Alberta has inland tanks able to store the equivalent of just 3.2 days of daily production. The central U.S., which includes Wyoming, has room for just 12.8 days\u2019 output.\u201cProduction is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit. \u201cIt is now a matter of where and by how much.\u201d\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kait Bolongaro, Doug Alexander and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Trudeau, banks in talks on relief package for small business", "description": "The Finance department has been in talks with Canadian lenders this week on a plan to provide emergency help for small businesses", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-banks-in-talks-on-relief-package-for-small-business", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 6:52 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s finance department is working with the nation\u2019s banks on a relief package for small business, according to people familiar with the talks.The department has been in talks with Canadian lenders this week on a plan to provide emergency help for small businesses that have been hurt by shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing the government\u2019s plans.So far, Ottawa has made $10 billion in credit available as well as a wage subsidy to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll.The credit package was announced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on March 13, but since then the economy has deteriorated.

On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full.

Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.Toronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.The Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's big banks have already fielded 213,000 requests for mortgage deferrals", "description": "Banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadas-big-banks-field-213000-requests-for-mortgage-deferrals?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/banks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 10:28 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s biggest banks have fielded hundreds of thousands of requests from homeowners seeking to hold off making mortgage payments under a new coronavirus-related relief plan.More than 213,000 requests to defer payments have been completed or are being processed since the country\u2019s six largest banks announced the plan last week, Mathieu Labreche, a spokesman for the Canadian Bankers Association, said Thursday in an interview.\u201cThe large number of customers that have been helped continues to grow as the result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, contact-centre agents and operations teams working diligently,\u201d he said.Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced.

According to the complaint, RBC said the REIT\u2019s commercial mortgage-backed securities have \u201cdrastically declined\u201d in value due to the crisis, allowing the bank to demand additional cash or securities to meet requirements.But the trust says the calls are entirely subjective and don\u2019t actually reflect the true value of the CMBS. While many other banks have agreed not to pursue remedies against mortgage real estate investment trusts, RBC has refused \u2014 and planned to hold an auction Wednesday that included US$11 million of the trust\u2019s assets, the lawsuit says.RBC declined to comment on the lawsuit.The coronavirus is wreaking havoc in the US$16-trillion U.S. mortgage market, which is suffering its worst turmoil in more than a decade.

It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.For individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury.

It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation\u2019s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire.

Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.\u201cThis is not a slush-fund,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market.

That campaign would end about March 31.The discussions centred on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who\u2019s sick so healthy people can return to work.

This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government\u2019s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House\u2019s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump\u2019s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts.

Trudeau\u2019s government has announced an aid package worth $82 billion (US$57 billion), which is mostly temporary tax deferrals. The Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by a full percentage point, but still has its benchmark above other countries.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have everybody filing for claims but if they have no job to go back to, it\u2019s going to compound things,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jack Sidders and Lucca de Paoli", "title": "London Property Sale Worth $500 Million Collapses in Virus Havoc", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\u2019s planned sale of its 50% stake in the 900 million pound ($1.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/london-property-sale-worth-500-million-collapses-in-virus-havoc", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 20, 2020 3:23 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\u2019s planned sale of its 50% stake in the 900 million pound ($1.05 billion) Nova development in London\u2019s Victoria district has collapsed as coronavirus roils global real estate markets.Singapore-based ARA Asset Management Ltd., which was lined up to purchase the pension fund\u2019s half of Nova, will no longer carry out the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.A spokesman for CPPIB declined to comment.

The shutdowns are contributing to the growing conviction that the world has slipped into its first recession since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.\u201cThis is kind of a rolling natural disaster,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. \u201cIn terms of the impact on global production, the shutdown outside of China will likely become bigger than the impact from China.\u201dThe shock to supply chains, Harris said, is deeper and more sprawling than the trade wars of the past two years and likely to be more prolonged than the storms, earthquakes or floods that have been a source of stress for major industries in the past. He expects factory shutdowns will last into May and possibly longer.Compounding the blow for companies, the initial supply shock has become interwoven with a demand crisis in Europe, the U.S. and other major economies as workers and consumers are ordered to stay home.Apple SuppliersApple Inc., for example, is confronting the impact on component makers in Italy, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea after having weathered the February slowdown in Chinese factories that do the final assembly of products like iPhones and AirPods.In Malaysia, key suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Ibiden Co. have halted production as a result of restrictions on movements imposed by the government. Micron Technology Inc. is affected too, but said an exemption allows \u201climited semiconductor operations to continue.\u201d Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp. also have facilities there.Peru\u2019s state of emergency and nationwide lockdown have led major mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. to curb copper production there. The same is happening in other mining centers like Chile, Canada and Mongolia, with economists at Scotiabank saying the initial result from the hit in Chile and Peru alone leading to the loss of some 325,000 metric tons of copper production, or about 1.7% of global annual output.In Europe, industrial giants like Volkswagen AG and Airbus SE have shut down assembly lines in an effort both to reduce the spread of the virus and to deal with parts shortages and bottlenecks due to restrictions on travel within Europe.BottlenecksWhile governments in the region have pledged to safeguard the transport of goods as borders are shut to other nonessential travel, traffic disruptions have started to escalate. Trucks lined up for 40 miles near Berlin after the German border to Poland was closed, and diverting passenger cars to alternatives routes brought little relief.The car industry is particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Its fine-tuned logistics are designed to keep storage times to only between 1 and 2 months. The push into electric cars has added to complexity, because production of battery cells requires a steady flow of materials like lithium and cobalt.Germany\u2019s Schaeffler Group, which employs 87,000 worldwide and is a major supplier to car makers, joined peers on Thursday in hammering out emergency plans to cut capacity in Europe and avoid layoffs. Those include reducing working hours and cutting production on certain days.\u201cAs we have to reduce production in our plants in the light of the crisis, it was important to us that flexible solutions be quickly established,\u201d said Juergen Wechsler, who represents Schaeffler workers for union IG Metall.Liqui Moly GmbH, a maker of engine oil and lubricants based in the southern German city of Ulm, is suffering dramatic order declines. \u201cIf the situation demands it, I will forgo my salary,\u201d Chairman Ernst Prost said.Detroit ShutdownAnton Posner, chief executive officer of supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources, said the move by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to temporarily shut down their U.S. plants will reverberate not only through their suppliers of finished parts but in steel, aluminum and transportation.\u201cWe have ships loading steel in Europe next week headed for the U.S., but will there be shipments beyond that with industry shutting down?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho\u2019s going to hold inventory if there\u2019s no consumption?\u201dU.S. steelmaker Commercial Metals says it\u2019s still at work and facing postponements, not yet cancellations. \u201cSo all these jobs are going to come back,\u201d said CEO Barbara Smith.She hasn\u2019t had any employees infected. But as a company heavily dependent on infrastructure and other construction projects, she is also worried about job sites being shut down due to infections.

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn\u2019t a Goldman Sachs problem. Wall Street\u2019s nonstop aggressiveness is clashing with the demands of a deadly pandemic. As government officials, doctors and companies tell people around the world to stay home, interviews with bankers and traders inside the industry\u2019s giants show many feel torn between public health and private profit.\u201cPeople do come in when they have a cold,\u201d said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. \u201cSometimes you have that old boss where you\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.\u201dWall Street\u2019s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren\u2019t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he\u2019s facing pressure to be \u201ca tough guy\u201d who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there\u2019s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there\u2019s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank\u2019s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren\u2019t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. \u201cIf you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. \u201cTake sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.\u201dThe culture that\u2019s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry\u2019s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country\u2019s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.From their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan\u2019s home-lending group were told they couldn\u2019t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible to bring equipment home yet.\u201cWe have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,\u201d a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. \u201cThe remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.\u201dInside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.\u2019s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.\u201cThere are managers who will say, \u2018We\u2019re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,\u2019\u201d said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. \u201cAnd then there are others who will say, \u2018We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.\u2019\u201dThe tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Some London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank\u2019s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it\u2019s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Cash is king \u2014 despite motherlode of stimulus stocks are still falling today", "description": "The rush into cash and havens has battered risk assets almost everywhere", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-stocks-drop-dollar-rallies-on-stimulus-bets-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/cash-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 19, 2020 11:17 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks fell as investors digested a battery of economic and financial measures from global policy makers aimed at easing the market turmoil.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields.

The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said.

A day after President Donald Trump conceded the U.S. slump alone is set to be \u201ca bad one,\u201d economists threw away their forecasts that the world could avoid tumbling into recession for the first time since the financial crisis.Behind the rethink: The virus\u2019s spread to Europe and the U.S., as well as new evidence that China \u2014 the first to be hit by what is now a pandemic \u2014 experienced a harder hit to its economy than originally projected.Morgan Stanley\u2019s team, led by Chetan Ahya, said a worldwide recession is now its \u201cbase case,\u201d with growth expected to fall to 0.9 per cent this year. At Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius and colleagues predict a weakening of growth to 1.25 per cent. S&P Global added its voice to the chorus with a report expecting that growth would range 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent.Such slumps would not be as painful as the 0.8 per cent contraction of 2009, as measured by the International Monetary Fund, but they would be worse than the downturns of 2001 and the early 1990s. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs anticipate a rebound in the second half, but warn that the risk remains of even greater economic pain. The projections will apply further pressure on policy makers to do more to limit the health emergency and to deliver stimulus that helps companies and consumers through the shock and then drives a rebound in demand afterward.Although the U.S. Federal Reserve and fellow central banks have been active in loosening monetary policy, most governments have been slow in responding and are only now crafting fiscal packages that may still fail to pacify worried investors.\u201cWhile the policy response will provide downside protection, the underlying damage from both COVID-19\u2019s impact and tighter financial conditions will deliver a material shock to the global economy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s economists said.The outlook could darken even further if the virus lasts longer than anticipated, or wields greater economic pain \u2014 given factories, schools, restaurants and shops are closing around the world. A freezing up of markets or a continued sluggishness by governments to act are also regarded as threats.Elsewhere on Wall Street, strategists are laying out what governments should be doing.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., John Normand advocated developed economies repeating their handiwork of the crisis when they delivered fiscal stimulus worth 1 per cent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. George Saravelos, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said governments may also need to step in to guarantee support for households and companiesWhile the Fed gets \u201cfull marks\u201d for its recent response in cutting rates and moving to stabilize credit markets, Northern Trust Corp. Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said Congress and the White House have so far failed to act boldly enough.\u201cThe other side of Washington really needs to step up with something as substantial in size, and intelligent in design,\u201d he said.China is experiencing the biggest pain, and most economists failed to capture how far it would fall, with the likelihood now that its economy will suffer the worst turmoil in many decades. The Morgan Stanley economists now reckon its economy shrank 5 per cent in the second quarter.Since the outbreak originated in China, data is being treated by many as a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in other regions. Morgan Stanley predicts the U.S. and European economies will suffer the most in the second quarter.Predictions for the U.S. still vary wildly, with some guessing activity could even decline as much 10 per cent on an annualized basis in the three months through June. Goldman Sachs is penciling in a 5 per cent dive after zero growth in the first quarter.\u201cThe middle two quarters of this year are going to be very challenging, even if we get the spread of the coronavirus under control quickly,\u201d said Tannenbaum.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe", "title": "In a sea of red, this Canadian supply-chain stock comes out on top", "description": "Ottawa-based Kinaxis Inc. provides supply-chain-management software \u2014 crucial amid the havoc caused by the pandemic on global shipments", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/in-a-sea-of-red-this-canadian-supply-chain-stock-comes-out-on-top", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/ford.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 17, 2020 10:06 AM EDT", "content": "A company that makes software to track supply chains is the best performing stock in a rout that\u2019s lopped almost 30 per cent off Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite index.Ottawa-based Kinaxis Inc. provides supply-chain-management software \u2014 crucial amid the havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic on global shipments.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used. The Fed\u2019s key rate is now 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent, matching the record low it was last at in 2015.President Donald Trump, who as recently as Saturday attacked the Fed for not lowering rates faster and further, quickly expressed support for the move.\u201cIt makes me very happy and I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big step and I\u2019m very happy they did it.\u201dU.S. stock futures tumbled steeply after the announcement, as investors worried that emergency measures by the Fed would fall short in countering the virus\u2019s damage to the economy.

That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession. Stocks have already tumbled into a bear market.\u201cThe Fed cannot combat a public health crisis, but they can provide a helpful hand when the crisis abates,\u201d said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economic research at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.The Fed said it will keep interest rates near zero \u201cuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201dThe central bank acted the day before leaders from the Group of Seven nations, including Trump, are set to discuss their virus response on a teleconference. Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers.

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices. That\u2019s about twice the 15 per cent slump in the three weeks after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.Before the market opened on Thursday, Bloomberg gathered with three top investors to discuss where we go from here. Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here\u2019s a synopsis of the discussion.Financial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that\u2019s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. \u201cHistorically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,\u201d she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. \u201cLiquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dEither way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.\u201cThey are not traditional market makers any longer,\u201d said McCreadie. \u201cI think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.\u201dThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country\u2019s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.\u201cIf you look at the impact on the oil market, it\u2019s very, very negative for Western Canada,\u201d Vanderhooft said. \u201cAs bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.\u201dSmaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.\u201cThis time around a lot of these smaller players aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.\u201dThe increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks\u2019 thinking more now, said Marks. \u201cYou already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.\u201dVanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a \u201cmore negative position\u201d on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.All three strategists say the markets will come back.

A rapid rise in coronavirus cases globally, the sharp fall in oil prices and volatility in financial markets make a contraction in the second and third quarters this year \u201clikely\u201d in the absence of fiscal measures, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, chief economist at Scotiabank, said Wednesday.\u201cA reasonably mild recession appears likely unless timely and targeted fiscal measures are deployed in the very near future to deal with the economic impacts of the virus,\u201d Perrault wrote in a research note.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released $1.1 billion in new funding earlier Wednesday in response to the virus, and said the government is ready to do more if necessary. Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank\u2019s isn\u2019t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada\u2019s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank \u2014 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois PerraultSees Canada\u2019s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP. Without fiscal stimulus, Q2 and Q3 GDP will contract. Expects the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the next two meetings.Bank of Montreal \u2014 Michael GregoryLowers 2020 GDP to 0.5 per cent from one per cent, and sees Q2 contracting by 3.5 per cent.

While there\u2019s no immediate plan to adjust the province\u2019s program limiting oil output, the government will monitor inventories and step in if storage nears capacity.\u201cWe will use the curtailment tool responsibly to ensure at least a survival price for our producers to get through this,\u201d Kenney said.Alberta\u2019s government has pledged to do what\u2019s necessary to shore up its oil-dependent economy after world crude prices fell the most since 1991 this week amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two countries\u2019 battle over control of the global oil market comes as the coronavirus pandemic has obliterated energy demand. The sudden collapse in oil prices hit Canadian oil companies hard, prompting oil sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. to slash capital spending by 32% and cancel its crude-by-rail program.After conversations with business leaders in recent days, Kenney said he\u2019s also considering payroll tax relief and using the province\u2019s balance sheet to help companies with their current liquidity crisis.Canada\u2019s oilpatch was already struggling with pipeline shortages that prompted the province to impose production limits on its largest producers at the start of last year. The government had started relaxing those restrictions prior to the market downturn.While no new pipelines are expected to be constructed before year-end at the earliest, increasing volumes of crude have been flowing to the U.S. Gulf Coast on rail lines. Those shipments are now threatened after heavy Western Canadian Select\u2019s price tumbled, with its discount to West Texas Intermediate futures shrinking to US$12.75 a barrel on Wednesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That\u2019s too small a price difference to support most crude-by-rail shipments, which require a US$15 to US$18 a barrel discount.Western Canadian oil stockpiles, stored primarily in hubs at Edmonton and Hardisty, Alberta, had reached 37 million barrels at the end of December, Imperial Oil Ltd. executives said in January.

Studies show it\u2019s at least theoretically possible for other coronaviruses to survive on the dollar\u2019s cotton-and-linen weave, though there\u2019s little agreement on the actual risk of contagion.Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there\u2019s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it\u2019s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it\u2019s safe.The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue.On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it\u2019s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low \u2014 comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail.If, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry\u2019s long-running \u201cwar on cash,\u201d sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances.Firms such as Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and a slew of large card-issuing banks would be among the top beneficiaries.The virus may end up serving as a \u201ctrigger event\u201d for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said.\u201cDigital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is another reason: \u2018Oh, and it\u2019s hygienic too.\u2019\u201dAnd on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going \u201ccashless.\u201d Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted.Some of those groups worry they\u2019re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus.\u201cGoing cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,\u201d said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. \u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you\u2019re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.\u201dDespite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10.Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked \u2014 with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open.\u201cIf you want to go that direction, it\u2019s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,\u201d John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. \u201cThere\u2019s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.\u201dPaper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects. One study in 2013 showed the dollar has the ability to show \u201csignificant and prolonged carriage\u201d of the dreaded Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria known as MSRA.A 2020 study of coronaviruses, which included SARS and MERS, showed the microbes can persist on surfaces for as long as nine days. That can be reduced significantly using ethanol-based disinfectant, according to the study, but cleaning a paper bill proves more difficult than a plastic surface like a desk.Confronted with COVID-19, the People\u2019s Bank of China began using ultraviolet light and high-temperature ovens to disinfect cash coming in. It has also replaced old notes with newly minted bills.The Fed is staying in contact with the CDC to make sure it\u2019s aware of the agency\u2019s latest thinking on how the virus spreads, a spokeswoman for the central bank said.So far during the current outbreak, the Fed hasn\u2019t widely enacted its longstanding protocol for banks handling bills suspected of being dangerous: First stacking them in \u201cstraps\u201d of 100, then bundling those into larger bricks and packaging them in plastic bags with the word \u201cCONTAMINATED\u201d scribbled in permanent ink.Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world\u2019s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector.\u201cIn the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat said in an interview. \u201cPeople are just not traveling internationally and this is one of the most profitable businesses that these companies have.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Julie Johnsson", "title": "Air Canada cuts its 737 Max order by 17%, dealing fresh blow to Boeing", "description": "Air Canada still has 26 of the planes on order", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/air-canada-cuts-its-737-max-order-by-17-dealing-fresh-blow-to-boeing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/air-canada-max.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 11, 2020 1:08 PM EDT", "content": "Boeing Co.\u2019s beleaguered 737 Max absorbed a new blow as Air Canada chopped an order for the grounded aircraft by 11 jets, or 18 per cent.The Canadian carrier still has 26 of the planes on order, according to data released Wednesday on Boeing\u2019s website for the month of February.

In February, Saudi Arabia produced about 9.7 million barrels a day.Welcome to the free market. The world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stabilityIt\u2019s the latest manoeuvre in what\u2019s set to be a long and bitter conflict between Russia and Saudi Arabia. On Monday benchmark oil prices fell more than 20 per cent, the largest one-day drop in almost 30 years, creating mayhem in global equity and bond markets.Oil prices initially pared gains on Tuesday, but later resumed its advance amid a broader rally in global markets. Brent crude was trading 9.4 per cent higher at US$37.54 a barrel at 10:49 a.m. in London. The benchmark plunged 24 per cent on Monday, the biggest drop in almost 30 years.Moscow responded within minutes in what looked like a war of words, with Alexander Novak, the country\u2019s energy minister, saying Russia had the ability to boost production by 500,000 barrels a day. That would put the country\u2019s output potentially at 11.8 million barrels a day \u2014 a record.The outcome of the price war will be determined by Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2019s ability to inflict damage, but also their ability to absorb it.Saudi Arabia has greater offensive abilities, thanks to about 2 million barrels a day of idle production capacity. Riyadh can also use its strategic oil stocks to boost supplies at very short notice, according to people familiar with its strategy.On top of domestic stockpiles, it also stores crude near consumption hubs in Rotterdam, Okinawa and the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir. Russia doesn\u2019t have a network of strategic oil stocks to match.Russia may have the defensive advantage. The Kremlin can dip into its US$150 billion wealth fund to offset the slump and bolster the ruble. Those reserves are sufficient to cover lost revenue \u201cfor six to 10 years\u201d at oil prices of US$25 to $30 a barrel, the Finance Ministry said.Should Brent crude remain at US$35 without an adjustment in Saudi spending, the kingdom would run a deficit of nearly 15 per cent of economic output in 2020, while its net foreign reserves could run out in about five years unless it uses other funding sources, according to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.\u201cWelcome to the free market,\u201d said Bob McNally, founder of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. \u201cThe world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stability, not only for the global oil market but the broader economy and geopolitics.\u201dFor decades, the oil market has been largely regulated. First by Americans, who set production quotas for their oil companies through the Texas Railroad Commission in the first half of the 20th century, and later by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel. Through that time, Texas and later OPEC acted as swing producers, upping output at times of scarcity and reducing it at times of lower demand, to keep prices stable.With oil demand rapidly falling due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, the Saudi production hike, followed potentially by another one from Russia, is likely to force oil companies to store crude, rather than process it. Traders are already seeking out tankers to store the glut.The International Energy Agency earlier this week said that global oil demand will contract this year for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.The U.S. and other Western countries are starting to worry about the oil price war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful petroleum nations. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Energy denounced in a rare statement \u201cattempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets\u201d.Even as both sides ramped up production and the war of words, Novak said the door wasn\u2019t closed to future talks.

The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Canadian energy companies \u201care better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. \u201cWhile in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels \u2014 WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time \u2014 some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.\u201cThe industry simply doesn\u2019t work at these prices,\u201d Ollenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands. I mean the industry globally doesn\u2019t work at these prices.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Oil price plunge stokes fears of a recession in Canada", "description": "The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/oil-price-plunge-stokes-fears-of-a-recession-in-canada?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/canadian-flag.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2020 3:58 PM EDT", "content": "Economists in Canada are scrambling to revise down their growth forecasts on tumbling oil prices that are stoking fears of a recession.Rising coronavirus concerns prompted economists to start reducing gross domestic product estimates last week. Monday\u2019s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added.The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.The Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Metcalf and Venus Feng", "title": "Wealth wipeout from market meltdown reshapes ranks of world's richest people", "description": "Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett are both down US$4.4 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/wealth-wipeout-from-market-meltdown-reshapes-ranks-of-worlds-richest-people?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jeff-bezos.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2020 2:31 PM EDT", "content": "The wealth destruction caused by Monday\u2019s market collapse is reshaping the ranks of the world\u2019s richest people.Wildcatter Harold Hamm\u2019s fortune plunged 35 per cent to US$3 billion at 11:06 a.m. in New York, a drop that would bump him from the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index if it holds through the close of trading.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index pared the declines to about 5 per cent heading into the lunch hour as investors absorbed the prospect of an oil price war triggered by the breakup of the OPEC+ alliance and mounting concerns about how the spreading coronavirus will affect the global economy.While about 85 per cent of the people on Bloomberg\u2019s wealth ranking were nursing losses Monday, there were some winners, including the Walton family, as investors seeking safe havens boosted shares of retailer Walmart Inc.China\u2019s Qin Yinglin added US$537 million to his net worth as shares of his Muyuan Foodstuff Co. rose 4 per cent.

For central bankers, the prospect of destabilizing prices are an added complication as they try to model the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy. And a long period of cheap oil prices could even hurt the fight against climate change by slowing the transition to renewable energy.\u201cSomething like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy,\u201d said Rohitesh Dhawan, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group in London.There are winners from rock-bottom oil prices \u2014 among them China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer, whose recovery from the virus will be key for the global economy.Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economyBut this time is different. The U.S. \u2014 once a winner from low oil \u2014 is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks \u2014 on the way up \u2014 used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.\u201cLower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. \u201cBut now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.\u201dThe crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there\u2019s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday\u2019s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry \u2014 when prices went as low as US$26 \u2014 contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year\u2019s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdownRussia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it\u2019s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency \u2014 unlike Saudi Arabia \u2014 and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.\u201cRussia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic \u2014 and even political \u2014 self-harm didn\u2019t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Saudi Aramco \u2014 the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince\u2019s credibility on the line \u2014 saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.\u201cOil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,\u201d said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.More immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred \u2014 as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc \u2014 though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it\u2019s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.\u201cSharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors\u2019 energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,\u201d said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIn the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.\u201dThe crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry\u2019s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.A slowdown in green plans isn\u2019t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use \u2014 increasing emissions \u2014 and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe \u2014 which is leading the charge on climate change policies \u2014 the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn\u2019t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.\u201cThe Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it\u2019s not clear this will work,\u201d said the LSE\u2019s Hertog, author of \u2018Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia\u2019.\u201cIn the end, this will be Putin\u2019s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dan Murtaugh and Alfred Cang", "title": "Oil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out", "description": "Goldman Sachs warns prices could drop to near $20", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-drops-31-in-worst-loss-since-gulf-war-as-price-fight-erupts", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/oil.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2020 6:44 PM EDT", "content": "Oil markets tumbled more than 30 per cent after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price-war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that is likely to have sweeping political and economic consequences.Brent futures suffered the second-largest drop on record in the opening seconds of trading in Asia, behind only the plunge during the Gulf War in 1991.

The fight against climate change may suffer a setback as fossil fuels become more competitive versus renewable energy.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, the market was overwhelmed by a wave of selling at the open,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Houston-based energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC. \u201cOPEC+ has clearly surprised the market by engaging in a price war to gain market share.\u201dHammered by a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus, the oil market is sinking deeper into chaos on the prospect of a supply free-for-all. Saudi Arabia slashed its official prices by the most in at least 20 years over the weekend and signalled to buyers it would ramp up output \u2014 an unambiguous declaration of intent to flood the market with crude. Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could.Aramco\u2019s unprecedented pricing move came just hours after the talks between Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies ended in dramatic failure. The breakup of the alliance effectively ends the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.The state-owned Saudi producer has privately told some market participants it plans to raise output well above 10 million barrels a day next month and could even reach a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.Oil prices have suffered massive drops each time that Saudi Arabia has launched a price war to drive competitors out of the market. West Texas Intermediate fell 66 per cent from late 1985 to March 1986 when the country pumped at will amid a resurgence of U.S. oil output. Brent crude briefly dropped below US$10 a barrel when the kingdom had a showdown with Venezuela in the late 1990s.With oil demand already plummeting due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, traders forecast that prices will drop even further. \u201cThe oil market is now faced with two highly uncertain bearish shocks with the clear outcome of a sharp price sell-off,\u201d said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York.Brent for May settlement tumbled as much as US$14.25 a barrel to US$31.02 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, the biggest intra-day loss since the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in January 1991. It pared some of those losses to trade 22 per cent lower at US$35.39 a barrel as of 8:04 a.m. in Singapore.West Texas Intermediate crude plunged 22 per cent to US$32.22 a barrel after sliding as much as 27 per cent to US$30 a barrel just after the open. Trading was frozen for the first few minutes because of the scale of the loss.While the price crash was dramatic, for oil specialists the movements in time-spreads, options and volatility are just as remarkable. Brent\u2019s three-month price structure widened sharply as oil for prompt delivery collapsed against later shipments. It moved deeper into contango, a sign of bearishness and oversupply, making it profitable for physical traders to buy crude and put it in storage, either in onshore tank farms or at sea on tankers.The plunge in oil also ricocheted across financial markets. U.S. equity futures plunged, along with oil currencies including the Norwegian krone and Mexican peso, while havens such as the Japanese yen and gold jumped. Shares of oil producers got hammered, with Australia\u2019s Santos Ltd. and Oil Search Ltd. losing more than 20 per cent in early Sydney trading.The prospect of another price war is spooking traders who will remember the crash that began in 2014, when an explosion in U.S. shale production prompted OPEC to open the spigots in an attempt to suppress prices and curtail shale output.That strategy ended in failure, with shale producers proving too resilient and Brent crude tumbling below $30 a barrel in 2016 amid a global glut. It was that crash that prompted OPEC to club together with Russia and others to curtail output and help shore up their oil-dependent economies.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Anthony DiPaola and Javier Blas", "title": "#ICYMI Oil prices are tanking because Saudi Arabia has launched an all-out price war", "description": "Pact between Saudis and Russians that has underpinned oil prices since 2016 has collapsed", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/aramco-slashes-crude-pricing-starting-oil-war-as-opec-flops", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/aramco.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2020 3:16 AM EDT", "content": "Saudi Arabia kicked off an all-out oil war on Saturday, slashing official pricing for its crude and making the deepest cuts in at least 20 years on its main grades, in a bid to push as many barrels into the market as possible.The cuts in monthly pricing by state producer Saudi Aramco are the first indication of how the Saudis will respond to the breakup of the alliance between OPEC and partners like Russia. The kingdom plans to accompany the price cuts with a hike in crude supply, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price warAramco\u2019s pricing announcement is the first major marketing decision since producer talks in Vienna ended in dramatic failure on Friday, when Saudi Arabia was unable to persuade Russia to agree to prolonged and deeper cuts in output. Saudi production is set to exceed 10 million barrels a day next month, according to the people, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations. Such an increase would amount to more than 3 per cent of Saudi output in February.\u201cSaudi Arabia is now really going into a full price war,\u201d said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at oil consultant FGE.The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016. Unshackled from the cartel\u2019s restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output. A reduction in the official selling prices, or OSPs, suggests the Saudis are looking to do just that.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a high-risk, high-stakes approach,\u201d Tim Fox, chief economist at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC, said Sunday in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cIt will be a question of who blinks first.\u201dAramco\u2019s pricing decision affects about 14 million barrels a day of oil exports, as other producers in the Persian Gulf region follow its lead in setting prices for their own shipments. Every month, the Gulf\u2019s biggest producers announce the official selling price for their crude grades as a differential \u2014 a premium or discount \u2014 against regional benchmarks. The changes are usually measured in cents and, at most, a couple of dollars.The state producer lowered April pricing for crude sales to Asia by US$4 to US$6 a barrel and to the U.S. by US$7 a barrel, it said in a pricing announcement emailed Saturday just before midnight Saudi time. Aramco didn\u2019t immediately comment on the strategy behind such deep reductions in pricing.With the coronavirus eroding demand, pushing Brent crude down about 20 per cent so far this year heading into the meeting on Friday, the Saudis had hoped to shore up prices. Brent fell further after Russia balked at OPEC\u2019s plan, closing the week down more than 30 per cent for the year.Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by US$6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company\u2019s pricing sheet.Aramco sells most of its crude in Asia, a region that \u2014 until the virus outbreak in China \u2014 had served as the driver for global growth in energy demand.The company lowered pricing to northwest Europe and to the Mediterranean region by between $6 and $8 a barrel. Aramco made its biggest cut for crude to northwest Europe, where an $8 a barrel reduction in most grades amounts to a direct challenge to Russia, which sells a large chunk of its flagship Urals crude in the same region. Aramco will sell Arab Light at an unprecedented $10.25 a barrel discount to Brent in Europe.The world\u2019s biggest oil exporter had expected to announce its pricing on Thursday but delayed the decision until after the meeting on Friday between the OPEC and allies including Russia. The postponement marked the first time in at least a decade that Aramco missed its pricing schedule. It typically announces pricing for its crude on the fifth day of each month.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada beats forecasts with gain of 30,300 jobs in show of resilience", "description": "Unemployment rate rises to 5.6 per cent", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-gains-surprise-30300-jobs-in-february-jobless-rate-climbs-to-5-6", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jobs.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2020 9:05 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s job market strengthened for a third-straight month, a sign of strength within the domestic economy even as the spread of coronavirus threatens future growth.Canadian employment grew by 30,300 in February, beating economist expectations for 11,000 new jobs, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa.

But regulatory proposals by the EU\u2019s executive arm are subject to approval by member states, and the climate law reflects the need to seek a compromise between competing national positions. With differing energy mixes, wealth and industrial strength, EU governments are set to wrangle over every bit of the climate strategy and the draft law that will set the basis for the clean-up.However, the dynamics may change with the draft measure. It will pave the way for a new regulatory track where measures to cut emissions avoid a veto by a single country, a tool that was used several times by coal-dependent Poland to halt ambitious policies.Once approved by national governments and the European Parliament, the climate law will start a regulatory frenzy. Everything from energy production to agriculture and the design of cities will be overhauled under the Green Deal strategy that von der Leyen has described as a moonshot.\u201cI\u2019m excited by this,\u201d said Peter Vis, senior adviser at Rud Pedersen Public Affairs in Brussels. \u201cVon der Leyen is setting the ambition without knowing how we will get there. But when Kennedy committed to putting a man on the moon he also wouldn\u2019t know if that is possible.\u201dHere are the main elements of the draft law:The EU executive is also seeking more powers to make sure the bloc delivers on the net-zero emissions goal, making it more difficult for governments and the EU Parliament to object to intermediate targets. It wants to regulate those goals via measures known as delegated acts. To oppose them, a qualified majority of votes is needed in the Council of the EU, which represents member states, and a majority in the Parliament.\u201cEnshrining the climate neutrality goal into law is a crucial and welcome step,\u201d said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch lobby in Brussels. \u201cHowever, the climate law\u2019s success will be determined by how it translates into short-term climate action. Europe faces an existential climate crisis and every year matters to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.\u201dThe biggest challenge for Europe will be to secure investment for the environmental clean-up. The costs are dizzying: to reach the existing 2030 goal Europe needs investment of 260 billion euros (US$290 billion) annually.Earlier this year, the commission proposed a 1 trillion-euro plan designed to be the financing pillar of the Green Deal. It envisions earmarking around 500 billion euros from the EU budget for the clean shift over the next decade, while separately leveraging 280 billion euros of private and public investment and establishing a funding mechanism with another 143 billion euros, also from public and private sources, to help regions facing the most costly clean-ups.To ensure the Green Deal materializes to be Europe\u2019s new growth strategy, new markets must be developed, with both public and private finance flowing to small and large companies alike to help them deploy first new technologies, according to director general of the chemical industry association Cefic.\u201cThe proposal for a climate law is an important first step to achieve investor confidence, which is crucial,\u201d Mensink said. \u201cIt is a start of an important journey; our sector must go through a deep transformation, within only one or two investment cycles, for which we need enabling conditions. Therefore, much more is needed.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo and Esteban Duarte", "title": "A hedge fund pioneer bets on higher rates, recovery in stocks after temporary coronavirus setback", "description": "David Picton expects a V-shaped recovery later in the year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/a-hedge-fund-pioneer-bets-on-higher-rates-recovery-in-stocks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 9:59 AM EST", "content": "A top hedge fund manager in Canada says the coronavirus sell-off is a temporary setback that will soon give way to an economic rebound, sending stocks and interest rates higher.\u201cWhile there will certainly be an economic hit from the virus, when you go back through these \u2018pandemic\u2019 periods of time, there\u2019s really, without exception, a fairly significant recovery that takes place in markets and economies,\u201d David Picton, founder of hedge fund Picton Mahoney Asset Management, said during an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s office in Toronto.The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency half-percentage point rate cut Tuesday, a dramatic signal that policy makers are growing more worried about the economic threat from the virus. Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent.Bank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a \u201csignificant interruption\u201d to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past \u2014 a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus \u2014 have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added.That is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201dPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.For Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201dPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.The Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.As recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Virus-driven interest rate cut could add kerosene to Canada's already hot housing market", "description": "Market poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/virus-driven-rate-cut-could-add-kerosene-to-canadas-housing-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 10:30 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s housing market is poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus.While a reduced travel from China may crimp sales in Vancouver, and the potential for a recession could set the market back, the possibility of interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada is likely to fuel further declines in mortgage rates and draw buyers into the market.\u201cPeople are not concerned about coronavirus, people are not concerned about recession,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said Monday by phone. \u201cThe only things they\u2019re worried about is buying a home \u2014 and if they don\u2019t buy now they might spend more in the future.\u201dA confluence of factors is priming the pump for a brisk buying season.

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a \u2018long lasting\u2019 epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks\u2019 action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points.Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.\u201cGlobal central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201dWith interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.\u201cCentral banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, \u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.The Bank of Japan backed up Monday\u2019s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia\u2019s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan\u2019s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan\u2019s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed\u2019s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn\u2019t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde\u2019s comments of last week.\u201cWe are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closedFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That\u2019s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world\u2019s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won\u2019t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they\u2019re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.\u201cRate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,\u201d said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Richard Clough and Rachel Layne", "title": "Jack Welch, \u2018manager of the century\u2019 who reshaped GE, dies at 84", "description": "Led the industrial conglomerate for two decades", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/jack-welch-former-ge-veteran-dies-cnbc", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jack-welch.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 2, 2020 9:33 AM EST", "content": "Jack Welch, the champion of corporate efficiency who built General Electric Co. into one of the world\u2019s largest companies and influenced generations of business leaders, has died.

He created a leaner company, yet one whose dependence on finance would eventually prove to be a threat. Along the way, he molded GE\u2019s culture to reflect his demanding personality, one larger than his 5-foot-7-inch (1.7-meter) frame.\u201cI like challenging people. I like debate. I like all those things,\u201d he told interviewer Charlie Rose less than two months after his 2001 retirement. \u201cAnd yet I love having a drink with \u2019em, too.\u201dWelch stepped down four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He remained active for more than a decade as a consultant and media commentator.Business leaders extolled his ability to boost profit and shareholder wealth with his restless, results-driven approach. GE became the world\u2019s biggest company by market value at more than $500 billion in 1999.Imitators across corporate America copied his leadership strategies, and recruiters snapped up lieutenants including W. James McNerney Jr., who later became Boeing Co.\u2019s CEO, and Robert Nardelli, who ran Home Depot Inc. and Chrysler. Another GE executive, Jeffrey Immelt, would best them to succeed Welch.Welch\u2019s legacy was dented in retirement, as GE\u2019s stock lost a third of its value within a year. The shares would lag behind the pre-Sept. 11 level for virtually all of Immelt\u2019s 16 years as CEO.Soon after Enron Corp. collapsed in late 2001, GE found itself facing accounting questions about whether Welch relied on moves such as one-time asset sales to produce consistently steady profit gains. GE Capital under Welch grew so vast that unit\u2019s struggles in the 2008-2009 financial crisis would imperil all of GE. The company has since exited nearly all of the lending businesses.\u201cThere\u2019s been some revisiting of the robustness of the financial services model.

There was a \u201cbacklash that did dog Jack Welch.\u201dJohn Francis Welch Jr. was born Nov. 19, 1935, in Peabody, Massachusetts. He was the only child of John Sr., a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor, and Grace Andrews Welch.Growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, he was outspoken and athletic. He played golf, hockey and baseball at Salem High School, where he was voted \u201cmost talkative and noisiest\u201d boy by classmates and wrote in the school literary magazine that he wanted to \u201cmake a million.\u201d Welch\u2019s mother infused him with self-confidence and helped him overcome a boyhood stutter \u2014 \u201cthe most influential person in my life,\u201d he wrote in his 2001 autobiography \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201dAfter a close hockey defeat as a youngster, Welch flung his stick across the ice, prompting his mother to march into the locker room, grab him by the jersey and shout: \u201cYou punk! If you don\u2019t know how to lose, you\u2019ll never know how to win.\u201dIn 1957, he graduated with honours from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst with a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. Three years later, he received a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois and took a $10,500-a-year job with GE in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the company developed new businesses in plastics.Working his way through the ranks from vice president to vice chairman, Welch gained a reputation as a maverick, questioning whether GE was being run the right way. He saw GE\u2019s future in plastics, medical equipment and financial services, not household appliances.At 45, Welch succeeded Reginald Jones as chairman and CEO. While GE was profitable, Welch was concerned that it was too big to be flexible. He sorted GE\u2019s divisions into \u201cwinners\u201d \u2014 those first or second in their industries \u2014 and \u201closers,\u201d mostly older units that had to improve or face disposal.Over a five-year span in the 1980s, he sold more than 200 businesses and closed dozens of factories. Annual dismissals of the 10 percent of employees deemed the lowest performers also became standard. Welch\u2019s moves would shrink the workforce by one-third to 239,000 people.\u201cA successful leader can shock an organization and lead its recovery. An unsuccessful leader will shock an organization and paralyze it,\u201d Welch said in a 1994 Industry Week interview. \u201cOrganizations constantly need to be regenerated.\u201dGE under Welch spent more than $25 billion on acquisitions, and he pushed into finance as the U.S. economy shifted away from manufacturing. He looked overseas, too, boosting foreign sales by more than 50 per cent.He pioneered widely imitated training programs, including \u201cWork-Out,\u201d in which employees learned to accelerate decision-making with days of brainstorming. In 1995, Welch implemented the Six Sigma quality controls to improve manufacturing processes. Noting GE\u2019s success, companies around the world would adopt a similar methodology.Welch knew thousands of employees by name and would send handwritten notes to voice his approval or dissatisfaction.\u201cHe had tremendous, tremendous passion for the business, but he also had tremendous passion for people,\u201d William Conaty, whose 40-year GE career included serving as human resources chief under Welch, said in a 2014 interview. \u201cIf your wife was sick, he\u2019d want to know how she was doing.\u201dWelch also worked six days a week, taking only Sunday off to golf \u2014 he called working weekends \u201ca blast\u201d \u2014 and expected similar dedication from those who wanted to get ahead. \u201cI never once asked anyone, \u2018Is there someplace you would rather be \u2014 or need to be \u2014 for your family or favourite hobby or whatever?\u201d\u2019 he said in his 2005 book, \u201cWinning.\u201dWelch delayed his mandatory age-65 retirement for almost a year for a final challenge: a US$53 billion bid for Honeywell International Inc. that collapsed when he balked at European regulators\u2019 demands for concessions.A lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, Welch would test executives and potential hires on their baseball knowledge. He was also a golf addict, hitting the links with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and executives including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.After leaving GE, Welch served as a part-time adviser, a partner at investment firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice and consultant to companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s business school, opened a management institute bearing his name and stayed in the public eye with guest-host gigs on CNBC and New England Sports Network.Welch married Carolyn Osburn in 1959, and they had four children before divorcing in 1987. He was married to corporate lawyer Jane Beasley for 13 years. They divorced in 2002 amid revelations of an affair with Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer that began when Wetlaufer was interviewing him for an article.The two married in 2004 and went on to collaborate on \u201cWinning,\u201d but not before divorce proceedings opened a public argument over Welch\u2019s fortune, with his second wife\u2019s lawyers claiming his asset valuation of US$456 million was at least $100 million too low. The case was settled in 2003.By then, Welch\u2019s retirement package had been shown to include his US$11 million Central Park West apartment in New York City, use of a private jet, a leased Mercedes-Benz, restaurant and laundry expenses, country-club fees and sports tickets. He later opted to pay for some perks himself.With assistance from Heather Burke.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White and Randall Jensen", "title": "Stocks surge as markets chew on prospects of central bank intervention", "description": "U.S. stocks surged the most in fourteen months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/yuan-drops-with-aussie-on-virus-fear-economy-woes-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 1, 2020 3:22 PM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks surged the most in fourteen months as investors gained confidence that stewards of the world\u2019s largest economies would act in concert to offset any impact from the spreading coronavirus.The S&P 500 rallied 4.6 per cent after news that Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers will hold a teleconference Tuesday to discuss how to respond to the outbreak.

While it probably doesn\u2019t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it\u2019s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week \u2014 and that\u2019s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox\u2019s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It\u2019s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox\u2019s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it\u2019s a pretty dry business.But the Centers for\u00a0Disease Control and Prevention is warning that\u00a0the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China\u2019s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now\u00a0threaten\u00a0the U.S. If that\u2019s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. \u201cSo far we\u2019re not seeing an uptick,\u201d Clorox CEO Benno Dorer\u00a0said during the company\u2019s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees\u00a0Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox\u2019s stock is already quite expensive, and it\u2019s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their \u201csell\u201d ratings on the stock after Clorox\u2019s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company\u2019s other product lines \u2014 bags and charcoal \u2014continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn\u2019t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it\u2019s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division \u201cgrilling\u201d to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn\u2019t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox\u2019s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it\u2019s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt\u2019s Bees lip care.)With this week\u2019s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak.\u00a0Clorox may play\u00a0its own\u00a0crucial role in combating the disease,\u00a0but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "TSX ready for opening bell after early close yesterday over technical issue", "description": "Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stock-bourse-says-ready-for-friday-open-after-early-close", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 28, 2020 7:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s main stock exchanges said all systems are ready for the start of business on Friday after halting trading for hours due to a technical issue.The Toronto Stock Exchange said interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX Group Ltd.\u2019s trading engine.

Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.\u201cI don\u2019t know the inside of what happened at the TSX.

They will be ramping up cleaning and disinfection of things people touch: from door handles, to microphones, to touchscreens.That said, most exhibitors from China were forced to pull out because of international travel restrictions, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. \u201cOthers are attempting to make alternative arrangements,\u201d Kristy Kenny said by email. \u201c\u2018At this time, cancellations by individuals and companies have been minimal.\u201dThe virus continues to spread beyond its epicentre of China with more than 82,400 cases globally and 2,800 deaths. The economic ramifications are multiplying. Analysts at Bank of America Corp. said the world economy is now on track for its weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis and stock markets continue to slump.The virus is disrupting events around the world. Banks are restricting travel and attendees at a derivatives conference in Frankfurt had their body temperature measured by an infrared camera to check for symptoms.Attendance at Toronto\u2019s PDAC event peaked in 2012, at 30,369 attendees, after which a steep downturn in prices knocked back the numbers for four straight years before they began to recover. Close to 26,000 people attended last year\u2019s conference, which PDAC says injects more than US$70 million into the local economy.With gold prices at a seven year high, and miners awash with cash, the 2020 event was shaping up to be a good one.

In social media posts, Seagal urged fans not to miss out on the token offering.

In August 2018, the Russian Foreign Ministry named him a special representative to improve relations between Russia and the U.S., according to a posting on Facebook.The actor agreed to let his likeness be used to promote Bitcoiin2Gen\u2019s token after consulting with counsel, according to a Thursday email from his lawyer. Later on, Seagal became concerned that the project wasn\u2019t legitimate and terminated the relationship.\u201cMr. Seagal cooperated fully with the SEC\u2019s investigation, and this matter is now behind him,\u201d the email said. \u201cHe looks forward to continuing his life\u2019s work as an actor, musician, martial artist and diplomat.\u201dCelebrity endorsements of ICOs \u2014 in which companies raise money by selling digital tokens instead of shares \u2014 became increasingly common as Bitcoin surged to a record high in 2017. All the hype prompted the SEC to publicly warn that pitches could be unlawful if the famous backers\u2019 compensation wasn\u2019t disclosed.In 2018, the SEC accused boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled of failing to disclose that they had received payments for hyping ICOs.

Economic growth in the fourth quarter is expected to be a measly 0.3 per cent on an annualized basis when data is released on Friday, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.While a tentative trade deal between China and the U.S. had boosted optimism, that is fading amid the coronavirus contagion and more disruptions on the country\u2019s rails, this time from protesters opposed to a natural gas pipeline.Corporate executives are only beginning to get a handle on the damage, and much will depend on how quickly the virus can be brought under control so that normal trade and travel can resume. Here are thoughts so far from Canadian companies doing business overseas.Chuck Magro, chief executive officer of the world\u2019s largest supplier of crop nutrients, is watching the impact of the coronavirus \u201chour by hour.\u201d The biggest effects so far have been on potash, he said.\u201cWe believe that the contract negotiations will move now from the first quarter to the second quarter and that\u2019s simply because most of the buying committee, large organizations are working from home,\u201d he said at an industry conference Wednesday. \u201cOur sales organizations in China are working from home. They\u2019re not meeting.\u201dPotash is stuck at its China port because the supply chain is down, he said.\u201cJust a couple of days ago the Chinese government authorized for the first time in five years the use of strategic reserves in potash. We interpret that as an indication that China is worried they don\u2019t have enough potash for the spring season.\u201dIn the long run, that will be good for the potash industry as reserves will need to be restored, he said. Agriculture is not correlated to economic growth, he added. \u201cThe old adage that people need to eat still holds.\u201dBad weather, blockades, and the virus created \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d for the Vancouver-based producer of coal, copper and zinc and Canada\u2019s largest railway customer, CEO Don Lindsay said.\u201cCommodity prices were negatively impacted by global economic uncertainty in 2019. This has continued into 2020,\u201d he told analysts on Feb. 21. \u201cThere were some signs of improvement in December and early January with an agreement on a U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal but then the coronavirus emerged and the full impact of the virus is still unknown.\u201dBefore the virus, Lindsay said, the company\u2019s plan was to sell at least one asset this year, possibly using the capital for share buybacks. \u201cWith coronavirus still prevailing, I think most people are going to\u2026wait and see how that shakes out. It\u2019s still unknown what the long-term effect is, not just the disease itself,\u201d he said.The miner\u2019s shares are down 39 per cent this year.Most of Lululemon\u2019s 38 stores in China remain closed since first shutting down due to the virus on Feb. 3., though some are coming back on a reduced schedule, CEO Calvin McDonald said.\u201cThe safety of our people is our highest priority, and we are adjusting store operations based upon the recommendations of local authorities,\u201d McDonald said in a statement on Feb. 21.The Vancouver-based company\u2019s US$1-billion international sales opportunity is being led by China, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cChina\u2019s performance- and sports-inspired apparel market is worth almost US$87 billion, and management aims to connect with 400 million active millennials,\u201d analysts Poonam Goyal and Abigail Gilmartin said in a report.McDonald said he remained confident in the long-term opportunities in China. The company will provide an update on the impact in its earnings report for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 2. That call is expected next month.The number of cargo planes flying into Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Moncton, New Brunswick, to be loaded with lobster bound for China has dwindled, said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the industry group. While the airports would typically see about nine charter flights a week, that has dropped to one a week in the past month, he said.China has become Canada\u2019s second-biggest export market for live, processed and frozen lobster next to the U.S. While February is typically a slower month for sales, lobster companies are storing the additional unsold inventory or sending it to be processed, Irvine said.\u201cThe Chinese in general are not going out to eat so they\u2019re not consuming lobster in restaurants,\u201d Irvine said by phone. \u201cThat\u2019s hopefully going to change as they go back to work and the quarantines end.\u201dCanada shipped more than $450 million (US$337 million) worth of live lobster to China in 2019, according to Statistics Canada data.Barrick is benefiting from its experience with highly contagious diseases such as Ebola to help it deal with the coronavirus, CEO Mark Bristow said in comments following a Bloomberg TV interview at a conference Feb. 24.In addition to expanding its health checks across the entire organization, Barrick is increasing supplies of raw materials such as cyanide and cement at its mines, Bristow said. The company will have three to four months worth of those \u201cconsumables\u201d on hand, compared with the one-and-a-half months it normally keeps, he said.\u201cThe thing about these epidemics is that you have to respond before they hit you,\u201d Bristow said. \u201cWe have an emergency action plan.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Canadian investors gripped by fear amid coronavirus, economic chill from rail blockades", "description": "Canada's stock market rally has cracked.

Volatility has spiked. And investors have been piling into government bonds, pushing yields to record lows.Anxiety is everywhere for investors in the nation\u2019s markets as the coronavirus outbreak and protests that hobbled rail traffic are magnifying concerns about an economic slowdown.The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost this year\u2019s gain in just four days of trading and plunged even further Thursday \u2014 leaving it down about 2 per cent in 2020. It had climbed 5.2 per cent as of Feb. 20.A technical indicator that measures buying strength versus selling strength \u2014 known as the Bloomberg Fear and Greed indicator \u2014 slumped to the lowest level since the global market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018.The coronavirus continued to spread across the world as new clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Ontario\u2019s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Wednesday a new positive case of the virus in Toronto, taking the number of infections in Canada to more than 10.Meanwhile, environmental and Indigenous-rights activists have obstructed rail lines across Canada for weeks to protest the construction of TC Energy Corp.\u2019s $6.6 billion (US$4.9 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. That has paralyzed parts of the nation\u2019s rail network in recent weeks, bringing grain movement to a near halt.Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday.Belski isn\u2019t so worried. \u201cWhile the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.\u201d Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.Market turbulence has surged. Volatility on the S&P/TSX soared to its highest in about six months. For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost five months as fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar\u2019s weakness.Traders are abandoning the Canadian dollar as the viral outbreak confounded global markets, clouding the outlook for the commodity-linked currency. It was among the worst performers of Group-of-10 peers Thursday, pushing it to levels unseen since June.The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that \u201ccurrency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special \u2014 talking the currency down in order to do the bank\u2019s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.\u201dGoldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a \u201clonger period of virus-related uncertainty,\u201d strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday.His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, \u201cdollar bloc\u201d currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year.In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That\u2019s another indicator of economic concern. Canada\u2019s 30-year government bond yield fell to a record low after breaching the Aug. 15 floor.\u201cCanadian government bonds offer two important benefits at the moment that are increasingly hard to find in the world today: a AAA credit rating and positive nominal yields,\u201d said Kurt Reiman, chief Canadian investment strategist at Blackrock Inc. \u201cDuring the latest setback for risk assets, Canadian fixed income has provided important portfolio ballast as interest rates decline \u2014 even with interest rates at incredibly low levels.\u201dAn aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1 per cent year to date, compared with a 3 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. when first sold earlier this week. The notes are trading below their initial pricing as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak.For Mark Stacey, times like this should remind investors about the advantage of having a balanced portfolio.\u201cWhile stocks have sold off aggressively, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite in recent days,\u201d said Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc. \u201cBy allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "\u2018Rock stars\u2019 of construction in high demand in Toronto, North America's fastest growing city", "description": "Demand for crane operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/construction-rock-stars-rule-in-north-americas-top-crane-city", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/crane.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 26, 2020 1:00 PM EST", "content": "As office workers pour into downtown Toronto from their morning commutes, Mathew Tiburcio is already at his seat \u2014 in a glass box hovering some 50 stories above the crowded streets.The 35-year-old is one of a brotherhood of crane operators helping to shape the skyline of Canada\u2019s largest city during a historic development boom. Toronto is dotted with more cranes than any other North American city, and Tiburcio has bragging rights for operating the tallest one.It gives him a killer view of Lake Ontario from a perch 860 feet (262 metres) up, even higher than the condo towers and office buildings nearby. But he\u2019s not getting paid to enjoy the scenery. He\u2019s doing one of the most critical tasks in construction.\u201cIt can be very stressful, especially on a big job like this,\u201d Tiburcio said on a break from helping to build CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cIt\u2019s what gets me up in the morning. Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.\u201dCrane operators have been called the \u201crock stars\u201d of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeIt\u2019s part of a decade-long building boom in North America\u2019s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada\u2019s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He\u2019s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada\u2019s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.Tiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane\u2019s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He\u2019ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane\u2019s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.\u201cYou\u2019ve got many trades that need the crane and you\u2019re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,\u201d said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. \u201cEverybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.\u201dAt 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.But the job hasn\u2019t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who\u2019s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.\u201cHe already knows all about tower cranes,\u201d Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio\u2019s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He\u2019s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him. He counts 40 \u2014 assurance that work won\u2019t dry up when this current job is done.\u201cThere are plenty more projects coming up.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Air Canada was the world's best airline stock two months ago.

Its shares have slumped 28 per cent on deepening fears that the spread of the coronavirus will hinder travel.On Tuesday, the carrier extended the cancellation of all flights between Canada and China to April 10 over concerns about the virus known as Coved-19. It also stopped daily non-stop flights between Toronto and Hong Kong until April 30 due to reduced market demand.New clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should prepare for significant disruptions to daily life if the coronavirus begins to spread locally in the U.S. Donald Trump\u2019s administration was also considering whether to adopt more restrictions on air travel because of the outbreak, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.United Airlines Holdings Inc. \u2014 the biggest U.S. airline to China before American carriers temporarily suspended flights \u2014 withdrew its 2020 profit forecast late Monday, citing uncertainty from the virus.Last year, Air Canada won the global equity crown among airlines after rising 87 per cent with plans accelerate its global presence in leisure travel with the acquisition of tour operator Transat AT.Revenue from outside Canada grew to 64 per cent of total sales last year from 59 per cent in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About one-fifth of the airline\u2019s capacity is on Pacific routes.In its fourth quarter results last week, Air Canada reported earnings per share that missed the lowest analyst estimate. The airline\u2019s outlook for the year saw first quarter Ebitda come in about C$200 million lower from the prior year, assuming its mainland China and Hong Kong services will fully recover by the third quarter and that the Boeing 737 Max aircraft will gradually return to services in that period.Air Canada still has a positive longer-term outlook despite facing near-term pressure from coronavirus risk, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Kevin Chiang wrote in a report published Tuesday.

Lee Partners, it said in a statement Tuesday. Mondelez paid about $1.2 billion for Give & Go., people with knowledge of the matter said.Representatives for Mondelez and Thomas H.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, according to the statement.\u201cWe are passionate about the consumer and this acquisition is very much on trend,\u201d Glen Walter, president of North America for Mondelez, said in an interview. \u201cWe are very passionate about the on-the-go snack.\u201dGive & Go\u2019s management will hold a minority stake in the Ontario-based company. Its headquarters will remain in Canada and all of its products will continue to be made at their current locations.The Give & Go deal reflects a dual strategy for Mondelez, which like other snack makers is building on the popularity of the indulgent food category while also responding to consumer demand for healthier treats, including vegan options.In July, Mondelez acquired a majority interest in Perfect Snacks, a maker of nut-butter based protein bars. Mondelez\u2019s Cadbury business is developing a plant-based version of its flagship Dairy Milk chocolate brand, The Telegraph reported in February.Mondelez should be able to build on solid distribution that Give & Go brands have in North America to accelerate sales, said Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\u201cThis acquisition is a good fit for Mondelez, because it brings a couple of well-known brands into the overall portfolio in categories that complement the company\u2019s core strength in cookies, crackers and chocolate,\u201d Bartashus said.Most of Give & Go sales fall into categories with stronger growth and margin profiles than some parts of Mondelez\u2019s portfolio such as gum and powdered beverages, she said.Give & Go\u2019s scale and high single-digit growth will give Mondelez an entry into the bakery and pastries, Wells Fargo & Co. analysts wrote in a note Tuesday.\u201cOver time we think capabilities exist to extend Mondelez\u2019s existing brands into new formats,\u201d they said.Thomas H.

Their cumulative return in 2019 was 273 per cent.It\u2019s early in the year to be tallying gains and losses, but it\u2019s the abrupt reversal of sentiment that\u2019s startling. Investors won\u2019t know the exact cost of the coronavirus, both in human and economic terms, for months. But they know the illness is now spreading fast outside China, and that the headwinds will hit an aging global business cycle and a U.S. equity bull market that has outlasted all others.\u201cGiven where we are in markets, given where we are in the cycle in 10 years, anything that\u2019s negative in markets they\u2019re going to jump,\u201d said Philip Webster, director of European equities at BMO Global Asset Management in London. \u201cInvestors shoot first and ask questions later at the moment.\u201dThe scorecard reflects those kinds of concerns. Industrial raw materials \u2014 the ones most exposed to the business cycle \u2014 have been hammered. Shares of companies, particularly in the riskier developing world, have tanked.At the other end of the spectrum, the ultimate safe havens for an economic downturn \u2014 gold and Treasuries \u2014 are winning in 2020, alongside high-quality American corporate debt. The preference for these dollar-denominated assets has also given wings to the greenback.These are the big survivors of the everything rally. For much of 2019, U.S. bonds and gold rallied on the back of a central bank pivot toward easier policy at the start of the year. Now, expectations that more rate cuts or stimulus will be needed to combat the impact of the coronavirus are further stoking those kinds of bets.\u201cBond yields have stayed low, stimulus is there, rates are still being held down,\u201d said Webster. \u201cYes, there\u2019s been a shift out of equities into non-risk assets, but I\u2019m fairly relaxed\u201d about where the portfolio is, he said.Overlaying the Gregorian calendar on asset moves can be deceptive, of course. Any investor or trader whose performance isn\u2019t measured annually may look at the picture very differently. For example, even with the turmoil of the past four trading sessions in U.S. stocks, an investor who bought the S&P 500 Index 12 months ago would still be up 12 per cent through Monday.On Wednesday morning stocks in particular appeared to be making fresh efforts to stabilize. Futures for the benchmark U.S. gauges fluctuated, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index clawed back well over half of its earlier losses. Market players are scrambling to figure out whether the virus will be contained and a V-shaped recovery will ensue, or if the impact will be lengthy leading to more L-shaped economic performance.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit early to know which will be the scenario,\u201d said Denis Panel, head of the multi-asset, quantitative and solutions group at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where we could increase the risk \u2014 the V \u2014 or we could reduce the risk and short the market potentially if it\u2019s an L scenario.

It\u2019s not clear that any other proposed mine would be able to clear the hurdles that felled Frontier in the years to come, possibly spelling the end of an era of megaprojects that transformed North America\u2019s energy landscape by turning Canada into the top foreign crude supplier to the U.S.\u201cThis may be the nail in the coffin,\u201d said Laura Lau, who helps manage $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. \u201cI would expect some smaller projects would have a better chance going through.\u201dOn top of middling oil prices, a pipeline capacity shortage in Canada and heightened competition from U.S. shale, the oilsands have become a particularly shunned industry in a world of rising concerns about climate change, leading some major funds to divest their holdings. And with speculation oil demand could peak in 10 years or so, companies are growing increasingly wary of committing to multibillion-dollar projects that require decades of operation to pay out.The oilsands of Alberta have drawn the ire of environmental activists because of the region\u2019s vast open-pit mines that require the clearance of forest, produce massive lakes of wastewater and consume more energy than other ways of extracting oil. Refining the sticky, black bitumen scooped from some mines in so-called upgraders is also very carbon-intensive. Newer, smaller projects, while more efficient, still use a lot of energy to extract the oil with the help of steam.While attempts to make Canada\u2019s oilsands into an economically viable source of crude have been ongoing for about a century, the industry experienced its heyday in the 2000s and 2010s, when fears abounded that the world may be running out of crude.Those fears prompted a flood of global investment as nations and international producers rushed to secure supplies. From 2004 to 2014, about $210.1 billion was invested in the oilsands, according to data from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day, and Canada shot up from the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest.The industry has struggled since global oil prices crashed from more than US$100 a barrel in mid-2014. New pipeline projects were stalled by environmentalist opposition and legal challenges, weighing on Canadian heavy crude prices. International giants including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips sold off oilsands assets. And capital spending in the oil sands fell for five straight years.The situation came to a head in late 2018, when a wave of new production, the shortage of pipeline space and a heavier-than-normal refinery maintenance season in the U.S. combined to cause a crash in Canadian heavy crude prices. That prompted Alberta\u2019s government to implement mandatory production limits that started in 2019 and may remain in effect for the rest of this year.Teck Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay, in a letter explaining the company\u2019s decision on Frontier, acknowledged the project raised broader questions over climate change and how countries\u2019 regulatory regimes should balance resource development and emissions reductions.\u201cThe growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cIn that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.\u201dBut the hard economic reality remains the potentially biggest hurdle. Frontier\u2019s 2011 application relied on long-term oil prices over its four-decade life of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven\u2019t seen since 2014. With both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude prices in the US$50-a-barrel range and the U.S.\u2019s Permian Basin continuing to pump more oil, those prices may not return anytime soon.The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved\u201cThis was the last big oilsands mining project advancing in the oilsands,\u201d said Kevin Birn, IHS Markit\u2019s director of North American crude oil markets. \u201cFully new greenfield ones outside this one, I don\u2019t think there is any.\u201dAnalysts had generally positive reactions to Teck cancelling Frontier. Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba said that despite the $1.13-billion writedown Teck would take on the project, \u201cit removes overhanging concerns about the company potentially making a significant investment in fossil fuel amid raising ESG focus.\u201dTo be sure, the oilsands industry is far from shutting down. Major producers are generally profitable and producing free cash flow. Capital spending is even projected to tick up this year. Producers are continually developing new technologies and finding ways to cut costs.They can still expand existing mines and are able to add output from what are known as in situ projects, which resemble more familiar methods of oil extraction by tapping underground resources through the use of wells. Those tend to be smaller, cheaper and faster to build.But even those projects are having trouble in the current environment. Imperial Oil Ltd. last year delayed its $2.6 billion Aspen oilsands project, which had been approved and was scheduled to start production in 2022, because of Alberta\u2019s production limits.And with the cancellation of Frontier, there are no major mine projects of the kind that formed the industry\u2019s bedrock. The last big mine to come online was Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s $17-billion Fort Hills mine, which started producing in 2018.Teck is a partner at Fort Hills and is considering getting out of that investment, too.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander", "title": "Easier mortgage rules won't fix Canada\u2019s housing crisis", "description": "Economists at two of Canada's largest banks say the solution lies in housing supply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/easier-mortgage-rules-are-no-fix-for-canadas-housing-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/housing-market.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 25, 2020 9:37 AM EST", "content": "Mortgage rule changes introduced by the finance department last week aren\u2019t sufficient to address the affordability crisis faced by many Canadians, according to two of the nation\u2019s largest banks.The finance department unveiled a new benchmark interest rate on Tuesday as part of stress tests that determine whether people qualify for insured mortgages.

The bank is making progress, with a 22 per cent increase in earnings from the business in its fiscal first quarter.

That effort faltered in the first quarter, with earnings from the U.S. personal-and-commercial division falling 21 per cent to $351 million, hurt by a surge in loan-loss provisions and tighter margins.Interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve last year had driven down the net interest margin at Bank of Montreal\u2019s U.S. banking division to its lowest level in a decade. That trend continued in the fiscal first quarter, with margins of 3.34 per cent, the lowest since 2010.Canadian banking remains the company\u2019s largest division, even amid a push to get more earnings from its U.S. operations.

Rejecting the mine would have sparked widespread anger in Alberta, where the mine would have provided jobs and investment; approving it would have alienated the Liberal prime minister\u2019s environmentalist base.However, Teck pulling the application won\u2019t be an unvarnished win for Trudeau. In a letter explaining why the miner pulled the plug, Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay placed the blame on governments, saying Canada doesn\u2019t yet have a clear framework to reconcile resource development and climate change.\u201cThe growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cIn that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.\u201dBeyond the climate-change debate, the economics of the project have changed radically since it was first proposed in 2011. Back then, crude prices often topped US$100 a barrel and fears abounded that the world was running out of oil. Canada\u2019s oilsands, which contain the world\u2019s third-largest reserves, saw a boom of spending as companies and countries rushed to secure supplies.But since then, fracking techniques unlocked massive reserves in Texas\u2019s Permian Basin, helping the U.S. surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s top oil producer. Teck\u2019s application for the project relied on long-term prices of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven\u2019t reached since 2014. West Texas Intermediate traded below $52 a barrel on Monday.The mine would have produced about 260,000 barrels of crude a day, more than the daily oil consumption of Norway. It also would have emitted the equivalent of about 4.1 million tons of carbon-dioxide a year, making it harder for Canada to meet its greenhouse-gas reduction targets.But for Alberta, which has struggled with the downturn in oil prices since 2014, Frontier would have been a boon, creating a projected 7,000 jobs during construction and as many as 2,500 operating positions during its four-decade life. It also would have contributed about $70 billion to federal, provincial and municipal governments through taxes and royalties.Teck said in its earnings statement Friday that it would need to take an impairment charge if Trudeau rejected the mine.

Buffett\u2019s company carries its Kraft Heinz investment on its balance sheet at $13.8 billion, a figure unchanged since 2018\u2019s fourth quarter, even as the market price of the stake dropped to $10.5 billion at the end of last year.Berkshire\u2019s BNSF railroad posted a 3.8 per cent gain in profit in the fourth quarter, just shy of record earnings in the previous three months, as a decline in expenses helped counter falling revenue across shipments of products such as coal, consumer items and agricultural goods.
