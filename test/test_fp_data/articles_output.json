The memo was among documents released late Thursday by the Federal Court in Ottawa after a request from Meng, who\u2019s argued the extradition was politically motivated.\u201cThe arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,\u201d the agency said, noting that Meng was also the eldest daughter of Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei. Canadian police handling the arrest recognize \u201cthe highly political nature of the arrest,\u201d the memo said.Meng is seeking to have a Canadian court dismiss the U.S. extradition request, arguing that her arrest was conducted unlawfully. She accuses Canadian police, border officials and the FBI of coordinating secretly to question her for hours and obtain passwords to her electronic devices before formally charging her.Huawei CFO Exposes Cracks in Case Where Only 1% SucceedThe latest memo also notes that the FBI didn\u2019t attend Meng\u2019s arrest \u201cin an effort to avoid perception of influence.\u201dIn filings to the Ottawa court seeking further disclosure, Meng accuses Canada of \u201ccoordinated state misconduct,\u201d describing the handling of her arrest as \u201cso serious\u201d that it constitutes one of the clearest cases of an abuse of process and justifies ending the extradition process.Meng has emerged as the highest-profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company. The U.S. seeks to try Meng on charges of defrauding banks by tricking them into conducting transactions that violated American sanctions on Iran. China has accused Canada of abetting \u201ca political persecution\u201d against Huawei and Meng. While the pursuit of Meng by U.S. authorities predates the current administration, U.S. President Donald Trump muddied the legal waters early on when he indicated he might try to intervene in Meng\u2019s case to boost a China trade deal.Relations Strained\u201cThis planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,\u201d the spy agency predicted in its memo, noting an earlier U.S. extradition case involving a Chinese millionaire businessman Su Bin. When Su was arrested in a Vancouver suburb in 2014, Chinese security agents swiftly jailed a Canadian couple in China, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who became pawns in a high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from handing over Su.Similarly, within days of Meng\u2019s 2018 arrest, Beijing jailed two Canadians \u2014 Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig \u2014 who\u2019ve spent 550 days in detention and have not yet been charged. China-Canada relations are in their darkest period in decades after China also halted billions of dollars in Canadian imports and put two other Canadians on death row.Meng is seeking an unredacted version of the memo, along with further documents that Canada is withholding on national security grounds. She plans to appoint a lawyer with security clearance to argue on her behalf in closed proceedings at the Federal Court in Ottawa.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Metcalf, Gabrielle Coppola and Ed Ludlow", "title": "'I'll let the haters hate': Nikola founder sees fortune surge to $7.4-billion amid criticism from pro-Tesla community", "description": "Time will tell if Nikola\u2019s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/nikola-founder-billionaire-criticism-tesla-community", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/trevor-milton-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 12, 2020 4:32 PM EDT", "content": "His company has sent his net worth soaring to $7.4 billion, but Trevor Milton is frustrated.The executive chairman of Nikola Corp. is under siege from skeptics of the company he started in 2014 with the goal of revolutionizing the trucking industry. The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they\u2019re worth US$10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola\u2019s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.\u201cWe had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s not worth people thinking that we\u2019re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that\u2019s using people\u2019s money,\u2019\u201d Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force. The pro-Tesla community is particularly harsh.\u201cPeople started bashing us because they said, \u2018Oh you don\u2019t have deposits.\u2019 It\u2019s like, good hell, you can\u2019t win with these people,\u201d Milton said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you can\u2019t win.\u201dOf course, converting free orders into binding contracts with paid deposits is just the start of the challenges ahead. Milton, 38, first showed Nikola\u2019s debut semi truck 3 1/2 years ago and has produced only prototypes thus far. Its business model \u2014 bundling big rigs and the hydrogen to fuel them upfront \u2014 has yet to be tested. Toyota Motor Corp. is five years into producing its first fuel-cell car, and the richest and most valuable automaker in the world has barely gotten sales off the ground.Time will tell if Nikola\u2019s surge in its first week of trading was a story of short-lived exuberance, where an unproven startup rode a wave of retail investors gobbling up shares of shaky companies. After a two-day retreat, the stock surged as much as 12 per cent on Friday. Milton, who owns about a third of Nikola \u2014 a stake investors valued as high as US$10 billion this week \u2014 says he doesn\u2019t care.\u201cIt\u2019s really part of the noise,\u201d Milton said. His focus is on building Nikola, and he can\u2019t sell any shares for the next 12 months. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any emotion to those numbers because they\u2019re not real right now when it comes to my vision for the next five or 10 years.\u201dNikola\u2019s stock doubled on Monday after Milton tweeted the company will start taking reservations for a pickup model called the Badger. He didn\u2019t mention until after the market closed that deliveries are still two years away and subject to a partnership with an established manufacturer that has yet to be announced.The next day, Milton told Yahoo Finance that his goal was to dethrone F-150, the crown jewel of Ford Motor Co.\u2019s pickup franchise that\u2019s topped U.S. sales charts for the last 43 years. Nikola finished the day with almost the same market value as Ford, which had US$156 billion of revenue last year.A company that isn\u2019t expecting to have its first US$1 billion revenue year until 2023 suddenly rivalling Ford drew some attention. Andrew Left, the outspoken short seller and founder of Citron Research, predicted Nikola\u2019s stock price, which got as high as US$93.99 in intraday trading Tuesday, would be back to US$40 in a month.\u201cYou can\u2019t even borrow the stock now because everybody wants to short it,\u201d said Left, who confirmed by phone Thursday that he is among those betting against the shares. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they never get a truck on the road.\u201dMilton, who\u2019s been tweeting dozens of times a day and done roughly 30 media interviews since Nikola\u2019s listing, saw Citron\u2019s post.\u201cHe never even bothered reaching out,\u201d Milton said of Left. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a s\u2014 about the facts.\u201dMilton\u2019s big ambitions, Twitter sparring and choice of name for his company have drawn inevitable comparisons with Elon Musk, who ranks 209 spots higher on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with an estimated US$47.4 billion net worth.In addition to being named after the same famed inventor, the companies share the goal of shaking up the trucking market. Nikola sued Tesla in May 2018, claiming the maker of the Model 3 had copied patented design features of its tractor trailers.Musk called the suit \u201claughable\u201d and said the claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d on an earnings call the day after Nikola filed its complaint.Nikola\u2019s stock retreated Wednesday after Musk, 48, told employees in an internal email it was \u201ctime to go all out\u201d and put Tesla\u2019s Semi into volume production.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like us, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d Milton said of Musk.Born in Utah in the early 1980s, Milton grew up on a farm and spent 18 months in Brazil teaching English on a church mission. He called living in the slums \u201ca humbling experience.\u201dHe then studied Spanish in Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. He sold his first venture \u2014 an alarm-system company \u2014 for about $1.5 million. \u201cI thought I was on top of the world,\u201d he said.Other pursuits followed before Milton founded dHybrid Systems LLC, storage-technology company for natural gas that was acquired by metals manufacturer Worthington Industries Inc. Milton left to establish Nikola in 2014 and agreed to a $2-million seed investment from his former employer on the back of the napkin.Come back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s doneHe picked up more investors along the way. Activist Jeff Ubben of ValueAct Capital Management cold called him in 2017 and ended up putting in more than US$30 million. CNH Industrial NV, the maker of Iveco trucks that\u2019s part of the billionaire Agnelli family\u2019s empire, invested US$100 million in cash and committed to a US$150 million in-kind contribution last year.Milton, who agreed to a reduced salary last year to offset costs associated with his airplane pilot being on Nikola\u2019s payroll, flies back and forth often between the company\u2019s Phoenix headquarters and his ranch. When in Utah, he likes to head out on his four wheeler.He says speeding through the mountains helps him clear his head and recharge as he strives to prove the skeptics wrong.\u201cCome back in 12 months and watch how it\u2019s done,\u201d Milton said. \u201cI\u2019m an innovator, I\u2019ll let the haters hate.

Investors promptly bid up Hertz by 68 per cent.The car renter wants to take advantage of the quixotic rally in its stock by offering as many as 246.78 million common shares, according to a court filing. The proceeds would provide some much-needed working capital while Hertz tries to dig out from massive debts that forced it into court protection. Judge Mary Walrath set a hearing for later today to consider the idea.\u201cThis is what I love about bankruptcy \u2014 there\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with the law firm Otterbourg, who said she hasn\u2019t seen a financing like this.Hertz gained 41 per cent to US$2.90 at 10:47 a.m. in New York and rose as high as US$3.47. Investors are bidding up Hertz and other bankrupt companies on optimism that the economy and specifically air travel is poised to rebound. Hertz might also benefit from prices of used cars at auctions coming all the way back from a mid-April collapse.Hertz bankruptcy attorney Tom Lauria did not return an email seeking comment.Hertz based its request to the court on a nearly tenfold increase in its stock from 56 USc ents on May 26 to US$5.53 on Monday. While the stock has slid since then, Hertz said in the filing that a sale of shares still could help cover its debts.\u201cThe recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz\u2019s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity for the debtors to raise capital on terms that are far superior to any debtor-in-possession financing,\u201d the company said, referring to a traditional bankruptcy loan.Hertz said it would warn any potential buyers that \u201cthe common stock could ultimately be worthless\u201d and protect Jefferies LLC, the firm managing the potential sale, against lawsuits that could result from the offering.\u201cAs odd as it is, it might turn out to be brilliant move,\u201d said Bruce Grohsgal, a retired bankruptcy lawyer who teaches at Widener University\u2019s law school in Delaware.In the bankruptcy process, sometimes debt that seemed hopelessly out of the money can be repaid in full if business improves. If there\u2019s money left over, shareholders can get a recovery, too, Grohsgal said. That\u2019s possible in this case because of the unprecedented pandemic and potentially positive outcome when the pandemic eases, he said.Still, the new stock could be risky because in bankruptcy all debt \u2014 including Hertz\u2019 bonds trading Friday at less than half their face value \u2014 would have to be repaid in full before shareholders get a single cent.\u201cA lot of people would ask, what the heck is going on?\u201d Grohsgal said.Lawyers for Hertz requested an emergency ruling \u201cgiven the volatile state of trading in Hertz\u2019s stock.\u201d Hertz insiders sold shares during the recent rally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz disclosed earlier this week that New York Stock Exchange staff is starting proceedings to delist its stock. The company has appealed.While selling shares will let Hertz avoid the fees and interest payments of typical bankruptcy loans, that has to be weighed against the risk of a lawsuit, according to Cyganowski, the former bankruptcy judge.\u201cIt is incredibly creative and they get props for that, but I wouldn\u2019t buy those shares,\u201d said Nancy Rapoport, a professor at UNLV\u2019s William S. Boyd School of Law, who said she has never seen a bankruptcy funded this way. \u201cI guess they\u2019re trying to catch whatever the opposite of a falling knife is.\u201dThe case is The Hertz Corporation, 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Wethe and Joe Carroll", "title": "Chesapeake's demise marks end of shale model that changed the world", "description": "Financial reality has at long last caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chesapeakes-demise-marks-end-of-shale-model-that-changed-the-world", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/chesapeake-energy-corp..jpg", "publishedAt": "June 12, 2020 7:03 AM EDT", "content": "It will go down as wildest of the shale wildcatters, the overreaching pioneer of fracking techniques that minted vast fortunes and, now, has left behind ruin.At long last, financial reality has caught up with Chesapeake Energy Corp., avatar of the boom and subsequent bust of North American shale.Chesapeake\u2019s spiral toward oblivion accelerated this week with executives said to be preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing, signaling the imminent end of Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler\u2019s 7-year campaign to turn around the troubled gas explorer. For a company that\u2019s been skirting disaster for most of the past decade, the Covid-19-driven collapse in world energy prices merely added one more exclamation point to a tale of risk, hubris and debt.Chesapeake may be shale\u2019s biggest corporate casualty, but it is hardly the first \u2014 and won\u2019t be the last. Its self-inflicted wounds have sapped confidence across the entire industry, leaving many smaller operators teetering on the edge of catastrophe.As the remnants of shale\u2019s turn-of-the-century heyday turn to dust, it\u2019s unclear who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 will step into the void. Supermajors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. already have written off their own gas-heavy assets, and are instead focusing on oil-rich shale fields. But any shift in the global supply-and-demand balance for gas would prompt the most sophisticated giants to reassess the value of acquiring and drilling mothballed gas projects.Extreme PressureAlmost three dozen North American explorers, frackers and pipeline operators have fled to bankruptcy courts since the start of this year, buckling under $25.2 billion in cumulative debts, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. Chesapeake\u2019s indebtedness would swell that encumbrance by almost 40%.And even with crude prices recovering from the unprecedented April collapse into negative territory, energy-sector bankruptcies are expected to grow in coming months because many shale companies are in too far over their heads. \u201cExtreme financial pressure is being felt at all levels of the energy industry,\u201d Haynes and Boone said in a report.The template for the shale model that\u2019s now unraveling for many companies was established by Chesapeake and its late co-founder Aubrey McClendon.Experimental DrillingChesapeake was the brainchild of McClendon and his pal Tom Ward, who started out with $50,000 in borrowed money in rented offices. The company went public in 1993 and soon was experimenting with sideways drilling and hydraulic fracturing to pummel open shale formations previously regarded as impermeable \u2014 and therefore, worthless \u2014 by geologists.At the time, the outlook for domestic gas production was so grim that Alan Greenspan predicted the U.S. would need huge imports of liquefied gas to keep industries and furnaces running. Tens of billions of dollars were invested in massive new gas import terminals that were rendered obsolete before they even opened as Chesapeake and other shale drillers flooded the continent with gas.By the time Ward struck out on his own to form SandRidge Energy Inc. in 2006, Chesapeake was spending on average $1 billion a year to snap up drilling rights from Texas to Pennsylvania. At the start of 2007, Forbes magazine named Chesapeake the best managed oil and gas company.Grand AmbitionUnder McClendon, Chesapeake raised production more than 10-fold between 2000 and 2013, invested heavily in experimental natural gas-fueled transport, and even toyed with expanding overseas before its geologists concluded that many European shale formations were unsuitable for drilling.At its peak, Chesapeake pumped more American gas than anyone aside from Exxon and boasted a market valuation of almost $38 billion.The other side of that coin was that the company only generated positive cash flow in two out of the past 30 years. When gas output from newly tapped shale fields flooded markets and prices tumbled, Chesapeake had to scramble to find new investors or joint-venture partners to provide cash infusions. By 2012, the company\u2019s net debt load was twice the size of Exxon\u2019s, a company that had a market value 27 times larger. Chesapeake warned it was on the verge of running out of cash.While all of that was still brewing, little-known oil wildcatters like Harold Hamm were quietly adapting the technology McClendon and the other shale-gas innovators employed for use on crude-drenched rocks in North Dakota. Those breakthroughs reversed the terminal decline in U.S. crude production, turned America into an energy powerhouse and shattered OPEC\u2019s decades-long grip on the world\u2019s most important commodity.Double MagnumsWhen times were good, Chesapeake spared no expense recruiting young talent to Oklahoma City and a corporate headquarters modeled after an Ivy League university campus. In between stockpiling double magnums of Bordeaux and collecting antique speedboats, McClendon singlehandedly transformed the northwest side of the city from a rundown backwater to a bustling commercial corridor.But the good times never last forever. McClendon was ousted during an Icahn-led board revolt in 2013, and three years later he was indicted on federal bid-rigging charges. Just hours after vowing to fight the charges at all costs and clear his name, he died when his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a concrete highway abutment at 78 miles an hour along a desolate country road.\u201cThey were absolutely guns blazing with their growth, but it took a lot of money to do that,\u201d said Robert Clarke, research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at the ugly side of all that excess.\u201dGordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman, declined to comment for this story.Escape RoutesAlthough Lawler inherited many of the burdens that sank the company, the fateful 2019 takeover of WildHorse Resource Development Corp. that included the assumption of more than $900 million in debt was his own undertaking. The move \u2014 intended to pivot Chesapeake toward oil and away from gas \u2014 occurred just in time to expand the company\u2019s exposure to the crude-market collapse.In the end, Chesapeake ran out of escape routes from its $9.5 billion debt load. Gas prices were too low for too many years, and lenders and private-equity investors had long since shut the door on shale. That left asset sales as the sole avenue for raising cash, but in a market already drowning in a surfeit of gas, Lawler couldn\u2019t find buyers.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Claire Ballentine", "title": "Stocks rebound as investors focus on buying the dip over virus fears", "description": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-primed-for-losses-after-u-s-slide-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/stocks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 5:56 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rebounded from the biggest rout in 12 weeks as dip-buyers emerged for companies that bore the brunt of Thursday\u2019s selling.

Bookings reached a bottom in April and the first two weeks of May and have been improving since then, Rovinescu said Thursday.The company\u2019s shares were down 9.4 per cent to $17.67 at 12:20 p.m. in Toronto as global markets tumbled on concerns about a second wave of the pandemic, bringing their decline to about 63 per cent this year.In response to a comment that the border restrictions have worked out reasonably well, Rovinescu said: \u201cI can tell you one thing.

It will also let Amazon defend itself against the charges, the first and main opportunity to fight back against the EU case before officials rule on whether the company violated antitrust law.The world\u2019s biggest online retailer is one of several technology firms that have attracted the scrutiny of the EU\u2019s powerful competition watchdog. Regulators are wrestling with how to act against online giants that critics say run a rigged game when they set the rules for platforms that also host their rivals.EU officials have quizzed online merchants over the past year and a half to build a picture of how Amazon competes with its own sellers to win the \u201cbuy box\u201d on its website. The coveted designation determines which offer \u2014 whether from Amazon\u2019s own inventory, or that of a third-party merchant \u2014 is displayed to shoppers as the default option to buy a particular product.As the operator of the platform, Amazon controls a valuable trove of data of customer shopping habits and hit products, information that can help it jump ahead of smaller sellers. It\u2019s also increasingly pushing its own line of private-label products, and critics have highlighted cases in which Amazon appeared to roll out copies of bestsellers offered by others. The Wall Street Journal in April reported that some Amazon employees had examined individual seller data when designing in-house products \u2014 prompting sharp questions from U.S. lawmakers.Amazon also faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust probe in the U.S. But the EU investigation is further along and seen as Amazon\u2019s first big test amid widening global scrutiny of the power of U.S. tech firms.Online merchants \u201cexpect the EU to clearly punish\u201d Amazon for behavior they see as harmful, said Oliver Prothmann, the head of BVOH, the German association of online trade.\u201cAll merchants are certain that Amazon is using the merchants\u2019 data to make anti-competitive decisions for its own business,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAmazon has repeatedly caused merchants to be blocked\u201d without proper warning, he said.Amazon declined to comment, referring to a statement last year pledging to \u201ccooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\u201d Amazon has also said private-label products represent about 1 per cent of its retail sales and that its policies prohibit the teams developing Amazon products from using data from individual sellers.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the EU would send a statement of objections next week or the week after. The commission\u2019s press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.EU antitrust probes haven\u2019t always opened the way to more competition. Google\u2019s smaller rivals complain that the company hasn\u2019t had to cede much despite a decade of EU probes and $9 billion in penalties.Regulators are looking for new antitrust powers that could order changes without fines and are seeking rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.Google, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have also attracted fresh EU attention over how they might push users to their own services over competitors.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Charles Capel", "title": "Elon Musk weighs in on Tesla's stock again, this time with 'lol' and an internet meme", "description": "As Tesla share price soars, Musk tweeted a reference to an internet meme generally used to ridicule the stock market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/elon-musk-tesla-stock-tweet-lol-meme", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/elon-musk-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 11, 2020 9:48 AM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc. shares have been soaring in the weeks since Elon Musk said he thought they were too high.
