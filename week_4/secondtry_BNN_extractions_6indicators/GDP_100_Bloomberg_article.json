Only a single sector - utilities - managed to eke out grrowth in the month. It was a historically weak handoff for the first quarter and there's no escaption the economic pain has only gotten worse since then. Statistics Canada gave a preliminary snapshot of what happenef last month; it's estimating GDP sank 11 per cent in April.\u00a0 \n IN CONVERSATION WITH RBC'S CEO \n Dave McKay joins Amanda at 1 p.m. ET for a deep dive on the quarter that saw Canada\u2019s largest bank set aside $2.8 billion for loans that could go bad and what comes next as governments wrestle with the challenges of reopening their economies. \n FORD PUTS LONG-TERM CARE COMPANIES ON NOTICE \n We\u2019ll get industry perspective today after Ontario Premier urged investors to speak up and threatened to yank licences in the aftermath of the Canadian Armed Forces\u2019 report on abhorrent conditions in five long-term care facilities. The chief executive of Chartwell Retirement Residences (which, it must be pointed out, is not involved with the five properties that were the focus of the CAF report) joins Amanda at 1:20 p.m. ET Don\u2019t miss it. \n TRUMP VERSUS\u00a0TWITTER \n Less than 12 hours after the White House confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump had signed an executive order that could expose social media platforms to greater liability risk and regulatory scrutiny, Twitter once again  tagged one of his tweets.  This time, for glorifying violence in a tweet early today that warns the military is ready to step in amid violence in Minnesota (\u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d he wrote). \n CANOPY GROWTH DISAPPOINTS \n The big Canadian pot producer's shares came under pressure in pre-market trading after it yanked its previous targets for becoming profitable while warning investors that fiscal 2021 will be a \"transition year\". The company also reported a fourth-quarter net loss that ballooned to $1.3 billion amid impairments, restructuring charges, and a 13 per cent\u00a0sequential decline in net revenue. \n CANADIAN BANK CUTS DIVIDEND. REALLY.  \n Laurentian Bank of Canada has dared to do what almost never happens in its peer group by cutting its dividend. As of August, the quarterly payout will be slashed 40 per cent\u00a0to 40 cents per share. Its CEO said it\u2019s a prudent move that will support its strategic growth and shore up its balance sheet. We\u2019ll see how it goes over with investors. \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -CannTrust Holdings announced Health Canada has reinstated its licence for the Fenwick harvesting facility in Ontario's Niagara region. The embattled cannabis producer, which is currently in CCAA, said it will immediately restart operations at Fenwick; however, the licence for its Vaughan manufacturing facility is still suspended and so it can't estimate when its products will hit the market. \n -Aritzia  said late yesterday  its ecommerce revenue has surged more than 150 per cent\u00a0year-over-year since it shuttered stores in mid-March as lockdown measures took effect.

Economists had anticipated a 10 per cent\u00a0decline. The agency also released preliminary estimates for April that show an 11 per cent\u00a0plunge in output, versus the 7.2 per cent\u00a0drop in March when coronavirus restrictions were first imposed halfway through the month. \n As bad as the numbers are, the better-than-expected data suggest the country may be able to avoid the most dire scenarios, helped by a flood of government transfers into the economy. \n \u201cOverall, the economy has likely troughed at least for now, with businesses beginning to reopen,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors. \u201cLook for the economic data to begin showing signs of revival over the summer months, even if it only represents the low-hanging fruit of eased restrictions.\u201d \n \n The second quarter likely won\u2019t be worse than the 40 per cent\u00a0annualized decline that CIBC is forecasting, Mendes said. \n According to Bank of Montreal\u2019s Doug Porter, Canada\u2019s first quarter contraction is right in the middle of the pack among Group of Seven countries, better than all three\u00a0Eurozone\u00a0countries but worse than the U.S., Japan and the U.K. \n \u201cThe new news here is that the figures were a little less dire than feared,\u201d Porter said in a report. \n The historic decline in the first half of 2020 has been anticipated. The focus is shifting to how quickly and to what extent the economy will recover. Most economists expect a slow recovery as long as consumers remain hesitant to resume normal activities, at least until a vaccine is available. \n The Canadian dollar was little changed after the report, trading at $1.3768 against the U.S. dollar at 9:12 a.m. in Toronto trading. Two-year government bond yields dropped 2 basis points to 0.29 per cent. \n Spending Stalls \n Friday\u2019s report showed the downturn was broad-based, with household spending falling nine per cent\u00a0annualized, the most on record. The drop in consumption accounted for 5 percentage points of the 8.2% annualized drop. Businesses scaling back inventories accounted for another 2 percentage points. \n The pullback from the consumer was also evident in a surge in the savings rate to 6.1 per cent\u00a0in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the highest since 2001. \n Even though hundreds of thousands of Canadians lost jobs in the first quarter, household disposable income was up, reflecting an increase in government transfers. Canadians didn\u2019t spend those transfers however, putting them toward savings. \n Non-residential business investment came in much stronger than expected, recording just a 2.7 per cent\u00a0annualized drop in the first quarter -- a better performance than the previous three months when it dropped 4.8%. There was little impact on housing investment, which was little changed in the first quarter. \n Government spending was weaker, posting a 3.8 per cent\u00a0annualized drop, the most since 2013, from school closures and curtailed government administration. Exports were also hit considerably in the first quarter, recording an 11.3 per cent\u00a0annualized drop. But the impact of trade on growth was largely offset by a 10.7 per cent\u00a0drop in imports. \n --With assistance from\u00a0Erik Hertzberg. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": null, "title": "China abandons hard growth target, shifts stimulus focus to jobs", "description": "The Chinese government abandoned its decades-long practice of setting an annual target for economic growth amid the storm of uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, and said it would continue to increase stimulus.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-abandons-hard-growth-target-shifts-stimulus-focus-to-jobs-1.1439675", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 21, 2020", "content": "The Chinese government abandoned its decades-long practice of setting an annual target for economic growth amid the storm of uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, and said it would continue to increase stimulus. \n Speaking Friday morning at the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing, Premier Li Keqiang delivered an annual policy address that laid out a renewed focus on maintaining employment and investment. Against a backdrop of escalating tensions with the U.S., Li said Beijing remains committed to implementing the terms of the \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal. \n With more than US$500 billion in infrastructure bonds to be issued this year and more monetary easing on the horizon, China is trying to cement a fragile domestic recovery without indulging in the kind of\u00a0debt blowouts\u00a0seen in the U.S. and Europe. The world\u2019s largest exporter is therefore still reliant on other countries reining in the pandemic and on a reboot of global trade. \n \u201cWe have not set a specific target for economic growth this year,\u201d Li said, speaking in the Great Hall of the People. \u201cThis is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment.\u201d \n Shifting away from a hard target for output growth breaks with decades of\u00a0Communist Party planning habits\u00a0and is an admission of the deep rupture the pandemic has caused. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect China\u2019s economy to expand just 1.8 per cent\u00a0this year, its worst performance since the 1970s. \n At the same time, Li gave a precise figure for the targeted budget deficit, widening it to more than 3.6 per cent\u00a0of gross domestic product. Including the issuance of special bonds, that brings a broader measure of the deficit to more than eight per cent, according to Bloomberg Economics. \n Analysts including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Yu Song said the package was less aggressive than expected. Market sentiment was overshadowed by the announcement Friday that Beijing would impose national security legislation on Hong Kong, risking further confrontation with the U.S. \n The CSI 300 Index fell 2.3 per cent\u00a0on Friday, its worst reaction to the opening of the country\u2019s annual National People\u2019s Congress since the stock benchmark started in 2005. \n What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say... \n \u201cSetting a target in such an uncertain economic environment would have been risky. Abandoning the decades-long tradition relieves the government of the straitjacket the annual target placed on economic policy. The challenge now will be to effectively guide expectations in the absence of the GDP target.\u201d \n Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics \n Li said the government is setting a target for urban job creation of more than 9 million jobs, lower than the 2019 target of around 11 million, and a target for the urban surveyed unemployment rate of around six per cent, higher than 2019\u2019s goal, according to the document. \n The government\u2019s official measures don\u2019t capture the full extent of unemployment caused by the pandemic, which has hit both manufacturing and services hard. With jobs and income growth vital for the unelected Communist Party\u2019s political legitimacy, stabilizing employment has become Li\u2019s first priority. \n \u201cWe will make every effort to stabilize and expand employment,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will strive to keep existing jobs secure, work actively to create new ones, and help unemployed people find work.\u201d \n Reflecting recent controversy over the \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal with the U.S. signed earlier this year, before the pandemic broke out, Li said China will work with the U.S. to implement the agreement. \n The wider budget deficit target implies a significantly larger shortfall than 2019\u2019s target of 2.8 per cent. Greater spending on efforts to restart the economy and control the spread of coronavirus will be funded by issuing 1 trillion yuan (US$140 billion) in sovereign debt. \n To help finance infrastructure investment, local governments will issue 3.75 trillion yuan in local special bonds this year, up from 2019\u2019s quota of 2.15 trillion. Economists had forecast issuance of as much as 4 trillion yuan. \n The government\u2019s language on monetary policy was kept basically unchanged, with the stance remaining \u201cprudent,\u201d as well as \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cappropriate.\u201d The English-language report said new monetary policy tools would be developed to \u201cdirectly stimulate the real economy.\u201d \n \u201cIt is crucial that we take steps to ensure enterprises can secure loans more easily and promote steady reduction of interest rates,\u201d according to the report. Li added that money supply will be guided \u201csignificantly\u201d higher this year and that reserve ratios and interest rates will continue to be cut. \n Key leaders sat in two rows behind Li\u2019s podium, well spaced and without face masks. Officials behind were more closely packed and wearing masks, as were the hundreds listening in the hall. The Congress represents the centerpiece of China\u2019s political calendar, though it has a rubber-stamp role. The meeting was delayed more than two months by the virus shutdowns. \n Li detailed measures including continued implementation of VAT cuts, and a further 500 billion yuan in tax and fee reductions. The target for consumer price inflation was set at 3.5 per cent, higher than the usual ceiling and a reflection of continued high food-price gains. \n Analysts said\u00a0that while more stimulus was announced, the government\u2019s ambitions for growth remain limited given the dangers of another run up in debt. China borrowed heavily to stabilize the economy after the 2008 crisis, and is taking a markedly different tack this time. At the same time, rising unemployment may force the government\u2019s hand. \n \u201cI think the central government would like local governments to play a much more active role in relieving domestic unemployment and boosting domestic consumption,\u201d Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University, said Friday on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe problem is, local governments are indebted\u00a0up to\u00a0their eyebrows. There\u2019s really not much room for them significantly to increase debt.\u201d \n --With assistance from\u00a0Miao Han,\u00a0Lin Zhu,\u00a0Yinan Zhao,\u00a0Michelle Jamrisko,\u00a0Jiyeun Lee\u00a0and\u00a0Michael S.

If you missed it, check out this  great interview  with a seasoned trader from the immediate aftermath yesterday afternoon.\u00a0Sticking with central banks for a moment: the European Central Bank left rates unchanged this morning and said it\u2019s \u201cfully prepared\u201d to boost its pandemic emergency purchase programme\u00a0as needed. \n RENT DEADLINE LOOMS \n With a day to go until the next wave of rent payments are due, an ominous sign this morning from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business: it released a survey showing only 10 per cent\u00a0of small biz owners say they qualify for the program and expect their landlords to participate. Can\u2019t underscore this enough: the feds\u2019 plan places everyone completely at the mercy of the property owner\u2019s willingness to participate. We\u2019re looking forward to stakeholder insight today when Indigo\u00a0 Books & Music CEO Heather Reisman joins Jon Erlichman at 10:40 a.m. ET (will be curious to hear what she has to say since the program is targeted at small businesses). And Allied Properties REIT CEO Michael Emory joins Amanda Lang shortly after 1 p.m. ET. Don\u2019t miss them. \n INVESTORS PUNISH SHELL \n How quickly the narrative changes. Yesterday, we were reporting on how investors had been greeting dividend cuts in the energy sector with a shrug. Today, Royal Dutch Shell shares are under pressure after the supermajor  slashed its quarterly dividend  66 per cent\u00a0to US$0.16/share, with CEO Ben van Beurden saying the pre-existing payout was \u201cnot prudent.\u201d The news came alongside a 46 per cent\u00a0plunge in adjusted first-quarter profit. Our Bloomberg partners point out that at the end of January, van Beurden said \u201cI think lowering the dividend is not a good lever to pull if you want to be a world-class investment case, so we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -Cargill  says  it\u2019s preparing to resume operations at its High River plant in Alberta that was temporarily shutdown as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak that at last count tallied 821 cases. One shift of employees will be back on the job Monday. \n -Precision Drilling CEO Kevin Neveu said in a release this morning his company is expecting \u201ca significant and sustained reduction in customer demand for oil and gas services well into next year.\u201d As a result, he stated his company \u201cwill actively pursue any additional cash generating opportunities within the organization.\u201d The cautious tone came along a 13 per cent\u00a0drop in first-quarter revenue and a swing to a net loss in the period. \n -Tesla CEO Elon Musk teed off on pandemic lockdown measures during a conference call with analysts late yesterday: \u201c\u2026to say that [people] cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.

The region stands to lose its growth patron. \n China's gross domestic product fell 6.8 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the government said Friday, the worst performance since at least 1992. Even before this dismal result, the International Monetary Fund predicted Asia would see zero growth this year. \n Even flatlining sounds optimistic when you consider the role China played nursing the region through the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 and the Great Recession a decade later. During the former, China was still booming, on its way to becoming the factory of the world and its biggest exporter. Investment was pouring in as membership to the World Trade Organization beckoned. During the global financial crisis, China undertook massive stimulus that buttressed regional activity. The Asia Pacific region eked out an average growth rate of 1.3 per cent during the Asian financial crisis and 4.7 per cent through the Great Recession. \n Now Beijing shows little appetite for budget-busting stimulus. Its fiscal steps in response to the pandemic account for about 3 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics. That's tiny relative to the 10 per cent and 20 per cent unveiled by Washington and Tokyo, respectively. And while the central bank continues to nudge borrowing costs lower, its steps appear restrained compared with the array of tools being deployed around the world. \n What explains this reluctance? China turned to open-slather spending after the global financial crisis. That spree fueled a rebound and buttressed Asia, but it also saddled banks and companies with huge debts. Total debt to GDP, including the financial sector, ballooned to about 300 per cent in 2019 from about 173 per cent in 2008, according to the Institute of International Finance. \n All this means the rest of the region can't expect much to trickle through. \u201cChina won't bail out Asia this time,\u201d Changyong Rhee, director of the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department, said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television. \n China may well end up doing more if the recovery scenarios look to be in doubt. The IMF predicts 1.2 per cent growth for the full year, rising to 9.2 per cent in 2021. Keep in mind, too, there's often a lot of padding in stimulus packages elsewhere, with tax incentives and grants included in attention-grabbing headlines. This is particularly true of Japan, where money that hasn\u2019t been distributed previously often gets thrown in. \n Before the pandemic, China largely succeeded in pulling back some of the practices that fueled its debt buildup, which naturally led to slower growth. But few observers were ready for very low single-digit numbers \u2014 the kind not out of place in the U.S. or Europe \u2014 to come so soon. Among the scenarios the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development sketched out for the world in 2060 was the prospect that growth rates in the U.S. and China would start converging in 2030, averaging at just under 2 per cent a year. The report was written in 2018. The coronavirus will only bring forward this outcome. \n China's transformation over the past four decades from Mao-era basket case to the world's second-largest economy has been a vital ingredient in Asia's rise, especially after Japan's ascent stalled in the early 1990s. To say the COVID-19 pandemic halted this in its tracks is an understatement. China's future has arrived, and Asia will be the weaker for it. \n This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Liberals ease access to CERB, workers making $1,000 or less now eligible", "description": "OTTAWA -- The federal government is loosening the eligibility criteria for emergency federal pandemic aid to cover seasonal workers without jobs and workers whose hours have been drastically cut but who still have some income.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/liberals-ease-access-to-cerb-workers-making-1-000-or-less-now-eligible-1.1421785", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Apr 15, 2020", "content": "OTTAWA -- The federal government is loosening the eligibility criteria for emergency federal pandemic aid to cover seasonal workers without jobs and workers whose hours have been drastically cut but who still have some income. \n The details announced this morning will allow people who are making up to $1,000 a month to qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for COVID-19. \n And those whose employment insurance benefits have recently run out will also qualify for the $2,000-a-month benefit. \n Some six million people have applied for the help since the middle of ,when businesses were ordered closed and workers to stay at home as a public health precaution. \n For those doing jobs deemed essential, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government will top up their pay to encourage them to keep going into work during the health and economic crisis. \n \n \n \n ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN \n  BoC sees risk of 'structural damage,' ramps up bond-buying   \n  National shutdown to last weeks longer, Trudeau says \n  Trudeau bats away WHO questions, says Canada focused on COVID-19 \n \n \n \n Preliminary data from Statistics Canada Wednesday showed economic activity collapsed in March as it dropped a record nine per cent. \n If conditions improve quickly, the economic shock is likely to be \"abrupt and deep, but relatively short-lived\" and followed by a strong rebound for most, but not all, sectors of the economy. \n A more severe scenario would likely see a \"significant number\" of businesses closing for good and longer spells of unemployment as workers look for new jobs. \n A longer downturn would also mean households, businesses and governments could have higher debt by the time the recovery takes hold. \n No matter the scenario, all the possibilities suggest \"the near-term downturn will be the sharpest on record,\" the report reads. \n \"The outlook is highly conditional on how long the containment measures remain in place, and how households and firms adapt,\" governor Stephen Poloz said in his opening remarks during a morning teleconference. \n He added that \"substantial monetary stimulus needed to be in place to lay the foundation for the post-containment economic recovery.\" \n \n \n \n HAVE YOUR SAY \n \n \n \n   \n Do you share Stephen Poloz\u2019s optimism that Canada\u2019s economy will avoid worst-case structural damage? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1421891 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Yes',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'No',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada ekes out meager growth in January before pandemic", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy expanded less than expected in January even before the pandemic caused a virtual shutdown, reinforcing views the first quarter will be weak.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-ekes-out-meager-growth-in-january-before-pandemic-1.1415154", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 31, 2020", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy expanded less than expected in January even before the pandemic caused a virtual shutdown, reinforcing views the first quarter will be weak. \n Gross domestic product rose 0.1 per cent\u00a0from December, missing economist estimates for a 0.2\u00a0per cent\u00a0gain, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.

That was down from a revised 1.1\u00a0per cent pace in the previous quarter, making it the second-straight quarterly deceleration and slowest pace of growth since 2016. \n The period ended on a higher note than most analysts anticipated with a monthly expansion of 0.3\u00a0per cent in December, the fastest pace of growth since May. This brings the annual growth rate of Canada\u2019s real GDP to 1.6 per cent for 2019, down from two per cent\u00a0in 2018, and lower than the U.S., which posted a 2.3\u00a0per cent increase in real GDP, the agency said. \n \n The Canadian dollar was down 0.4\u00a0per cent to $1.3438 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:37 a.m. Toronto time. Bets that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates at the March 4 meeting rose to more than 50 per cent, from 36\u00a0per cent on Thursday. \n Key Insights \n -The slowdown in the fourth quarter was largely expected as a series of temporary factors including a week-long rail strike, manufacturing plant disruptions and pipeline shutdowns stunted growth. The quarter started off weak with most of the temporary factors occurring during the first two months of the period. And while December recouped some of the losses, this still doesn\u2019t change the picture that Canada\u2019s economy remains in a fragile position and the Bank of Canada could cut rates, especially in light of the recent impacts from the coronavirus and domestic rail disruptions \n -The saving grace for the economy was household spending, -- a reflection of a strong labor market -- up two per cent annualized on the quarter. But Canadians are largely buying non-durable goods and services -- which suggests they may be wary of big ticket items. Another indicator of caution is that the household savings rate rose to three per cent in the fourth quarter \n -Businesses had a tough quarter, perhaps reflecting the heightened global trade tensions at the end of the year. The drop in exports was the biggest downward contributor to 4Q output, falling 5.1\u00a0per cent annualized, the biggest drop since 2017. Business investment contracted three\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the fourth quarter after an 8.4\u00a0per cent expansion in the prior quarter. Investment in machinery and equipment fell 13.5\u00a0 \n Get More \n -Supply chain disruptions drove business inventories higher in 4Q, contributing 0.6% to the annualized growth rate. This suggests that if businesses had chosen not to increase inventories, the economy would have contracted. This could potentially drag on 2020 growth if firms decide to meet demand by drawing down stockpiles. \n -Residential investment decelerated to an annualized pace of 1.1\u00a0per cent in the fourth quarter from 13\u00a0per cent in the prior quarter. Non-residential investment shrunk by an annualized 6.3 per cent, more than offsetting the pickup in capital spending in the third quarter \n -Overall, domestic demand -- which excludes the trade sector and inventories -- remained sluggish, growing at just 0.7\u00a0per cent on an annualized basis \n -The housing market softened in the 4Q as investment in new construction decelerated \n -Third quarter GDP was revised down to an annualized 1.1 per cent, from an initial estimate of 1.3 per cent \n --With assistance from\u00a0Erik Hertzberg. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Statistics Canada expected to report lower fourth-quarter GDP figures", "description": "OTTAWA -- The latest reading on the how the Canadian economy fared at the end of last year is due out this morning and it's expected to show that growth slowed to a crawl for the final three months of 2019.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/statistics-canada-expected-to-report-lower-fourth-quarter-gdp-figures-1.1397341", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 28, 2020", "content": "OTTAWA -- The latest reading on the how the Canadian economy fared at the end of last year is due out this morning and it's expected to show that growth slowed to a crawl for the final three months of 2019. \n Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its reading on gross domestic product for December and the fourth quarter. \n Economists on average expect the agency to report that growth in the fourth quarter slowed to an annualized pace of 0.3 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv. \n Statistics Canada reported in November that real gross domestic product growth slowed to an annualized rate of 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of last year compared with a reading of 3.5 per cent in the second quarter. \n The GDP report comes amid worries about the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in China and its impact on the global economy and ahead of an interest rate announcement by the Bank of Canada next week. \n The central bank kept its key interest rate on hold in January, but left the door open to the possibility of rate cuts in the future if weakness in the economy was more persistent than it expected. \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "U.S. fourth-quarter GDP revisions show weaker underlying demand", "description": "Upwardly revised contributions from trade and inventories kept gross domestic product expanding at a solid 2.1 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching estimates for no revision of the initially reported rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-fourth-quarter-gdp-revisions-show-weaker-underlying-demand-1.1396709", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 27, 2020", "content": "Upwardly revised contributions from trade and inventories kept gross domestic product expanding at a solid 2.1 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching estimates for no revision of the initially reported rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. \n But consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, was revised down to a 1.7 per cent increase from 1.8 per cent, also matching forecasts.

Orders for commercial equipment excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- rose 1.1 per cent in January after an upwardly revised 0.5\u00a0per cent decrease. Even so, the coronavirus will test demand as well as supply chains. \n A key measure of underlying demand -- final sales to domestic purchasers -- rose an annualized 1.5\u00a0per cent in the fourth quarter, revised from an initially reported 1.6\u00a0per cent and the weakest in a year. \n Net exports contributed an upwardly revised 1.53 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth, while inventories dragged down the headline figure by 0.98 point, less than initially reported. \n A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits rose for a third week, though they remain low by historical standards. Jobless claims increased to 219,000 in the week ended Feb. 22, above economist forecasts. The\u00a0four-week average, a less-volatile measure,\u00a0edged up to 209,750. \n The claims figures tend to be more volatile around holidays. Last week included the Presidents Day holiday. \n The fourth-quarter GDP figures will be revised for a third and final time in March as additional data are compiled.

For now, however, the United Kingdom\u2019s separation from the European Union is largely a symbolic event due to an 11-month transition period during which time the two sides will seek agreements on thorny issues that will frame their future relationship (and as economist Simon French told Paul Bagnell this morning on The Street, the process will be tricky because the U.K. cannot be seen by the EU as having its cake and eating it, too). \n ANOTHER POT CEO OUT \n After Sundial Growers  cleaned house yesterday , David George-Cosh remarked on how a trend of management overhauls was taking hold in the pot sector. Today, we have another case study after MedMen Enterprises announced its CEO (and co-founder) Adam Bierman is stepping down as of tomorrow. Seems safe to say the decision was made abruptly seeing as how the pot retailer said its board is cobbling together a committee to hunt for his permanent successor. \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -Amazon.com Inc. is the stock to watch today as its shares surge almost 10 per cent\u00a0in pre-market trading after making a mockery of profit estimates late yesterday.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 2\u00a0per cent growth. \n Consumer spending decelerated to a 1.8\u00a0per cent pace, below projections and the weakest since the first quarter. Business investment declined for a third straight period, the longest stretch since the last recession. \n A closely watched gauge of underlying demand grew at the slowest rate of the year. So-called final sales to domestic purchasers, which exclude the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, expanded 1.6\u00a0per cent in the fourth quarter.

Nonetheless, healthy job creation, cheap borrowing costs and signs of stabilization in global manufacturing after trade agreements between the U.S. and its biggest trading partners suggest growth will hold up. \n Slower consumption growth is consistent with the message from Federal Reserve policy makers. The Fed, in a statement Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting, softened its characterization of household spending growth to \u201cmoderate\u2019\u2019 from \u201cstrong\u2019\u2019 as \u201cbusiness fixed investment and exports remain weak.\u2019\u2019 \n Fed Forecast \n The fourth-quarter GDP figures are consistent with the Fed\u2019s two\u00a0per cent\u00a0growth forecast for 2020, indicating policy makers can hold the line on interest rates after three reductions in 2019. \n Full-year GDP grew 2.3\u00a0per cent in 2019, slower than the 2.5\u00a0per cent in 2018. Economists expect growth to further moderate in 2020, as the waning effects of tax cuts and cooling wage gains make achieving Donald Trump\u2019s goal of sustained thre per cent\u00a0economic expansion difficult in the late-stage expansion. \n Business investment declined an annualized 1.5 per cent after falling at a 2.3\u00a0per cent\u00a0\u00a0pace in the previous three months. Spending on structures and equipment continued to weaken. \n At the same time, a pickup in home building helped soften the blow. Residential construction outlays increased at a 5.8\u00a0per cent rate, the strongest in two years and following a 4.6\u00a0per cent advance in the third quarter. \n Trade Boost \n A narrowing in the trade deficit -- largely due to a sharp drop in imports amid the U.S.-China trade war -- gave a significant boost to the main GDP number. Net exports added 1.48 percentage points to growth, the most since 2009. That helped to offset a 1.09 percentage point drag from inventories. \n Meanwhile, the Fed\u2019s preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.3\u00a0per cent annualized pace in the quarter, well below policy makers\u2019 two\u00a0per cent\u00a0objective. \n A separate Labor Department report out Thursday showed initial filings for unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 to 216,000 in the week ended Jan. 25.

Some of that may be due to the effects of Chinese New Year. That holiday is earlier this year than in 2019, and companies may have increased production in December ahead of a shutdown later this month. Retail sales rose eight per cent versus an estimate of 7.9 per cent. \n \u201cThe latest GDP and IP data provides a very positive start to the Chinese New Year for China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore. \u201cThe outlook for 2020 is for continued robust growth, boosted by the Phase One trade deal with the U.S. and the continued positive impact of government monetary and fiscal policy stimulus measures.\u201d \n The surveyed unemployment rate ticked\u00a0up to\u00a05.2\u00a0per cent in December from 5.1 per cent, signaling that the manufacturing-led slowdown in 2019 may be filtering through to the labor market. \n What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say... \n Stronger-than-expected activity in December points to further stabilization in early 2020. The signing of the \u2018phase-one\u2019 trade deal takes China out of the most turbulent waters, but it will hardly be smooth sailing ahead -- sizable U.S. tariffs will continue to weigh on the external sector, and sentiment is weak. \n Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics \n About 58\u00a0per cent of China\u2019s growth in 2019 was due to consumption, with investment adding 31\u00a0per cent and the remaining 11\u00a0per cent from net exports, Statistics Bureau head Ning Jizhe told journalists after the data was released Friday in Beijing. That contribution of consumption was lower than in 2018, indicating that efforts to rebalance the economy away from reliance on an investment-led model still have a way to go. \n One factor in that is likely to be the weak growth in incomes in 2019. Per capita incomes grew 5.8 per cent in the year, below the 6\u00a0per cent real growth of the economy. The slower growth in real incomes was partly due to higher inflation, according to Ning, who said he expects personal income and consumption to continue growing this year. \n Long-Run Uncertainty \n Policy makers have signaled they are prioritizing economic stability in 2020, with stimulus to be kept basically unchanged. Data released Thursday showed that overall credit growth held up in December and a\u00a0gauge of borrowing costs\u00a0fell, indicating that policy makers are beginning to see some progress in channeling credit to the economy. \n \u201cAll we can say is that China\u2019s economy is stabilizing. It\u2019s hard to forecast if the trend will continue in 2020 and if there will be a rebound,\u201d said Betty Wang, senior economist at Australia &New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cThe trade deal provided some short-term support for the economy, but there still exists great uncertainty in the long run.\u201d \n The number of births per 1000 people declined to 10.48, the lowest level on record according to National Bureau of Statistics data going back to 1949 when the Communist Party took power. China\u2019s working-age population -- thoseaged\u00a015 to 59 -- declined by 890,000, the figures released Friday showed. The number of newborns in 2019 fell to 14.65 million, a decrease of 580,000 from the year before. \n That underlines the longer-term challenges that the economy faces, from demographics to an increasingly heavy debt load. Policy settings agreed by the top leadership last month are due to be signed off by the nation\u2019s legislature in March. \n For now, officials remain wary of boosting monetary stimulus and are focusing on the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Economists see the growth target for 2020 being set at \u201cabout 6 per cent,\u201d signaling an acceptance of the long-term slowdown that the nation is on. \n December\u2019s data provides support to the argument that the current policy mix is the right one, according to Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. \n \u201cRetail sales growth were steady, indicating still pretty resilient consumers despite growing downward pressure on the labor market,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, together with the \u201cphase one\u201d deal, surely reduces the downside risks to the economy for 2020, offering comfort to\u00a0policy-makers to stick with a measured easing approach.\u201d \n --With assistance from\u00a0Tomoko Sato,\u00a0Lin Zhu\u00a0and\u00a0Kevin Hamlin. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Katia Dmitrieva and Vince Golle", "title": "U.S. seeks biggest change to economic-data releases in decades", "description": "The Trump administration plans to restrict the news media\u2019s ability to prepare advance stories on market-moving economic data, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could create a logjam in accessing figures such as the monthly jobs report.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-seeks-biggest-change-to-economic-data-releases-in-decades-1.1373898", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 14, 2020", "content": "The Trump administration plans to restrict the news media\u2019s ability to prepare advance stories on market-moving economic data, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could create a logjam in accessing figures such as the monthly jobs report. \n Currently, the Labor Department in Washington hosts \u201clockups\u201d for major reports lasting 30 to 60 minutes, where journalists receive the data in a secure room, write stories on computers disconnected from the internet, and transmit them when connections are restored at the release time. \n The department is looking at changes such as removal of computers from that room, and an announcement could come as soon as this week, said the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified. While the rationale was unclear, the government has cited security risks and unfair advantages for news media in prior changes to lockup procedures. \n Lockups, which are permitted but not required by government regulations, have been a mainstay for U.S. media for almost four decades. They have been designed to give reporters time to digest figures on market-moving data and make sure they are accurate before distributed en masse to the public. Statistics agencies and central banks in the U.K. and Canada use similar lockup procedures. \n The U.S. move would upend decades of practice, and media organizations including Bloomberg News and Reuters have challenged prior changes to procedures. The shift could also spur an arms race among high-speed traders to get the numbers first and profit off the data, raising questions about fairness in multitrillion-dollar financial markets. \n Michael Trupo, a spokesman for the Labor Department, didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. The Commerce Department -- which provides advance access to its reports such as gross domestic product and retail sales at the Labor-hosted lockups -- referred questions on the matter to Labor. \n Without news services transmitting their reports at the release time and allowing additional access points, the government may have to prepare its websites to handle potentially heavier loads under the new system, which could mean adding security measures or increasing the traffic capacity. \n \u201cThe details of economic data releases matter,\u201d said Bipan Rai, North America head of foreign-exchange strategy at CIBC. \u201cThe longer it takes to suss out the details post-release, the higher the chances that markets will whip around.\u201d \n Previous Plan \n In 2012, the Labor Department under the Obama administration sought to alter lockups to require journalists to use government-owned computers to write their stories. Officials at the time framed the change as addressing security risks. \n After protests from Bloomberg News and other news organizations, and a congressional hearing in which editors testified, the department agreed to allow the media to continue using their own equipment and data lines. Reporters are required to leave mobile phones and other electronic devices in lockers outside of the lockup room, along with personal effects such as umbrellas and purses. \n The Labor Department move would follow a\u00a0similar decision\u00a0by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2018 to scale back lockups covering farm products, particularly the closely-watched monthly crop forecasts that typically move markets in soybeans, corn and wheat. \n Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at the time that because of technological changes, journalists can now get information to their readers faster than the USDA can put it on its website, creating an unfair advantage. \n The USDA\u2019s releases since the change haven\u2019t been without hiccups: In November, for about six minutes after the release time, the website produced an error message. \n The Federal Reserve separately hosts its own media lockups where journalists get advance access to interest-rate decisions, meeting minutes and industrial-production data, and write their stories on computers in a secure room. \n Government Burden \n Without news services like Bloomberg News and Reuters transmitting their reports at the precise release time and allowing additional access points, the lockup changes put the burden on the government to ensure that its website remains accessible while being bombarded by everyone from algorithmic traders to the general public. \n U.S. government websites aren\u2019t immune from attack or technical issues that could limit public access. In 2013, the Obamacare website crashed when millions tried to access it and register under the then-new health care program, preventing Americans from enrolling in coverage until months later, after a frantic repair effort. \n Earlier this month, a pro-Iran group hacked a U.S. government website -- the Federal Depository Library Program -- and posted messages related to the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander. \n The Obama administration\u2019s Labor Department said in its November 2016\u00a0transition document\u00a0that it took \u201ccostly security measures\u201d including a technology upgrade to protect the data, and \u201csignificant personnel and financial resources are also required to host each lockup.\u201d \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's economy shrinks in October from auto strike spillover", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy contracted in October for the first time in eight months, as the United Auto Workers strike in the U.S. weighed on plant production.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-economy-shrinks-in-october-from-auto-strike-spillover-1.1366209", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 23, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy contracted in October for the first time in eight months, as the United Auto Workers strike in the U.S. weighed on plant production. \n Gross domestic output shrank 0.1 per cent\u00a0from the prior month, missing economist estimates for a flat reading, Statistics Canada reported Monday.

The prior estimate already reflected $6 billion in legal settlements with Facebook and Google. \n Excluding the typically volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 2.2\u00a0\u00a0per cent pace that was revised from 2 \u00a0per cent. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. \n Earlier this month, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected U.S. growth to cool to 1.6\u00a0\u00a0per cent in the final three months of the year before picking up slightly in 2020. At the same time, Boeing Co.\u2019s decision to pause production of the grounded 737 Max jet will reduce first-quarter growth by about a half percentage point, several analysts estimated this week. \n Inflation showed signs of a pickup in the third quarter though remains broadly muted. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, rose at an unrevised 2.1\u00a0\u00a0per cent annualized pace in the period, up from 1.9\u00a0\u00a0per cent in the previous quarter. \n Analysts project a year-over-year core inflation rate of 1.5\u00a0\u00a0per cent for November. The Federal Reserve targets two\u00a0per cent\u00a0annual inflation based on the index including all items though officials look at the core measure for a better sense of underlying price pressures. \n --With assistance from Kristy Scheuble. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: CN Rail CEO speaks out on strike; Canadian economy slows as expected", "description": "Noah Zivitz", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-cn-rail-ceo-speaks-out-on-strike-canadian-economy-slows-as-expected-1.1355184", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 29, 2019", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Canada's economy slowed precisely as expected in the third quarter.

That was down from a revised 3.5 per cent\u00a0pace in the previous quarter that was largely seen as unsustainable. The period also ended as expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.1\u00a0per cent in September. \n While the slowdown last quarter marks a return to sluggish growth for the Canadian economy, the details of the report should provide some optimism about underlying strength domestically, even in the face of a weak trade sector, aided by a relatively robust jobs market and a rebound in housing. \n Residential investment increased at an annualized pace of 13.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest since 2012. Growth in household consumption picked up to an annualized pace of 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, from 0.5\u00a0per cent\u00a0the previous quarter. \n Non-residential business investment also surprised -- given the global trade uncertainties -- with spending on non-residential structures and machinery up 9.5 per cent. That fully recouped a drop in the second quarter. \n \n The end result was a 3.2\u00a0per cent increase in overall domestic demand, fully rebounding from a very weak second quarter when consumption slowed and investment contracted. These underlying details should give Bank of Canada policy makers pause about cutting rates to counter an expected slowdown. Swaps trading suggests investors are placing a two-thirds chance of a rate cut in the first half of next year.

This suggests there was less slack in the economy than previously thought, one less reason for the Bank of Canada to cut. \n The biggest drag on the economy in the third quarter was a draw down in inventories by business to meet demand, instead of raising production. That\u2019s the second straight draw down in inventories, and may still reflect concerns about the outlook. \n At the same time, fewer inventories will ease worries that stockpiles had grown too large, posing a risk to future growth. \n Exports dropped at an annualized pace of 1.5\u00a0per cent in the third quarter, falling for a third time in the past four quarters. \n Households also seem to be repairing their balance sheets, with the country\u2019s savings rate jumping to the highest since 2015 in the third quarter. \n --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canada's economy faces a prolonged period of sluggish growth", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy is shifting into a lower gear as some of the country\u2019s growth drivers begin to lose steam.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-economy-faces-a-prolonged-period-of-sluggish-growth-1.1354812", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 28, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy is shifting into a lower gear as some of the country\u2019s growth drivers begin to lose steam. \n Statistics Canada will release third-quarter gross domestic product numbers Friday that will probably show a sharp drop in growth.

Next year doesn\u2019t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020. That\u2019s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January. \n Canada\u2019s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they\u2019ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3\u00a0 per cent\u00a0since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased one per cent\u00a0in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal. \n Business investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent\u00a0since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures. \n \n Consumption has long propelled Canada\u2019s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that\u2019s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigor is most apparent in a retail sector that\u2019s seen volumes flat over the past year. \n \u201cYou don\u2019t have a domestic demand story that\u2019s strong,\u201d said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. \n One bright spot in the GDP numbers could be housing, which has rebounded as borrowing costs decline and buyers adjust to tighter mortgage rules. Home sales rose 7.3 per cent\u00a0in the third quarter, the fastest quarterly pace since the end of 2017.

While that exceeded analyst projections for no change, it was the weakest gain since February and reflected a drop in auto demand. \n \n Inflation-adjusted disposable income fell 0.3 per cent, the most since 2015, though that was due to declines in interest and farm income, while wages and salaries posted a solid increase of 0.4 per cent. \n The figures indicate a more-tempered pace of household spending heading into the key holiday-shopping day known as Black Friday.

In addition, jobless claims tend to be volatile around the year-end holidays, partly because of difficulties adjusting for seasonal swings. \n In a positive sign Wednesday, the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index\u2019s gauge of buying conditions in the U.S. advanced last week to 55.3, the highest ever leading up to the first shopping day after the Thanksgiving holiday.

For businesses, nonresidential fixed investment fell the most since late 2015. \n Final sales to domestic purchasers rose an annualized two per cent\u00a0after 3.6 per cent\u00a0in the previous three months, signaling a moderation in underlying demand. \n The growth figures come just hours before Federal Reserve officials are expected to announce a third-straight interest-rate cut to support the expansion and ahead of Friday's jobs report, which economists project will show hiring slowed further. Signs of stabilization may be a welcome sign for President Donald Trump as he campaigns on his economic record, though his trade war with China and faltering global growth have weighed on the expansion. \n INVESTMENT, EXPORTS \n The report's composition showed a second-straight contraction in nonresidential investment, which fell an annualized three per cent after declining one per cent\u00a0in the second quarter. Net exports were a slight drag on the expansion, subtracting 0.08 percentage point from growth as inventories also weighed slightly. Federal spending drove a gain in government consumption. \n The report on GDP, the broadest measure of all goods and services, isn\u2019t likely to swing the Fed\u2019s rate decision as officials close a two-day meeting, though they may see greater consumer strength as an important sign that the economy is weathering sluggishness from overseas markets. \n The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to three per cent, the lowest since the financial crisis, as signs of stress menace economies from China to Europe. U.S. goods-trade figures this week showed exports and imports both fell in September to the lowest levels in more than a year. \n As the longest U.S. expansion on record shows more signs of cooling, in part because of the fading effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus, different parts of the world's largest economy are giving mixed signals. \n DISPOSABLE INCOMES \n The unemployment rate has fallen to a half-century low, underpinning consumers and keeping sentiment readings near historical highs.

Companies, including oil and gas exploration firms, have reined in capital outlays to preserve shareholder value. \n The weakness in business investment was led by structures and equipment, which both dropped the most in more than three years.

The rebound follows two straight quarters of hardly any growth. The period also ended better than expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.2 per cent in June. \n The underlying details, however, were less impressive. The rebound was driven by the fastest quarterly increase in exports since 2014, but growth in household consumption came to a near halt despite strong gains in incomes, and business investment shrank by the most in more than two years.

The strong gain in exports, meanwhile, is seen as only temporary, reflecting a ramping up of shipments after a sluggish winter. Exports had slumped sharply earlier this year because of curtailments on oil production and other temporary issues, prompting many businesses to stockpile. \n DePratto said he expects the Bank of Canada to join the global trend toward easing monetary policy in October, an increasingly likely scenario according to swaps trading. A second cut is being priced in by investors sometime next year. The next rate decision is Sept. 4, when policy makers aren\u2019t expected to move but will likely strike a more dovish tone. Friday\u2019s GDP numbers beat the bank\u2019s 2.3 per cent forecast, and economists had predicted a 3 per cent increase. \n The stronger-than-expected headline figure boosted the Canadian dollar. The loonie was up 0.2 per cent to $1.3255 per U.S. dollar at 10:04 a.m. in Toronto. \n \n \u2018Solid Increase\u2019 \n Despite the worrying details, the Canadian economic expansion in the second quarter was still impressive -- growing the most in two years at easily the fastest pace in the Group of Seven. The U.S. economy expanded by an annualized 2 per cent over the same period. \n Shipments by Canadian exporters rose at a 13 per cent pace, contributing more than 4 percentage points to growth. A drop in imports also added to the expansion, as more of the nation\u2019s demand was used to buy domestically produced goods and services. \n Housing investment, meanwhile, recorded its first gain in six quarters. \n It\u2019s the sort of data that make the case for cheaper money less compelling in Canada than it is elsewhere. Even two cuts over the next 12 months will still leave the country with the highest policy rate among advanced economies. \n \u201cThe solid increase in the headline numbers leaves our call intact for the Bank of Canada to remain patient on cutting rates for the next few month,\u201d said Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which expects a cut in January. \n --With assistance from\u00a0Erik Hertzberg \n \n \n \n WEIGH IN  \n \n \n \n   \n Do you think Canada\u2019s economy is as strong as the second-quarter 3.7% headline suggests? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1309252 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Yes',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'No',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Jeff Kearns", "title": "U.S. second-quarter growth revised down to 2% pace from 2.1%", "description": "U.S. economic growth decelerated in the second quarter by more than initially reported, with stronger consumer spending offset by weaker readings across other categories that suggest President Donald Trump's trade actions are weighing more heavily on the pace of expansion.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-second-quarter-growth-revised-down-to-2-pace-from-2-1-1.1308605", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Aug 29, 2019", "content": "U.S. economic growth decelerated in the second quarter by more than initially reported, with stronger consumer spending offset by weaker readings across other categories that suggest President Donald Trump's trade actions are weighing more heavily on the pace of expansion. \n Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a two per cent\u00a0annualized rate, according to Commerce Department data Thursday that matched analyst estimates and compared with an initially reported 2.1 per cent.

What's more, revisions from July showed GDP grew 2.5 per cent on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis last year, down from a prior estimate of three per cent. \n Thursday's report underscored the extent to which consumers can help sustain an expansion that's wobbling elsewhere. The composition of the revision showed that personal consumption expenditures, the biggest driver of growth in the period, contributed 3.1 percentage points to GDP growth after an initially reported 2.85 points. \n Net exports subtracted 0.72 point, more than the initial drag of 0.65 point, while nonresidential fixed investment remained a slight drag. \n That may point to the impact of Trump's tariffs as companies delay investment and potentially begin passing higher costs along to consumers. \n Excluding the trade and inventory components of GDP, which remained the main drags on the second quarter after giving a big boost in the first, final\u00a0sales\u00a0to domestic purchasers increased at an upwardly-revised 3.6 per cent\u00a0pace. This measure, often looked to by economists as a gauge of underlying demand, suggests growth in the quarter was stronger than the headline number suggests. \n Real Estate \n Housing contracted for a sixth-straight quarter with an even bigger drag. Residential investment shrank at a 2.9 per cent\u00a0pace that was initially reported as a 1.5\u00a0per cent drop. \n The report also gave the first read on business earnings in the quarter. Pretax corporate profits climbed 5.3% from the prior quarter, the most in five years, and 2.7\u00a0per cent annually. \n A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits held steady. Jobless claims rose by 4,000 to 215,000 in the week ended Aug. 24, about in line with forecasts and the four-week moving average. \n The labor market has remained a bright spot for the economy, with unemployment near a half-century low and wage gains holding up. Next week's jobs report is projected to show payroll gains of around 160,000 in August, roughly in line with the prior reading but below last year's 223,000 average. \n Get More \n \n Gross domestic income, adjusted for inflation, rose 2.1 per cent, following 3.2\u00a0per cent in the first quarter. \n Inflation remained subdued, as the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.7\u00a0per cent pace that was revised from 1.8 per cent. \n Government spending contributed 0.77 point after a previously reported 0.85 point. \n Travel was the largest contributor to the downward revision to exports of services, which fell 6.3\u00a0per cent. \n The GDP report is the second of three estimates for the quarter; the third is due Sept. 26. \n \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Week Ahead: Bank earnings continue; Canadian GDP report", "description": "Noah Zivitz", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-week-ahead-bank-earnings-continue-canadian-gdp-report-1.1306087", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Aug 23, 2019", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n BNN Bloomberg sets up the week ahead with what investors need to know. \n Monday, August 26 \n -Notable data: U.S. durable goods orders \n -G7 summit wraps up in Biarritz, France \n Tuesday, August 27 \n -Notable earnings: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia \n -Notable data: S&P/Case Shiller U.S. home price index \n Wednesday, August 28 \n -Notable earnings: National Bank, Tiffany & Co.\u00a0 \n -Deadline for Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario cannabis retail lottery winners to formally apply for licence \n Thursday, August 29 \n -Notable earnings: Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Western Bank, Laurentian Bank, BRP, Best Buy, Dollar Tree, Dollar General \n -Notable data: Canadian current account balance, U.S. GDP \n Friday, August 30 \n -Notable earnings: Campbell Soup \n -Notable data: Canadian GDP, U.S. personal income and spending \n Saturday, September 1 \n -First round of new U.S. and China tariffs take effect Sept. 1 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Canada's GDP grows 0.2% in May, as manufacturing rebounds", "description": "The Canadian economy expanded for a third-straight month in May on increases in manufacturing and construction, reinforcing the view the central bank can remain on the sidelines for now.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-gdp-grows-0-2-in-may-as-manufacturing-rebounds-1.1295071", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jul 31, 2019", "content": "The Canadian economy expanded for a third-straight month in May on increases in manufacturing and construction, reinforcing the view the central bank can remain on the sidelines for now. \n Gross domestic product rose 0.2 per cent, after a 0.3\u00a0per cent gain in April, Statistics Canada said Wednesday from Ottawa.

That follows an unrevised 3.1 per cent advance in first quarter and updated data showing growth last year was slower than previously reported. \n Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, increased 4.3 per cent, while government spending climbed 5 per cent and offered the biggest boost in a decade. Nonresidential investment fell 0.6 per cent for the first drop since 2015 and residential decreased for a sixth straight period. \n The mixed report highlights how President Donald Trump -- who's repeatedly called for lower interest rates -- is enjoying signs of a solid economy while his trade war with China weighs on the expansion and fuels uncertainty for global businesses. Revised data released Friday showed the economy missed Trump's 3 per cent growth goal in 2018, after previous data had showed it matching. \n Friday\u2019s report showed fresh evidence that trade is weighing on the expansion as exports dropped 5.2 per cent while imports rose just 0.1 per cent. Overall growth on a year-over-year basis slowed to 2.3 per cent, the weakest pace in two years. \n Economic Risks \n The report on the broadest measure of all goods and services comes as Fed is expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter point. The GDP report isn\u2019t likely to sway that outcome, though officials are likely to consider the weakness in trade and corporate investment as risks to the economic outlook. \n Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP,\u00a0final\u00a0sales\u00a0to domestic purchasers increased at a 3.5 per cent pace, the best in a year. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. Inventories were a drag on growth, subtracting 0.86 point from growth after a 0.53 point contribution in the prior period. \n The Fed's preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, firmed to a 1.8 per cent annual pace in the quarter, closer to policy makers' 2 per cent objective. \n The expansion, which this month became the longest on record, is cooling as the effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus fade and global growth slows, with the International Monetary Fund again cutting its estimate earlier this week. A stronger dollar and new tariffs are also making it less desirable to do business with the U.S. \n Other data have highlighted the cooler pace of growth, with manufacturing figures showing tepid conditions and bellwether Caterpillar Inc. reporting a lackluster second quarter. A U.S. measure of production has declined in consecutive\u00a0quarters, the common definition of recession, while a gauge of global\u00a0factory activity\u00a0contracted in May and June. \n Orders Gaining \n A more upbeat report Thursday showed business-equipment orders jumped in June by the most since early 2018, signaling company investment may be regaining momentum that would help support the economy in coming months. \n Consumer sentiment is near historical highs and robust spending is backstopping growth. Retail sales have advanced for four straight months, the longest streak since early 2018, indicating Americans are benefiting from a tight labor market and elevated wages. Coffee chain Starbucks Corp. on Thursday said U.S. comparable-store sales soared 7 per cent from a year earlier. \n Trump targets growth of about 3 per cent, though economists see the pace of growth remaining under 2 per cent through at least the end of next year. Revised GDP figures released Friday show 2.5 per cent growth on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis last year. That compares with a previous estimate of 3 per cent and an upwardly revised 2.8 per cent in 2017, the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency. \n Government spending got a boost from a 15.9 per cent surge in federal nondefense expenditures, which contributed the most in two decades to growth. That was boosted by delayed compensation for some federal employees after the government shutdown that ended in January. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "", "title": "China's growth slides to weakest pace in almost three decades", "description": "China\u2019s economy slowed to the weakest pace since quarterly data began in 1992 amid the ongoing trade standoff with the U.S., while monthly indicators provided signs that a stabilization is emerging.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-growth-slides-to-weakest-pace-in-almost-three-decades-1.1286989", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jul 14, 2019", "content": "China\u2019s economy slowed to the weakest pace since quarterly data began in 1992 amid the ongoing trade standoff with the U.S., while monthly indicators provided signs that a stabilization is emerging. \n Gross domestic product rose 6.2. per cent\u00a0in the April-June period from a year earlier, below the 6.4 per cent\u00a0expansion in the first quarter.

In the domestic market, whether the rebound in retail sales growth is sustainable is still uncertain.\u201d \n David Qu and Qian Wan, Bloomberg Economics \n Stronger Investment \n Fixed asset investment growth in the first half accelerated at private firms, whereas state companies eased back, a further sign that government efforts to funnel cash to the private sector may be bearing fruit. \n For the manufacturing sector, investment accelerated a notch to three per cent\u00a0in the first half, while infrastructure investment also picked up to 4.1 per cent. \n \n Better-than-expected retail sales data also lend credence to the idea that stability will emerge in the second half of the year. While the data are volatile, faster growth in sales of consumer goods, household appliances and furniture also point to the modest recovery ongoing in the vital property sector. \n The overall retail sales result was also driven by robust auto sales growth, though with heavy discounts attracting buyers in June economists remain cautious on whether that upturn can be sustained. \n A fiscal stimulus plan including about two trillion yuan (US$291 billion) of tax cuts is slowly feeding through into the economy. The government has stepped up efforts recently, easing the rules for using government debt in some infrastructure projects and pledging to renovate hundreds of thousands of old buildings. \n \u201cWe can take comfort in that the expansionary measures by the government are actually working,\"said Mary-Therese Barton, head of emerging market debt at Pictet Asset Management SA, speaking on Bloomberg TV. \"So we take a lot of heart in the retail sales data, in particular, and the strength of domestic consumption.\u201d \n Property Outlook \n Amid concerns about emerging price bubbles and risks in the financial sector, officials are likely to keep the recovery in the property market tightly controlled. Property development investment slowed for a second month in June, dragging down the growth of newly started property construction and inventory. \n Until now, China\u2019s leadership is tolerating the continued deceleration in the economy while the official unemployment rate remains low, and monetary policy has remained supportive without flooding the financial system with cash. Further tweaks to cement any nascent stabilization could be announced following a meeting of top leaders this month. \n \u201cChina\u2019s economy in the third quarter may face more downward pressure,\u201d said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cThere probably won\u2019t be any obvious policy adjustment in July, but more possibilities of change in the fourth quarter.\u201d \n --With assistance from\u00a0Tomoko Sato\u00a0and\u00a0Wendy Hu \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Oil rebound drives Canada's best two-month GDP gain since 2017", "description": "Canada recorded a second strong month of growth in April, driven by rebounding oil output that is returning the nation\u2019s economy to a more solid footing.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/oil-rebound-drives-canada-s-best-two-month-gdp-gain-since-2017-1.1280200", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jun 28, 2019", "content": "Canada recorded a second strong month of growth in April, driven by rebounding oil output that is returning the nation\u2019s economy to a more solid footing. \n Gross domestic product rose 0.3 per cent, after a 0.5 per cent gain in March, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa.

That\u2019s little changed from a 0.1 per cent quarterly (0.3 per cent annualized) reading in the final three months of 2018. Output was dragged lower by the biggest drop in exports in a year and a half. \n Yet outside of the trade sector the report was strong, with both consumption and business spending making big comebacks. Non-residential investment jumped 13.5 per cent on an annualized basis, the biggest gain since 2010, while spending by households rose at the fastest pace in almost two years. The quarter also ended with a bang, with gross domestic product jumping 0.5 per cent in March, the biggest gain in 10 months. \n \n The data support the Bank of Canada narrative on underlying strength in the economy despite the recent soft patch and that the slowdown will be temporary, with growth set to accelerate in coming months. The final reading for the first quarter was in line with the central bank\u2019s forecasts, though it came in below economist expectations for annualized growth of 0.7 per cent. \n \u201cFor Canadian growth, today was a case of out with the bad news, in with the good news,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors. \n The Canadian dollar pared loses after the report, but remained down 0.2 per cent to $1.3534 per U.S. dollar at 8:49 a.m. in Toronto trading. \n The Bank of Canada forecast growth will accelerate to an annualized 1.3 per cent in the second quarter, and pick up further in the second half of this year, before accelerating back to above 2 per cent growth by 2020. \n At the very least, the numbers suggest that heightened uncertainty -- everything from the impact of higher interest rates to potential trade wars and oil-sector woes -- has begun to fade. \n There are signs consumers are still spending even amid concerns over bloated debt loads --helped by easing rates on loans, strong job gains, stabilizing housing markets and improving financial markets. \n Household spending was up an annualized 3.5 per cent in the quarter, after growing at the slowest pace in almost four years at the end of last year. Business investment was even stronger, after falling for three straight quarters. As a result, domestic demand posted its first gain --3.4 per cent annualized -- for the first time in three quarters. \n \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at the various components, it\u2019s actually very good results,\u201d Benoit Durocher, senior economist at Desjardins Financial Group in Montreal, said by phone. \u201cYou have a rebound in domestic demand which is quite good.\u201d \n Canada\u2019s trade sector continues to be a major drag. The decline in the first quarter followed largely flat gains in the previous six months. But even here, trade data reported earlier this month suggested March was much better for exporters -- boding well for the second quarter. \n In fact, industry specific data released Friday suggest much of the weakness in the first quarter was confined to energy -- because of curtailed oil production in Alberta -- and construction. The mining and oil and gas sector was down 4.1 per cent in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2016. Construction recorded a 0.5 percent drop in the three-month period. Sixteen of 20 industries saw higher production. \n \n Other Details \n A build-up in inventories was another major contributor to growth, contributing 0.7 percentage points to the change in GDP. The Bank of Canada has cautioned the increase in stockpiles could dampen production in coming months Rising oil prices during the quarter helped generate a much larger gain in real gross national income, which was up 0.9 per cent in the three month period. Housing investment remained soft, dropping 1.6 per cent. One reason for the discrepancy between the gain in domestic demand and GDP is that many of the goods purchased were imported. Import volumes rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canadian economy shrinks with poor weather adding to oil woes", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy returned to its sluggish ways in February, with a drop in output that will reinforce expectations of a slow start to the year.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-economy-shrinks-with-poor-weather-adding-to-oil-woes-1.1251436", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Apr 30, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy returned to its sluggish ways in February, with a drop in output that will reinforce expectations of a slow start to the year. \n Gross domestic product fell 0.1 per cent, taking back some of the 0.3 per cent gain in January in part due to poor weather, Statistics Canada said Tuesday from Ottawa.

While the oil and gas sector continued to show weakness, the big decline was in mining and quarrying outside of energy. That component fell 4.4 per cent, driven by reduced output of most types of metals. \n A tough winter in much of the country also played a role in the contraction, adding to the economy\u2019s woes. This was evident in a 1.6 per cent drop in transportation and warehousing sector, the largest one-month decline for the sector since June 2011. On the flip side, February was a great month for utilities, which saw output jump 1.5 per cent because of the cold. \n \n Get More \n About half of the sectors tracked by Statistics Canada actually posted gains, with increases also recorded by builders, retailers and wholesalers. \n While conventional oil dropped, the situation in the oil sands seems to be stabilizing. That sector dropped just 0.1 per cent in February, after a 4.1 per cent drop a month earlier. \n Manufacturing contracted 0.4 per cent, after a 2.1 per cent gain in January that was the largest in nearly to 15 years. \n --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg. \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Simon Kennedy and Peter Coy", "title": "Why are economists so bad at forecasting recessions?", "description": "In 1966, four years before securing the Nobel Prize for economics, Paul Samuelson quipped that declines in U.S. stock prices had correctly predicted nine of the last five American recessions.

His profession would kill for such accuracy. \n With recession talk returning to haunt financial markets and the corridors of central banks, a review of the past suggests that those who are paid to call turning points in economic growth have a dismal record. Unlike the stock market, they\u2019re more likely to miss recessions than to predict ones that never occur. The lowlight, of course, was the widespread failure to forecast America\u2019s Great Recession, which began in December 2007\u2014nine months before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. \n In February, Andrew Brigden, chief economist at London-based Fathom Consulting, worked out that of 469 downturns since 1988, the International Monetary Fund had predicted only four by the spring of the preceding year. By the spring of the year in which the downturn occurred, the IMF was projecting 111 slumps, fewer than a quarter of those that actually happened. In a post on his firm\u2019s website, Brigden wrote that while IMF economists monitoring Equatorial Guinea, Papua New Guinea, and Nauru can walk tall for their recession calls, the rest pretty much flopped. \u201cSince 1988 the IMF has never forecast a developed economy recession with a lead of anything more than a few months,\u201d he says. \n IMF economists point out that they\u2019re not alone in missing downturns. A recent working paper by Zidong An, Joao Tovar Jalles, and Prakash Loungani discovered that of 153 recessions in 63 countries from 1992 to 2014, only five were predicted by a consensus of private-sector economists in April of the preceding year. And the economists tended to underestimate the magnitude of the slump until the year was almost over. \n The shortcomings of economists are in the spotlight again as the world economy traverses a soft patch. Growth in China continues to cool, while Europe is looking fragile. Italy is already in recession, and Germany and France risk stagnating. On March 22 the U.S. bond market flashed a warning sign when the yield on 10-year Treasury notes dipped below the yield on three-month Treasury bills. That reversal in the normal pattern of interest rates\u2014known as an inversion of the yield curve\u2014has generally been followed by a recession, although the length of time before a downturn varies widely. Meanwhile, in a recent survey of its members, the National Association for Business Economics found 42 per cent anticipate a U.S. recession beginning next year, along with 10 per cent predicting one this year and 25 per cent expecting one in 2021. \n What\u2019s behind economists\u2019 poor forecasting performance? The main reason is that it\u2019s simply a hard job. Information about the economy is incomplete and arrives with a lag. And turns in the economy tend to be abrupt. Some are caused by financial shocks, such as stock market panics, which are themselves unpredictable. \n Loungani, who works at the IMF, says a lack of incentives may also be partly to blame. Unlike portfolio managers, economists don\u2019t have money riding on their ability to accurately predict downturns, and misses are rarely career-ending. \n Groupthink may also pose an obstacle. Professional forecasters feel safer in a crowd rather than sticking their necks out with a recession call. Then there\u2019s a bias toward clinging to predictions even after contrary evidence emerges. The paper co-authored by Loungani shows that failing to forecast a recession is a much more common error than warning about one that doesn\u2019t occur. On the other hand, one way to make sure you never miss calling a recession is to constantly predict one\u2014but be vague about when it will arrive. Stretching out the time horizon is a common gambit. Predicting a contraction 18 to 24 months in the future is a reasonable wager: Since 1959 the chance that the U.S. economy will be in a recession in any given month has been about 13 per cent, according to Tom Stark, assistant director of the Real-Time Data Research Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. (Stark says that stat can\u2019t be used to calculate the probability of a recession in the next, say, two years.) \n Loungani nevertheless sees some room for optimism in economists\u2019 current behavior. In previous cycles, a lot of analysis was devoted to how times had changed and why the business cycle had been tamed, with more soft landings and fewer outright recessions. Stung by the failure of predicting the last recession, the profession has spent the past decade examining how expansions come to an end and discussing the policy tools that may be needed to stabilize an economy that\u2019s slowing. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists currently tell clients there\u2019s a 40 per cent chance of a downturn over the next year. \u201cThat\u2019s a better narrative than declaring we are in a new economy and the business cycle is dead,\u201d Loungani says. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Reade Pickert and Jeff Kearns", "title": "U.S. GDP growth of 3.2% tops forecasts on trade, inventory boost", "description": "U.S. economic growth accelerated by more than expected in the first quarter on a big boost from inventories and trade that offset a slowdown in consumer spending, bolstering the expansion ahead of a major milestone.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-gdp-growth-of-3-2-tops-forecasts-on-trade-inventory-boost-1.1249952", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Apr 26, 2019", "content": "U.S. economic growth accelerated by more than expected in the first quarter on a big boost from inventories and trade that offset a slowdown in consumer spending, bolstering the expansion ahead of a major milestone. \n Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized rate in the January-March period, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey calling for 2.3 per cent growth. That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months. \n But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers' 2 per cent objective. \n The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components -- inventories and trade -- that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed's forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation's longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump's goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach. \n The growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data. \n The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 per centage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can't be quantified. \n Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth. \n Fed Meeting \n Fed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data. \n At the same time, trade tension is fueling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Dutch government data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade. \n Friday\u2019s report showed net exports added 1.03 per centage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years. \n Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final\u00a0sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP. \n The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016. \n Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 per centage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties. \n Get More \n \n Government spending, driven by state and local infrastructure building, reversed a decline in the prior period, growing at an annualized 2.4 per cent pace that contributed 0.41 per centage point to the expansion, the most since 2017. \n A further complication to interpreting the importance of the report is a statistical quirk known as residual seasonality, which has contributed to persistently lower GDP readings in the first quarters of recent years. The government has attempted to remedy the phenomenon. \n \n The consumer spending slowdown primarily reflected slower purchases of goods, notably light trucks, Commerce said. The figures are less complete than a typical first GDP report: Delays from the government shutdown mean analysts didn't have some consumer-spending data or merchandise- trade figures to factor into their estimates. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "China's economic growth unexpectedly held up in first quarter", "description": "China\u2019s economy unexpectedly held up in the first three months as policy makers boosted stimulus measures to sustain growth.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-economic-growth-unexpectedly-held-up-in-first-quarter-1.1245621", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Apr 16, 2019", "content": "China\u2019s economy unexpectedly held up in the first three months as policy makers boosted stimulus measures to sustain growth. \n Gross domestic product rose 6.4 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, exceeding economist estimates and matching the previous three months.

Cannabis, both legal and illegal, is now included in the national economic accounts as StatCan released fourth-quarter gross domestic product figures. \n \u201cWith this release, cannabis is fully integrated in the national economic accounts, including estimates of legal and illegal economic activities related to cannabis production, distribution and consumption for non-medical and medical use,\u201d StatCan said in a statement. \u201cBefore this release, only economic activities related to legal use for medical purposes were recorded.\u201d \n StatCan added that cannabis accounted for 0.5 per cent of total household spending in the fourth quarter, while non-medical cannabis accounted for 11.2 per cent of Canadian household spending on alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. \n At market prices, cannabis accounted for $2.2 billion or 0.4 per cent of Canada\u2019s GDP in the fourth quarter. The illicit market was estimated to be worth $1.4 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the total fourth-quarter spend, while the legal market was $770 million. \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Economics\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1222249 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1222249', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1624827, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Canadian economy grows slower than expected in the fourth quarter \n Dawn Desjardins, deputy chief economist at RBC, joins BNN Bloomberg for her reaction to the latest Canadian GDP data. \n \n According to a report released by the  Bank of Nova Scotia last month , total cannabis demand in Canada is forecast to be 900 metric tonnes this year and should climb to 1,100 metric tonnes in 2020.\u00a0 \n Of that total demand, the black market should account for about 71 per cent of recreational cannabis sales this year, but will fall to 37 per cent in 2020, the bank said. \n StatCan said the average all-in market price paid for legal cannabis flower was $9.70 per gram in the fourth quarter of 2018.

It lost ground in response to the weak GDP numbers. \n The April gold contract was down US$16.90 at US$1,299.20 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 1.6 cents at US$2.93 a pound. \n In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 110.32 points at 26,026.32. The S&P 500 index was up 19.20 points at 2,803.69, while the Nasdaq composite was up 62.82 points at 7,595.35. \n U.S. market sentiment was helped by ongoing hope about a trade deal between the United States and China following a report that U.S. officials are preparing to sign a trade deal with China within a month. \n \"There continues to be hopefulness around the U.S.-China talks that they'll come up with some form of trade agreement in the near-term so I think investors have decided to focus on those positives,\" Guitard added. \n While North American markets have almost recovered from the deep losses late last year, Guitard said he wouldn't be surprised to see a pull-back because geopolitical issues such as trade and Brexit remain unresolved. \n \"I wouldn't be surprised to see it stall out in the short-term because there's been so much focus on the positives in the market, but these uncertain events are still out there.\" \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Erik Hertzberg and Luke Kawa", "title": "StatsCan erroneously publishes GDP figures early", "description": "Canada\u2019s central statistics agency accidentally released closely watched growth figures early on Friday, surprising traders and taking a dent out of the loonie.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/statscan-erroneously-publishes-gdp-figures-early-1.1222262", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 1, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s central statistics agency accidentally released closely watched growth figures early on Friday, surprising traders and taking a dent out of the loonie. \n Quarterly gross domestic product data was being circulated on Twitter as early as 8:04, with normal release due at 8:30 sharp. Compounding the surprise, the numbers showed Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly came pretty much to a halt in the final three months of 2018, growing at an annualized pace of 0.4 percent, well below the 1 per cent economists had forecast. \n \u201cObviously I care more about the figures and some of the details to it, but that just adds to the disappointment of the headlines,\u201d Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cYou would think that Stats Canada -- especially on a release like this -- would have their ducks in a row and with all the experience they have they wouldn\u2019t make an error like this.\u201d \n Peter Frayne, chief of communications for the government statistics agency, acknowledged the early release and said the matter is being investigated. \n The country\u2019s currency fell sharply once traders got wind of the numbers, reversing an earlier gain and depreciating as much as 0.5 per cent to $1.3241 against the greenback. \n Brian DePratto was among the first to notice the agency\u2019s error. \u201cI have an RSS Reader product that I use for work, and my usual process when I come in is to fire up the reader and get a sense of the newsflow,\u201d the senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank said by phone. \u201cAnd then I opened up the page and saw the Statscan feed had a bunch of new items on it, including those numbers.

The agency for years earned the ire of economists by releasing jobs and inflation data earlier than other data, a practice it ended in 2011. Around the same time, it admitted to allowing some distributors to get information almost a minute ahead of the official release, a practice that led to an investigation by KPMG LLP. \n It later emerged that Statistics Canada released economic reports a day before publication to at least 69 government workers and political aides, a practice that led to a review by lawmakers amid concern it was undermining investor confidence, given the risk the data could be leaked to financial markets. \n Porter says, though, he hasn\u2019t had big concerns lately about Statistics Canada and that the GDP data should have been handled more carefully. \u201cIt did move the markets -- so this was an important piece of news and one that shouldn\u2019t have been released early,\u201d he said. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Weaker-than-expected GDP shows Canadian growth stalling", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018, in a much deeper-than-expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/weaker-than-expected-gdp-shows-canadian-growth-stalling-1.1222243", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 1, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018, in a much deeper-than-expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt. \n The country's economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, for an annualized pace of 0.4 per cent, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. That's the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years, down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase. \n While a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices, it's a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector. Consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing fell by the most in a decade, business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015. \n The only thing that kept the nation's economy from contracting was a build-up in inventories as companies stockpiled goods. \n At the very least, the numbers suggest that heightened uncertainty -- everything from the impact of higher interest rates to potential trade wars and oil-sector woes -- has made a real impact on both consumer and business sentiment. The question now is what the weaker-than-expected data suggests about the economy's ability to rebound back to more normal growth levels. \n \n \n \n HAVE YOUR SAY  \n \n \n \n   \n Which of these will be most important to improving Canada\u2019s economic outlook?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1222287 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_2': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Business investment',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Consumers',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Exports',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_3': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Oil prices ',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n Most economists had been expecting the soft patch would come to an end by this spring and growth would accelerate closer to 2 percent for the rest of the year. No one, however, expected the economy would need to come back from such a low point. The Bank of Canada's latest forecast, from January, is for annualized growth of 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 0.8 percent in the first quarter, before the expansion accelerates back to above 2 percent growth by next year. \n Until recently, the economy had been doing relatively well even in the face of higher rates. It grew by a Group-of-Seven- best 3 percent in 2017, and expanded at a healthy clip in the first half of last year -- prompting the Bank of Canada to press ahead with higher borrowing costs. \n But even that strength had been overstated, with Statistics Canada revising down its estimates for first half growth to 2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. For all of 2018, the economy grew by 1.8 per cent -- below the Bank of Canada's estimate for 2 per cent. Monthly data released Friday show the economy ended the year contracting, with December gross domestic product down 0.1 percent. \n The data suggest rising interest rates may be having a bigger impact on consumers than expected. Consumption slowed to an annualized 0.7 per cent pace in the four quarter, the weakest growth since the start of 2015 as households increased their savings. \n Business investment also disappointed, with non-residential capital spending down an annualized 10.9 per cent -- the third straight quarterly decline and the second consecutive drop of more than 10 per cent. Residential investment also contracted for a second straight quarter, down an annualized 14.7 per cent, the biggest drop since 2009. \n The economy also wasn't able to get a contribution from exporters who have helped lift growth over the past year. Exports recorded an annualized 0.2 per cent drop in the fourth quarter. Imports also declined, down 1.1 per cent. \n The biggest contributor to growth came from inventories -- driven by machinery, food and wood producers. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "U.S. GDP grows above-forecast 2.6% as business spending picks up", "description": "The U.S. economy cooled by less than expected last quarter as business investment picked up, suggesting growth could be stronger for longer as the Federal Reserve takes a patient approach to interest rates.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-gdp-grows-above-forecast-2-6-as-business-spending-picks-up-1.1221590", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 28, 2019", "content": "The U.S. economy cooled by less than expected last quarter as business investment picked up, suggesting growth could be stronger for longer as the Federal Reserve takes a patient approach to interest rates. \n The 2.6 per cent annualized rate of gains in gross domestic product from October to December compared with the 2.2 per cent median\u00a0estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. It followed a 3.4 per cent advance in the prior three months, according to a Commerce Department report Thursday that was delayed a month by the government shutdown. \n Consumption,\u00a0which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 2.8 per cent, slightly below forecasts, while nonresidential business investment accelerated to a 6.2 per cent gain on equipment, software and research spending. Government spending slowed, trade was a minor drag and inventories gave GDP a small boost. \n The report shows how Republican-backed tax cuts may have continued to aid growth and help bring the full-year figure to 3.1 per cent, just above President Donald Trump\u2019s 3 per cent goal. While the expansion is poised to become the nation's longest on record at midyear amid a still-healthy consumer, supportive Fed and robust labor market, the pace could cool amid the trade war, slowing global growth and fading impact of fiscal stimulus. \n A separate report Thursday from the Labor Department showed filings for unemployment benefits rose by more than expected last week to 225,000, still near a five-decade low. The week included the Presidents Day holiday, and claims tend to be more volatile around such events. \n Potential Growth \n Growth, while slower than the prior two quarters, remains above both the average pace of the expansion and what the Fed sees as the economy's long-run potential of 1.9 per cent. Still, surveys and gauges such as Treasury yields indicate chances of a recession have increased in recent months while remaining unlikely for 2019. \n Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 2.6 per cent pace following 2.9 per cent. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. \n The increase in consumer spending followed the third quarter's 3.5 percent gain. It contributed 1.92 percentage points to growth. Drivers included health care, financial services and insurance, and other nondurable goods and services, while spending on food services and accommodations fell. \n The GDP data may reinforce analyst criticism of the government's recent report on December retail sales. That showed the biggest drop in nine years, even as other figures -- particularly reports from the country\u2019s largest retailers -- indicated consumers continued to open their wallets in the quarter. \n Thursday's report showed the third-quarter slowdown in business spending may have been temporary. Nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0.82 percentage point to growth following 0.35 point in the third quarter. \n Within that category, spending on structures fell 4.2 percent, the biggest drop in a year, a slowdown that may partly reflect falling oil prices. Business-equipment investment rose 6.7 percent and intellectual property spending jumped 13.1 percent. \n Residential Drag \n Housing remained a weak spot last quarter, posting the fourth consecutive drag on GDP growth, with a contraction of 3.5 percent. Home sales tumbled in late 2018 amid elevated mortgage rates and price increases that continued to outpace wages, though there are signs of demand picking up in early 2019 thanks to a drop in borrowing costs. \n Net exports subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth during the quarter following a 1.99-point reduction in the prior period. The drag reflected a 2.7 percent rise in imports that outpaced a 1.6 per cent increase in exports, with the tariff war buffeting both sets of flows. \n Inventories added 0.13 percentage point to the pace of expansion. \n Meanwhile, inflation remained muted, adding little urgency for the Fed to consider resuming interest-rate hikes. The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred price index rose at a 1.5 percent annualized pace last quarter, below the\u00a0central bank's 2 per cent goal. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 1.7 percent. \n Get More \n \n Government spending increased at a 0.4 per cent rate, reflecting a 6.9 per cent jump in defense spending -- the most in nine years -- and a 5.6 per cent contraction in non-defense spending, the biggest drop since 2013. \n The savings rate rose to 6.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent in the prior quarter, as inflation-adjusted disposable income rose 4.2 per cent, the most in three quarters. \n The partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22, had the effect of lowering fourth-quarter GDP growth by about 0.1 percentage point when accounting for the impact of reductions in services provided by the federal government, though the Commerce Department cautioned that the full effects of the shutdown on the economy can't be quantified. \n The first GDP estimate was originally scheduled for release Jan. 30. Thursday's report encompasses both advance and second estimates.

Consumption remained the main driver, easing to a 3 per cent increase, and government spending likely aided growth; the other principal categories of business investment, housing, trade and inventories all figure to provide either minor boosts or drags. \n While full-year 2018 growth probably came in near President Donald Trump\u2019s 3 per cent target, most analysts expect that pace to be short-lived, even as the expansion is on track to become the country\u2019s longest on record in July. The bigger question is whether growth will stabilize around its prior trend or is poised to weaken further -- potentially into a recession. \n \u201cConsumer spending looks to have been slowing in the fourth quarter, business investment has been slowing since early last year-- those patterns continued in the fourth quarter and we think trade has a lot to do with it,\u201d said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS Group AG. \u201cThe slowing in the fourth quarter is believable -- and the question is how long it lasts.\u201d \n A report Wednesday showed the U.S. merchandise-trade deficit widened by more than forecast in December to a record, suggesting GDP could come in lower than some analysts were expecting. \n Consumer spending, which accounts for most of the economy, is supported by a strong labor market and rising wages, and corporate investment has been buoyed by tax cuts. But that dynamic appeared to sour toward year-end. \n While the outlook remains favorable, the economy is feeling crosswinds from slowing global growth and uncertainty over trade, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in Senate testimony Tuesday. \n There were signs of weakness near the end of 2018. December retail sales unexpectedly dropped by the most in nine years despite elevated consumer sentiment. Economists were quick to cast doubt on that month\u2019s report, highlighting strong signals from other data providers and quarterly earnings figures from retailers. Yet any sign of consumer deterioration in the GDP data doesn\u2019t bode well for what comes next. \n \u201cIt looks like investment\u2019s kind of flat-lined, so we are even more dependent on the consumer,\u201d said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale SA. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the key. What retail sales do is not just give you a really bad end to the fourth quarter, but it suggests that the first quarter might start off on pretty soft footing as well.\u201d \n Government outlays -- which picked up in the prior two quarters after Congress approved higher spending, particularly on defense -- likely helped growth again.

The weakness, even if temporary, illustrates risks to an economy that needs business spending to take over from consumers who are burdened by record debts. \n The numbers leave the Bank of Canada \u201cdecidedly on hold for the next couple of quarters,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors. \n The central bank predicts the annualized pace of growth will slow to 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and again to 0.8 per cent in the first three months of this year. The economy is expected to rebound after that on strong job creation and business spending, with policy makers saying interest rates will still likely move higher over time. \n Output from the energy industry fell 0.6 per cent, Statistics Canada said. Lower production of petroleum and coal also drove a 0.5 per cent decline in manufacturing in November, the third drop in four months. Wholesaling fell by 1.1 per cent led by machinery and equipment, and construction fell for the sixth straight month to the lowest since the middle of 2017. \n Tumbling prices for Alberta oil late last year led the provincial government to impose production cuts that began in January.

Overall, the economy grew at a 2 per cent annualized pace, largely due an improved trade picture as imports fell. Domestic demand -- which excludes trade -- was the weakest in more than a year, recording a slight contraction. \n While the headline growth figure came in as economists had expected, the numbers suggest the growing trade tensions that occurred over the summer -- and eventually culminated in a new deal with the U.S. and Mexico -- put at least a temporary chill on spending. \n Other factors impacting growth may have been a weakening outlook for the country's oil industry and the impact of rising interest rates on consumers. \n Consumption slowed to an annualized 1.2 per cent pace in the third quarter, the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2016. That's even as households scaled back on savings. \n Sluggish business investment may be the biggest surprise in the data, with non-residential capital spending down an annualized 7.1 per cent -- the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2016. Residential investment contracted for a third straight quarter, down an annualized 5.9 per cent. \n For the three months between July and September, it all added up to sluggish domestic demand, down an annualized 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. \n September ended up being the worst month of the quarter, with data released Friday showing a 0.1 per cent drop. That was the first monthly decline since January. Economists predicted an increase of 0.1 per cent. \n The report could raise concerns about the health of the economy, which has been doing relatively well up until now even in the face of higher interest rates. The economy grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3.1 per cent in 2017, and had expanded at a healthy 2.3 per cent clip in the first half of this year in part due to stronger business investment.

The decline in imports coincided with increased domestic production of gasoline after the completion of maintenance work at Canadian refineries. \n Because exports eked out a small 0.9 annualized increase in the third quarter, the contribution of trade on growth was large -- adding about 3 percentage points. \n Another major drag on growth was a slowdown in inventory accumulation.

It came on the heels of an emerging crisis in the oil sector, which is struggling with plunging prices and transportation bottlenecks. \n Combined, the energy and automotive industries generate almost one quarter of Canadian export receipts. So their troubles are a reminder there are no guarantees the economy will be able to pull off a smooth transition to a business-led expansion as consumers begin to tap out. Third-quarter gross domestic product data is due out Friday. \n \u201cThe news that we\u2019ve been seeing both in terms of the energy and the auto sectors gives a little bit more caution to the degree of that pickup in exports and investment on a go-forward basis,\u201d Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview. \n \n Until now, things have been going well for Canada\u2019s economy. It grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3.1 per cent in 2017, and is continuing to expand at a healthy clip of 2 per cent this year even in the face of higher interest rates. A recent recovery in business investment, an improving trade picture and still growing consumer spending are helping to fuel the growth. \n Statistics Canada\u2019s latest GDP estimates are expected to show the economy grew by about 2 per cent in the third quarter, in line with the 2.2 per cent pace posted in the first half of 2018. \n But to keep growth at or near these levels going forward will require businesses to continue stepping up in terms of investment and exports. Most economists believe Canada\u2019s highly-indebted households are about to slip into a long-term slump as borrowing costs rise, with consumer spending projected to slow down to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession. \n Yet the recent developments in the auto and oil sectors raise the prospect that transition may need to take place without two critical industries -- a major handicap. \n While the shutdown of GM\u2019s Oshawa plant will only affect about 3,000 hourly and salaried workers -- economists at Bank of Montreal estimate GDP could be hit by as much as 0.2 per cent over a full year -- the concern is it could snowball to other companies and spill over into the auto parts sector. \n \u2018More to Come\u2019 \n \u201cIf there is a \u2018canary\u2019 out there it has been slowly dying for quite some time,\u201d Dennis DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc., said by email. \u201cI am not saying that Canada will become Australia and eventually lose all its vehicle assembly operations, but there is more to come.\u201d \n The oil industry\u2019s problems could be even more significant. Economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank estimate a hit of 0.5 percentage points to growth if the current pricing environment persists, though they do expect a rebound. \n Gluskin Sheff\u2019s chief economist and strategist David Rosenberg estimates a larger-than-consensus growth hit of 0.4 per cent from the General Motors shutdown, with a similar 0.5 per cent hit from oil. That would take Canadian growth down closer to 1 per cent, far from the current pace, he said in a Nov. 27 research note that included ten reasons \u201cto hate\u201d the Canadian dollar. \n \u201cAs for Canada, the tale of woes continues,\u201d he said. \n --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Greg Quinn. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Shobhana Chandra", "title": "U.S. economy grew at unrevised 3.5% pace in third quarter", "description": "The U.S. economy remained on a solid footing in the third quarter, matching previously reported results, as stronger business investment and a bigger boost from inventories cushioned the worst trade drag since 1984.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-economy-grew-at-unrevised-3-5-pace-in-third-quarter-1.1174847", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 28, 2018", "content": "The U.S. economy remained on a solid footing in the third quarter, matching previously reported results, as stronger business investment and a bigger boost from inventories cushioned the worst trade drag since 1984. \n Gross domestic product grew at an unrevised 3.5 per cent annualized rate, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.

In two volatile categories, inventories provided the biggest contribution since early 2015, while the drag from trade was the largest in 33 years. Government spending rose by the most since 2016. \n The data indicate a robust job market and lower taxes continued to propel demand among consumers and companies, giving President Donald Trump an opportunity to showcase his policies heading into the midterm congressional elections. At the same time, tariff-related bottlenecks and the trade war with China are headwinds for the nation's second-longest economic expansion on record. \n Investors have become less sanguine on the outlook amid the latest run of U.S. company earnings reports, though stocks regained some ground on Thursday. Shares of Caterpillar Inc., an economic bellwether, tumbled this week after the maker of mining and construction equipment said manufacturing costs were higher due to rising material and freight costs. \n More broadly, the International Monetary Fund earlier this month cut its global growth forecast for the first time in two years, blaming escalating trade tensions and stresses in emerging markets. World GDP would fall further should Trump follow through on all his trade threats, including global duties on cars, the IMF said. \n Final Demand \n Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 3.1 per cent pace, slowing from 4 per cent. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. Excluding government spending, the measure of private demand also rose 3.1 per cent. \n Consumer spending compared with projections for a 3.3 per cent advance, and followed the second quarter's 3.8 percent gain. It contributed 2.69 percentage points to growth. Purchases rose across most major categories including motor vehicles, recreational goods, food and clothing, in part reflecting the support from steady hiring and the lowest unemployment rate in about five decades. \n Hurricane Florence, which made landfall in North Carolina on Sept. 14, \u201cdisrupted consumption and business activities, including utilities,\u201d while emergency and other services \u201clikely increased in response to the disaster,\u201d the Commerce Department said. The government said it couldn't estimate the overall impact of the storm on third-quarter GDP. \n Talking Point \n Even so, the GDP figures give Trump a timely talking point during campaign rallies, and yet another chance to claim the robust expansion for his own following the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era. GDP rose 3 per cent from a year earlier, the most on that basis since 2015 and matching the administration's goal. \n Yet growth is expected to moderate in 2019 as the effects of the tax cuts wane, while tariffs and a strong dollar weigh on the economy. Borrowing costs also may keep rising, as investors project the Federal Reserve will raise the benchmark interest rate for a fourth time this year in December. \n Even with growth and employment above what most analysts and central bankers see as the economy's sustainable capacity, inflation remains contained. Price data in the GDP report showed inflation at a 1.6 per cent annualized pace last quarter, below the\u00a0Fed\u2019s 2 per cent goal. Excluding food and energy, the central bank's preferred price index also rose at a 1.6 per cent rate. \n Business Investment \n Nonresidential fixed investment -- which includes spending on equipment, structures and intellectual property -- contributed just 0.12 percentage point to growth, following 1.15 point in the second quarter. \n Within that category, spending on structures shrank 7.9 per cent, the biggest drop in almost three years, following a 14.5 per cent surge in the prior period that partly reflected investment in oil production. Equipment investment cooled to a 0.4 per cent advance, the slowest since 2016, and the rise in intellectual- property spending eased to a three-quarter low of 7.9 per cent. \n Housing remained a weak spot, posing the third consecutive drag on GDP growth, with a contraction of 4 per cent. Recent reports indicate the industry is slowing amid higher prices and rising mortgage rates, as well as a lack of affordable listings. \n Inventories, Trade \n GDP growth last quarter benefited from a rebuilding of inventories, which dragged down expansion in the prior period amid tariff-related supply-chain disruptions and steady demand. The third-quarter increase was broad-based and led by wholesale trade, particularly farm products, and manufacturing, according to the Commerce Department. \n The trade component reflected a widening deficit, with a 3.5 per cent decline in exports and a 9.1 per cent increase in imports. That was driven by an unwinding of the hefty boost from net exports in the second quarter when U.S. exporters of soybeans and other products accelerated shipments to beat retaliatory tariffs from abroad. \n Solid domestic demand and some front-loading of imports ahead of a January rise in levies on Chinese goods may further widen the trade gap. \n Other Details \n \n Government spending increased at 3.3 per cent rate, contributing 0.56 percentage point to growth; federal outlays rose 3.3 per cent amid a 4.6 per cent gain in defense spending, while state and local outlays increased at a 3.2 per cent rate, the most since 2016 \n The savings rate fell to 6.4 per cent from 6.8 per cent \n The GDP estimate is the first of three for the quarter, with the other releases scheduled for November and December when more information becomes available \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "", "title": "China economic growth slows more than expected in third quarter", "description": "China\u2019s economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, as weak industrial output data and what the government called the \"severe international situation\" challenged efforts to stabilize the economy and reach its growth targets.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-economic-growth-slows-more-than-expected-in-third-quarter-1.1154906", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 18, 2018", "content": "China\u2019s economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, as weak industrial output data and what the government called the \"severe international situation\" challenged efforts to stabilize the economy and reach its growth targets. \n Gross domestic product increased 6.5 per cent in the three months through September from a year earlier, compared to 6.6 per cent in a Bloomberg survey and down from the 6.7 per cent pace in the previous quarter. That\u2019s the slowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. \n The economy has faced increasing headwinds this year, with worsening trade tensions and a slumping stock market hurting confidence in the outlook. Those problems have prompted officials to step up stimulus and pledges of further support, but the impact of those measures has yet to kick in and more may be needed. \n National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Mao Shengyong said at a briefing Friday that while the international situation was bringing \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on China\u2019s economy, growth is still stable and the nation is on track to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 per cent. \r\nDetails of the release Industrial output rose 5.8 per cent last month from a year earlier, versus the forecast of 6 per cent, the statistics office said Retail sales increased 9.2 per cent in September, compared with the forecast 9 per cent Fixed-asset investment climbed 5.4 per cent in the first nine months, versus a forecast of 5.3 per cent The urban monthly surveyed\u00a0unemployment rate stood at 4.9 per cent at end-September\r\n\r\n \"China\u2019s economy is losing steam,\" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \"While it\u2019s easy to blame the trade tussle with the U.S. for this, the deceleration so far is mostly domestic driven, with infrastructure spending contracting and car sales coming off the boil.\" \n \n Shortly before the data release, China\u2019s top financial officials moved to shore up investor confidence in the country\u2019s tumbling stock market, a rare coordinated show of verbal support that failed to immediately put a floor under the deepest equity sell-off since 2015. \n Vice Premier Liu He, a key economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, and the heads of the central bank, banking and insurance regulator and securities regulator all issued statements on Friday voicing their support for the market and promising measures to help ease financial pressures on companies, especially those with a high proportion of pledged shares. The officials stopped short of promising direct intervention. \n \"All sorts of risks and problems accumulated in the past are now emerging, which is an inevitable process and should be viewed rationally,\" Liu said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. While China\u2019s economy faces difficulties at the moment, it still has \"very bright outlook\" over the longer term, he said. \n Liu said the trade war has impacted China more psychologically, the government is in touch with the U.S. and \"pays high attention\" to the healthy and steady development of the stock market. \n Liu also denied the speculation that the private economy is being sidelined while state firms advance. He said there\u2019s \"no such thing,\" adding that the two sectors are interdependent and should cooperate, and it\u2019s \"completely wrong\" for some banks to think it\u2019s safer to lend to state companies than private ones. \n The nation\u2019s\u00a0benchmark\u00a0stock index the Shanghai Composite Index extended gain to 2.4 per cent as of 2:07 pm in Shanghai. \r\nWhat our economists\u00a0 say \"The slowdown was driven by weakness in the manufacturing sector,\" where\u00a0 growth\u00a0slowed to 5.3 percent from 6 percent in the second quarter.\u00a0\"We see more weakness heading into year-end, as the trade war impact becomes more visible and supportive policies take time to kick in.\"-- Chang Shu\u00a0and Justin Jimenez, Bloomberg Economics\r\n\r\n While growth in total retail sales accelerated in September on a year-over-year basis, that of sales at large retailers slowed to 5.7 per cent, from 6 per cent in August. Auto sales, which make up the largest component of total sales of large retailers, dropped 7.1 per cent from a year earlier in September, the worst decline in data from 2002. \n The figure for larger companies is based on a complete survey while data on sales at smaller outlets is based on a sample, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. \n NBS publishes an official year-over-year growth rate for retail sales as well as a yuan amount. A growth rate calculated based on the yuan amount shows sales were up just 3.7 per cent on a year-over-year basis. The divergence, which NBS says is due to revisions based on the latest census, has led analysts to question the veracity of the data. \n Slowing Infrastructure Investment \n Manufacturing investment growth in the nine months through September accelerated to 8.7 per cent over the same period last year, the fastest pace since August 2015. Growth of infrastructure investment fell to 3.3 per cent. It\u2019s decelerated in every month since November 2017.

Forecasters also expect data on retail sales and fixed-asset investment to show growth held steady in September, while growth of industrial production probably ticked a notch lower. \n The reports will offer details on the state of China\u2019s economy through the end of September, when the U.S. escalated the ongoing trade war. On Sept. 24, the two countries imposed a new round of duties on each other\u2019s exports, with the U.S. pledging to increase them further on January 1, unless an agreement is reached before then. Chinese manufacturers say the current tariff levels are manageable, but that the increases next year would be a game-changer. \n To better gauge China\u2019s economy, here\u2019s what to watch in the reports: \n Stronger Trade Boost to GDP \n Paradoxically, the trade war may be boosting shipments now. The unexpected acceleration of export growth in September should boost the contribution net exports make to the expansion in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected performance was probably thanks to front-loading of shipments to the U.S. ahead of implementation of the new tariffs, according to Betty Wang, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Hong Kong. \n She flagged a jump in electrical machinery sales in particular -- China\u2019s biggest export to the U.S. -- as partly responsible. \n But industrial production data show growth in the manufacture of such products has been dropping fast since the middle of last year. The growth rate in August from a year earlier declined to 3.3 percent, the lowest in 12 years of data. \n If Friday\u2019s data show growth in this area continuing to decelerate, it may confirm the temporary nature of the export boom. \n Unemployment Rates \n In the short term, job losses from the effects of the trade war will be a key concern. China will publish two versions of its unemployment rate Friday -- a quarterly measure based on filings for unemployment benefits, which has fallen in recent quarters, and a monthly indicator based on household surveys, which is more akin to measures published in the U.S. and Europe. That one fell in the second quarter before rising again. \n Investment Handoff \n Despite the trade war, growth in fixed-asset investment among manufacturers has actually accelerated since the start of the year. Investment in property development has also grown in 2018 at the fastest pace in three years. Infrastructure investment growth, on the other hand, has decelerated from 20 percent last year to just above 4 percent. \n The question is whether sentiment is strong enough to continue propelling manufacturing investment at that level, and whether recent measures taken by the Chinese government to insulate the economy from trade-war fallout will start to show up in the infrastructure spending data. \n Infrastructure investment should be a bit better in September \"on the back of accelerated local government special bond issuance,\" Morgan Stanley economists Jenny Zheng, Robin Xing and Cai Zhipeng wrote in an Oct. 10 report. \"However, investment growth in the manufacturing sector has likely moderated due to weaker business sentiment in the face of ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, and property FAI could have softened amid weaker property and land sales.\" \n Auto Sales \n Retail sales growth has slowed since the beginning of the year, in part thanks to the continued decline in vehicle purchases. Those were about a third of the value of all consumer goods sold in August, when they dropped 3.2 per cent from a year earlier. \n Total vehicles sold fell 11.6 per cent in September from a year earlier, according to a different data set from the China Automotive Information Network, which doesn\u2019t bode well for the official statistics to be published Friday. \n Income Versus Consumption \n In the longer term, China\u2019s task is to transition from an economy based on investment and external demand to one rooted in domestic consumption, and the key to achieving that is boosting labor\u2019s share of income over time. \n Not only will data on household income growth to be published Friday give an update on how that\u2019s going, but a comparison to household consumption growth will also provide an indirect read on consumer confidence. \n From the end of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018, growth of disposable income outpaced that of consumption, implying a build-up in household savings. But in the second quarter of this year, the relationship flipped. Whether that continues will be a point of interest. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canadian economy grows 0.2% in July; boosted by manufacturing", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy got a boost from a strong pick up in manufacturing, recording faster-than-expected growth in July.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-economy-grows-0-2-in-july-boosted-by-manufacturing-1.1144626", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 28, 2018", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy got a boost from a strong pick up in manufacturing, recording faster-than-expected growth in July. \n Gross domestic product expanded by 0.2 per cent, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa, versus economist projections of a 0.1 per cent gain.

The Canadian dollar dropped sharply when the first headlines crossed late yesterday but has since almost fully rebounded. If true, the Post\u2019s report would seem to underscore the Americans' NAFTA tactic is to divide and conquer -- almost treating it as two separate bilateral paths to a trilateral deal. It also brings us back to the question of how much Canada is willing to give up in order to strike an agreement.

It followed first-quarter growth of 2.2 per cent that was revised from 2 per cent, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Consumer spending grew 4 per cent, more than estimated, while nonresidential business investment climbed at a 7.3 per cent clip. \n Trump seized the chance to declare his policies, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, a success, calling the data \u201camazing\u201d and \u201cvery sustainable.\u201d The likelihood is nevertheless that the pace of expansion will slow as the effects of tax cuts fades, companies pull back in the face of foreign tariffs and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further. \n Illustrating the volatility of some elements of GDP, net exports contributed 1.06 percentage point to the pace of growth, the most since 2013, partly on a surge in soybean shipments ahead of retaliatory tariffs. Inventories subtracted 1 point, the most since 2014, Commerce said, citing soybean stocks as well as those of drugs and sundries and petroleum and related products. \n Fed policy makers are expected to continue their gradual pace of interest-rate hikes aimed at keeping the economy from overheating, without moving so fast that they could choke off growth. The dollar and yields on 10-year Treasuries declined after the report, which also showed inflation excluding food and energy was lower than estimated. \n \u201cThe economy is doing quite well,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to repeat this performance on a sustained basis,\u201d as the boost to demand from tax cuts may fade, the dollar\u2019s strength could curb exports and tariffs present a risk, he said. \n The latest data won\u2019t change the pace of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate hikes, Feroli said. \n \u2018Great Numbers\u2019 \n Trump, speaking Friday at the White House, celebrated the report and said the economy is on track to reach an annual growth rate of more than 3 percent. \u201cAs the trade deals come in one by one, we\u2019re going to go a lot higher than these numbers, and these are great numbers,\u201d the president said. \n Economists\u2019 forecasts for second-quarter GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the nation, ranged from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. The GDP estimate is the first of three for the quarter, with the other releases scheduled for August and September when more information becomes available. \n With the Friday data, the Commerce Department also released comprehensive GDP revisions going back decades. They showed a higher household-saving rate than previously reported, as well as faster growth in the first quarter of recent years, though the overall narrative of the economy\u2019s performance over the last decade wasn\u2019t much different. \n The revisions also showed the economy surpassed US$20 trillion in nominal dollars in the first quarter. \n Even with the relatively strong pace of growth last quarter, most economists expect expansion to settle back to near its long-run rate, and some have flagged the risk of a recession in two years. While polls and historical trends suggest Democrats are primed for significant gains in November\u2019s midterm elections, voters give Trump high marks for the economy. \n GDP Goal \n Compared with a year earlier, second-quarter GDP rose 2.8 per cent, just shy of the 3 per cent mark, which was last reached in 2015. The Trump administration\u2019s official goal is for sustained GDP growth of 3 per cent, which would well exceed the average 2.2 per cent pace during this expansion and the Fed\u2019s longer-run expectation of 1.8 per cent. \n One measure that economists look at for a better sense of underlying demand showed strength. Final sales to private domestic purchasers -- which exclude trade, inventories and government outlays -- grew at a 4.3 per cent pace, the second- fastest since 2014. \n What Our Economists Say \r\nTo be sure, there is evidence that tax reforms and cuts are helping to stimulate activity, but the performance of consumer spending in the second quarter is unlikely to carry through in full force into the second half of the year. As a result, the overall pace of growth will moderate.\u00a0Bloomberg Economics is maintaining its forecast for 2.8 per cent growth in the second half. Consumers are benefiting from tax cuts and a tighter labor market, but household income creation has not yet accelerated to a pace that can support 4 per cent growth on a sustained basis.  -- Carl Riccadonna\u00a0and\u00a0 Tim Mahedy, Bloomberg Economics\u00a0 \n The pace of expansion in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy, exceeded projections for 3 per cent and contributed 2.69 percentage points to growth. Purchases of new autos were a major factor, along with spending on health care, housing and utilities and food services and accommodations. That followed a downwardly revised 0.5 per cent pace of consumption growth in the prior three months. \n In addition to lower taxes, consumers\u2019 purchasing power is benefiting from steady hiring, an unemployment rate that\u2019s near the lowest since 1969, improving finances, relatively low borrowing costs and contained inflation. \n Business Investment \n The growth in nonresidential business investment contributed almost 1 percentage point to growth though the 7.3 per cent pace was slower than the first quarter\u2019s 11.5 per cent. Spending on structures advanced 13.3 percent following a 13.9 per cent gain in the prior period, while equipment investment cooled to 3.9 per cent and intellectual property spending slowed to 8.2 per cent. \n Housing remained a weak spot in the economy amid signs that the sector is poised for its broadest slowdown in years. Residential investment contracted at a 1.1 per cent rate, the fourth decline in five quarters. The drag on overall growth, though, was negligible. \n The contribution from net exports reflected a 9.3 per cent gain in shipments abroad and a 0.5 per cent increase in imports. In addition to soybeans, exports were boosted by petroleum and related products. \u201cProducers may have front-loaded some goods for exports ahead of the tariffs,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s Feroli said. \n Government spending increased at a 2.1 per cent rate, adding 0.37 percentage point to growth. Federal outlays rose 3.5 per cent, the second-fastest rate since 2014, boosted by defense spending. State and local outlays advanced 1.4 per cent. \n Spending Power \n The data showed consumers\u2019 wallets grew at a slower pace. After- tax incomes adjusted for inflation increased at a 2.6 per cent annual pace, after 4.4 per cent in the prior quarter. The saving rate fell to 6.8 per cent from 7.2 per cent, which was revised from 3.3 per cent as part of the comprehensive update. \n First-quarter gross domestic income, adjusted for inflation, was revised to a 3.9 per cent gain from a previously reported 3.6 per cent. \n Price data in the report indicated that inflation was in line with the Fed\u2019s goal. Excluding food and energy, the central bank\u2019s preferred price index rose at a 2 per cent annualized rate last quarter, following 2.2 per cent in the first three months of the year. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: Ontario reportedly switching to private pot model; Air Canada results", "description": "Noah Zivitz", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-ontario-reportedly-switching-to-private-pot-model-air-canada-results-1.1115128", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jul 27, 2018", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Doug Ford is reportedly getting set to rip up his predecessor\u2019s plan for recreational cannabis retail in Ontario.

But passengers are going to feel the burn from higher fuel costs, which pushed Air Canada's total operating expenses to $4.1 billion in the second quarter.

Statistics Canada reconciled the discrepancy by saying much of the production ended up as inventory, which suggests a correction may be in store for the sector as those inventories get wound down. Both durable and non-durable manufacturing posted gains. \n The real estate sector -- which has struggled amid a slumping housing market -- continues to show signs of stabilization. Real estate agent and broker activity was up 0.5 per cent during the month, the biggest gain since tighter mortgage regulations were implemented at the start of the year. \n Unseasonably cold weather in April also had an impact on the numbers, in both directions. It helped activity at utilities, which saw a 1.6 percent gain during the month, but hurt retail activity, which was down 1.3 per cent. \n Other GDP Highlights \n Transportation and warehousing services were down, led by a 2.3 per cent drop in rail transportation, in part due to fewer car loadings of manufactured products Oil and gas extraction also showed surprising strength, up 0.6 per cent, driven by higher output of conventional crude. Oil sands output was down 0.1 per cent due to maintenance of some facilities Mining excluding oil and gas dropped 9.1 per cent, with Statistics Canada citing a labor disruption in iron ore mining Construction was down 0.5 per cent in April, the largest decline in a year. \n With files from BNN Bloomberg\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "U.S. first-quarter GDP growth revised down to 2% on services", "description": "The U.S. economy expanded in the first quarter at a slower pace than previously estimated, reflecting downward revisions to spending on services and to inventory investment, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-first-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-down-to-2-on-services-1.1100306", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jun 28, 2018", "content": "The U.S. economy expanded in the first quarter at a slower pace than previously estimated, reflecting downward revisions to spending on services and to inventory investment, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. \n KEY TAKEAWAYS \n The smaller gain in first-quarter services spending primarily reflected fewer outlays by non-profits for health care.

While often associated with seasonal jobs, attractions, and tours, it is a vitally important industry coast to coast. \n According to the World Trade & Tourism Council, tourism in Canada contributed $41.8 billion to the country\u2019s GDP in 2017, with that number expected to rise to $56.1 billion by 2028. The industry supports 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs in Canada, making up 8.6 per cent of the total employment numbers in the country. \n An often-overlooked aspect of the industry is the important role that business events (meetings, conventions, conferences, and congresses) have on the Canadian economy. These events provide a significant economic and long-term legacy on the host city or community. According to Loren Christie, director of sales, Canada & International Congress, at Tourism Toronto, last year Toronto hosted 951 meetings and events that brought 400,000 delegates that generated spending of $634 million into the local economy. \n Ambassador programs are becoming more common across the country, where convention bureaus and local communities partner with top thinkers, innovators, and researchers to bring international meetings to cities to build on their global reputation, promote innovation, and leave a legacy of social and economic benefits. In an aim to attract these important meetings, destinations across the country are shifting their emphasis to intellectual assets to make it a more attractive destination to a meeting planner in a particular sector. \n Here are some examples summarized by Christie. \n Toronto \u2013 Leaders Circle \n \"Since 2015, Toronto\u2019s Leaders Circle has fostered and supported local ambassadors in the process of bringing international events to the city. It\u2019s important to note that without a local ambassador, 70 per cent of international conventions would not consider an overseas destination. Leaders Circle ambassadors play an instrumental role in attracting meetings which greatly elevate the vitality of business events in Toronto and provide significant intellectual and community benefits to the city and province.\" \n Calgary \u2013 Calgary Champion Program \n \"In 2013, the Calgary Champion program was launched with an aim to engage leaders in priority sectors to attract international conferences to the city. These connections deliver heightened intellectual capital in the community, local and national programming and global networking business opportunities. As well, this helps international organizations reach a targeted local network of potential speakers, exhibitors, sponsors and research groups.\" \n Vancouver -\u00a0Be A Host Program \n \"Vancouver\u2019s Be a Host Program, is an alliance of local industry leaders dedicated to advancing research, knowledge and innovation in their respective fields. In partnership with the Vancouver Convention Centre and the hotel community, the program launched in 1996 and is a forerunner of similar programs now taking off in meeting destinations worldwide.

The currency has weakened in 10 of the last 11 sessions. \n The Canadian dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks on concerns that negotiators will fail to reach an agreement to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Donald Trump added to trade worries Thursday, pledging to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminum. Canada is the largest exporter of steel to the U.S. \n Meanwhile, data out on Friday showed Canada\u2019s economy decelerated more than expected in the second half of last year, amid signs indebted households have begun to curb spending. The economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada reported, versus economist expectations for 2 per cent growth. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth was also revised down. \n Even as the loonie broke above its 200-day moving average this week, reinforcing the notion there\u2019s more weakness to come, some market watchers believe the currency has sold off too much. \n \u201cA lot of bad news is priced in to the Canadian dollar at these levels,\u201d said Shaun Osborne, Toronto-based chief foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia. While the White House imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports \u201cmight be seen as a negative for the Canadian dollar initially, we think erecting trade barriers would work against the U.S. dollar in the longer run.\u201d \n The Bank of Canada will make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday after increasing the key rate three times since mid-2017 to 1.25 per cent. All 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the rate to stay unchanged, with the market pricing in two to three more hikes later this year, according to overnight index swaps data. The odds of a rate hike for April have declined to 37 per cent, from more than 60 per cent last month. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canadian GDP growth falls short of expectations in Q4", "description": "Canada\u2019s economy decelerated more than expected in the second half of last year, amid signs indebted households have begun slowing down spending.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-gdp-growth-falls-short-of-expectations-in-q4-1.1015676", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 2, 2018", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy decelerated more than expected in the second half of last year, amid signs indebted households have begun slowing down spending. \n The economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada reported Friday, versus economist expectations for 2 per cent growth. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth was also revised down to 1.5 per cent from an initial estimate of 1.7 per cent. \n The data not only show the slowdown is well underway, which was expected, but an economy that isn\u2019t even growing above its so- called potential growth level. \n That\u2019s a surprise since most economists were expecting Canadian growth would continue to run slightly above its noninflationary speed limit for at least another year, leading to price pressures that would prompt the Bank of Canada to keep hiking interest rates. \n \"The main message though is that the exciting growth from the middle of 2016 up until the middle of 2017 is now truly in the past, and the economy is back to the drudgery of slogging out something closer to potential of around 2 per cent.

I think that the Bank of Canada is going to be pretty cautious in how it moves forward and how quickly it raises rates,\u201d he told BNN in an interview Friday. \u00a0 \n What may be worse is that fourth-quarter GDP figures were exaggerated by temporary factors in housing. Spending on residential structures surged in the last three months of 2017 to an annualized 13.4 per cent, the strongest quarterly increase since 2012. The gain was led by stronger-than-expected new home construction, and as buyers rushed to get ahead of tighter mortgage qualification rules that came into effect Jan. 1. \n The increase in residential spending was responsible for 1 percentage point of the 1.7 per cent growth rate, Statistics Canada said. Residential investment had been a drag on growth the previous two quarters. \n Statistics Canada did revise up growth estimates for the first half of the year to 4.2 per cent, from an initially reported 4 per cent. \n The second half slowdown was driven in large part by household spending, with consumption growth in the fourth quarter at the slowest pace since 2016. \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Economics\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1015750 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1015750', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1338690, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bank of Canada to remain cautious on rates, lower loonie to benefit Canada for now: Economist \n BNN speaks with Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy about the latest Canadian GDP numbers \u2014 the first significant piece of economic data since the release of Ottawa's latest budget. \n \n Other highlights of the GDP report: \n -Statistics Canada reported GDP for the month of December rose 0.1 per cent, in line with analyst expectations \n -Monthly GDP was also driven higher by the housing market gains, which helped offset a drop in construction and manufacturing \n -GDP expanded by 3.0 per cent last year, the fastest pace since 2011 \n -Exports recovered in the fourth quarter, with an annualized 3 per cent gain, after plunging in the third quarter.
