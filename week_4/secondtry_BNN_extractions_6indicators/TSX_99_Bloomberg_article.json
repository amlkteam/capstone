The Fed also issued a stark warning Friday, just as the market closed, that stock and other asset prices could suffer \u201csignificant declines\u201d should the coronavirus pandemic deepen. \n \u201cWe\u2019ve effectively moved from the \u2018shock and awe\u2019 phase associated with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to the \u2018aw, shucks\u2019 phase when investors recalibrate to the potential difficulties associated with containing and recovering from the global pandemic,\u201d said Kurt Reiman, who sets strategy for the Canadian arm of BlackRock Inc. \n \n Case in point: Asian economies that have seen some of the most success quelling the coronavirus are now facing resurgences. It\u2019s a painful reminder that as countries open up again and people resume normal life, flare-ups are likely. Closer to home, Quebec had to push back the time frame to restart the economy in Montreal as the city and its suburbs became Canada\u2019s biggest COVID-19 hotspot. In contrast, Ontario announced it would begin to reopen most stores, except for those in shopping malls. \n The S&P/TSX Composite gained Friday, but was down 2.2 per cent\u00a0for the week, trimming its gains to 30 per cent\u00a0from the low on March 23. \n \u201cIt\u2019s normal to see a pullback in markets in any environment, especially given the highly uncertain backdrop created by he COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Lesley Marks, chief investment officer at BMO Private Wealth. \u201cInvestors are realizing that even though there is optimism for a recovery with easing restrictions globally, the recovery will be slow and not necessarily be a smooth path upward.\u201d \n Reiman noted the uneven performance of various industries. Both growth and defensive sectors, like tech, utilities and consumer staples, had stronger earnings and returns in Canada and globally. Cyclicals like energy and financials experienced sharp earnings downgrades and dividend cuts. \n Markets:\u00a0Just The Numbers \n Stocks \r\n\u2022 Financials, real estate and utility stocks led the declines on the TSX for the week, offset by tech and materials. \n Bonds \r\n\u2022\u00a0The Canadian 10-year bond yield rose to 3.18 per cent, while two-year bond yields climbed 3.95 per cent. \n Loonie \r\n\u2022\u00a0The Canadian dollar weakened by more than one per cent\u00a0against the U.S. dollar this week. \n Getting Defensive \n While markets may have priced in the bad economic data released so far, there\u2019s more to come. \n \u201cOur view is that in the coming months, we\u2019re probably not going to see the same level of policy responses and announcements,\u201d Craig Basinger, chief investment officer at Richardson GMP, said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep throwing a trillion dollars every month at the market. And at the same time, we\u2019re going to start getting more bad more economic and earnings data.\u201d \n Basinger said he has reduced exposure to stocks in his funds and has tilted to a more defensive view. Second quarter-earnings results will be \u201canyone\u2019s guess,\u201d added Chris Kerlow, portfolio manager at Richardson GMP. \n Blackrock\u2019s Reiman prefers U.S. stocks for their greater exposure to companies with strong balance sheets and hefty U.S. fiscal and monetary-policy measures. He also prefers corporate bonds over stocks for higher and more stable income stream. \n Chart of the Week \n \n Economy \n As far as the Bank of Canada is concerned, the country\u2019s financial system remains resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and moves to keep credit markets functioning have been largely effective, though risks remain. The central bank\u2019s balance sheet grew to $416.6 billion, about 18 per cent\u00a0of Canada\u2019s gross domestic product. \n Consumer confidence is showing signs of improving as Canadians\u2019 views on their personal finances, job security and expectations for the economy all improved. \n Earlier this week, Justin Trudeau\u2019s government unveiled a loan program for large companies with annual revenue of $300 million or more that have been hit by COVID-19 and can\u2019t get financing by conventional means. Firms in all sectors can apply for the funding except the finance industry. \n Politics \n The world\u2019s longest undefended border will likely remain shut until late June, according to a newspaper report. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a media briefing this week that Canada will be \u201cvery, very careful about reopening any international travel including the United States.\u201d \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: TSX winning streak; market volatility boosts TMX profit", "description": "Noah Zivitz", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-tsx-winning-streak-market-volatility-boosts-tmx-profit-1.1435014", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n The S&P/TSX Composite Index matched its longest winning streak of the year yesterday, with its sixth straight day of gains.

Details  here. \n IN CONVERSATION WITH TMX CEO \n Market volatility was a profit boon for the TMX Group in the first quarter of the year. Adjusted earnings soared 19 per cent\u00a0year-over-year as revenue rallied 12 per cent. The exchange owner/operator\u2019s core equities and derivatives units were the primary beneficiaries of those breathtaking trading days as COVID-19 took hold.

In a press release this morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the establishment of a Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF). It's a financing mechanism for companies that need the additional support to \"keep their operations going.\" Any company wanting to tap the program will have to file annual climate reports and adhere to \"strict limits to dividends, share buybacks, and executive pay.\" Which raises important questions about who will sign up. \n TSX WINNING STREAK \n The composite index enters this week riding a five-session winning streak. Those gains in every day last week only added up to a 2.37 per cent\u00a0uptick for the TSX, which has now climbed 33 per cent\u00a0off the COVID-era low set on March 23. The info tech group led the way last week (and that wasn\u2019t just a Shopify story), while Air Canada was the TSX\u2019s lead laggard. \n MINING M&A \n We\u2019ve got another at-market deal in the mining sector.

Health care, utilities and financials were the largest percentage decliners. \n Crude prices failed to hang on to gains made earlier in the day, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate shedding 2.4 per cent to trade around US$23.50 per barrel. The declines came after oil\u00a0gained\u00a0as much as 11 per cent in early Thursday\u00a0trading following\u00a0optimism surrounding Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions to support the crude\u00a0market.

On the flip side, health care, information technology and utilities were posting the largest percentage declines. \n On a stock-specific basis, Primo Water Corp. \u2013 formerly known as Cott Beverage \u2013 was the lead gainer on the TSX Composite, up 10 per cent after posting an 11 per cent jump in revenue in its fiscal first quarter. Bombardier Inc. was the worst performing stock on the index, falling 10 per cent after reporting negative free cash flow of US$1.6-billion in its most recent quarter as the global aerospace industry strains under the weight of the COVID-19 virus. \n In all, 136 of the 230 TSX components were in positive territory. \n Crude oil pared earlier gains, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate up about four per cent to trade just shy of US$25 per barrel.

The far more heavily-traded June contract has been down more than 40 per cent\u00a0in early trading amid the great unknown of when COVID-related lockdowns will end. \u201cYou need demand to come back,\u201d energy economist Jan Stuart told us yesterday afternoon. \u201cYou tell me when the public schools will open in California, or New York, or Toronto, and I\u2019ll tell you when demand picks up.\u201d We\u2019ll continue chasing industry and investor insight on the Canadian energy sector\u2019s coping strategy and the implications for the economy, and we look forward to speaking with Natural Resources Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan this afternoon. \n Notable sidebars on topic of easing the lockdown:  The governor of Georgia is loosening his state\u2019s rules this Friday in what could be a case study for other North American jurisdictions.

He said there are ongoing conversations underway with the Texas Railroad Commission and U.S. Department of Energy about the potential for coordinated action in North America to address the storage and pricing problem, while acknowledging \u201cat this point, really, it\u2019s going to be market forces \u2026that inevitably force further shut ins.\u201d \n TSX DEFIES OIL CRASH \n For all the attention focused on crashing oil prices yesterday, the S&P/TSX Composite was the only major North American index to close with a gain. Credit goes to  Shopify , which tacked 41 points onto the index as it rose for an eighth straight session \u2013 over which time it has soared 67.3 per cent\u00a0(and it was adding to those gains after opening higher this morning).

And after CEO Don Lindsay stirred up a frenzy a few weeks ago when he said the ownership group had looked at the possibility of taking the project offline due to weak prices, the miner still isn\u2019t ruling anything out. \u201cThe Fort Hills Partners continue to monitor market conditions and may adjust the operating plan of Fort Hills accordingly,\u201d Teck said in its quarterly report. Overall, the company\u2019s adjusted profit was in line with expectations, albeit down sharply from last year. \u00a0 \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -Air Canada said it will suspend all scheduled service to the United States after April 26 as a result of Canada and the United States\u2019 recent decision to keep border restrictions in place for another 30 days.

The ongoing demand destruction stemming from the forced hibernation of the global economy, concerns over a lack of storage and the looming expiration of the futures contract for May delivery hammered the price of WTI. \n The contract for June delivery of crude held up far better than the May contract, with oil\u2019s longer-dated futures settling closer to US$21 per barrel.

Five of the 11 TSX subgroups were in positive territory, with information technology, materials and health care posting the largest percentage gains. \n Shopify Inc. continued its outperformance, with shares rising about four per cent. The e-commerce platform provider\u2019s market capitalization eclipsed that of Toronto-Dominion Bank to make the company the second-most valuable publicly-traded firm in Canada, trailing only Royal Bank of Canada. \n If Shopify were to surpass RBC, it would mark an exceedingly rare occurrence. Only two technology stocks have ever claimed the largest market capitalization on the TSX: Nortel Networks at the height of the dot-com bubble and BlackBerry \u2013 then Research in Motion \u2013 in 2008.

The S&P/TSX composite index rose 1.72 per cent Thursday, lifted by rising oil prices, while the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite shrugged off earlier losses to post gains of between 1.7 and 2.3 per cent to finish near session highs. \n Crude oil got a bid, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rising more than 20 per cent after U.S President Donald Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia would come to the table to make major output cuts in the range of 10 to 15 million barrels per day, though uncertainty is swirling around whether those cuts will come to fruition. The Saudis and Russians have been locked in an oil price war after Riyadh opened the taps when Moscow refused to curtail production. Alberta\u2019s Western Canadian Select surged 66 per cent, though it remains in the eight-dollar per barrel range. \n That jump in crude price helped lift the Canadian dollar, which rose to 70.72 cents U.S. at 4:45 p.m. ET after flirting with the sub-70 cents level earlier in the day. \n In Toronto, energy, materials and financials added the most points in Thursday\u2019s trade as nine of the composite\u2019s 11 sectors finished in positive territory. MEG Energy Corp, Frontera Energy Corp. and Secure Energy Services Inc. were the largest percentage gainers. Shopify Inc., which had been under pressure from the open after the company pulled its guidance, was the worst performer on the benchmark index. \n \u00a0 \n 1:40 p.m. ET: HL: North American Markets pare gains into the afternoon \n North American equity markets pared earlier gains Thursday afternoon. The S&P/TSX composite index, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all remained in positive territory, but retreated from earlier highs. \n Toronto\u2019s benchmark index was the best performer of the quartet, as rising oil prices lifted the TSX. Energy, materials and financials led the index higher. Torc Oil and Gas Ltd., MEG Energy Corp. and Surge Energy Inc. all posted gains of north of 20 per cent. \n Shopify Inc. remained in the doldrums with a more than 10 per cent decline. \n 10:40 a.m. ET: North American markets rally, oil surges \n North American markets are rallying and oil is surging after U.S. President Donald Trump said he spoke to the Saudis and Russians and expected the two countries to cut crude production by 10 million barrels per day. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 35 per cent in the wake of Trump\u2019s comments. \n In Toronto, that sent energy names dramatically higher. MEG Energy Corp. surged 49 per cent, Paramount Resources Ltd. and Crescent Point Energy Corp. both notched more than 40 per cent gains. \n 9:45 a.m. ET: North American markets were mixed in early trading, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index getting a lift from higher oil prices and the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq losing ground in the wake of the jobless claims report south of the border \n U.S. equity market futures were initially pointing to a rally at the open, but the record 6.65-million jobless claims last week in the U.S. took some of the steam out of that rally. \n Oil prices remained solidly in the green, with the U.S. benchmark West Texas intermediate rallying on reports China is planning to ramp up crude purchases for its strategic reserve in the wake of oil\u2019s epic crash. China is the world\u2019s largest importer of crude, so aggressive purchases could help soak up some of the global supply glut. \n That rally in oil prices wasn\u2019t enough to give the Canadian dollar a lift, with the loonie once again flirting with the 70-cents U.S. level. \n In Toronto, a slate of energy companies was among the lead gainers to start the day, with Nuvista Energy Ltd., Ensign Energy Services Inc. and CES Energy Solutions Corp. posting double-digit gains. \n \n \n \n RELATED \n Markets start the trading day with stocks under pressure  \n \n \n  U.S. stocks rally along with oil; treasuries fall: Markets wrap \n  U.S. jobless claims surge with tally at 10 million in two weeks \n \n \n \n On the flip side, shares of Shopify Inc. fell about six per cent after the company suspended it full-year forecast in the face of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. \n The VIX Index, a widely-followed measure of market volatility, rose in the wake of the record jobless claims report after an initially-muted morning trade. \n The volatility in markets is expected to persist while investors digest the potential impact of the virus outbreak. In an email to BNN Bloomberg, Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, said investors should prepare for wild swings in the current environment. \n \u201cEquity markets are going to be bouncing like a yo-yo for a while yet,\u201d he said. \n \u201cWe are likely to retest the lows a couple of times before this is over.\u00a0 Like any yo-yo, today\u2019s upward lift will be weaker than yesterday\u2019s roll down.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Ian Vandaelle", "title": "'Grim reality' as equity markets close near session lows", "description": "North American equity markets sank deeper into the red to end the first day of the second quarter, settling near session lows.

The Canadian dollar slid against its U.S. counterpart to the low 70-cent U.S. range. \n 10:50 a.m. ET: North American equity markets pare losses in mid-morning \n North American equity markets pared some of their early losses by mid-morning but remained firmly in negative territory amid concerns over the fallout of the COVID-19 virus. The S&P/TSX composite index, S&P 500, Dow Industrials and the Nasdaq were all down more than two per cent after falling more than three per cent at the opening bells. \n In Toronto, 10 of the 11 subgroups were trading lower, with the materials group bucking the trend.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Americans should brace for a \u201cpainful two weeks\u201d as officials forecast hundreds of thousands of deaths in total due to the virus. \n In Europe, a string of Purchasing Managers' Indexes were deep in contraction territory. The U.K.\u2019s big banks,\u00a0including HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc, axed dividend payments and share buybacks, sending the European banks index lower. \n Crude oil prices had a volatile morning amid those economic concerns, the expiration of the OPEC+ production curtailment agreement and the ongoing price war between Saudi Arabia\u00a0and Russia. Saudi Arabia\u2019s production surged to more than 12 million barrels per day, though Russia said it would not boost output. \n In Toronto, it was another day of companies shelving their forecasts in the wake of the uncertainty caused by the virus. \n \n \n \n MARKET MOVES \n  U.S. stocks tumble, bonds rise on shutdown concerns \n  'Soul-sucking experience': Energy batters TSX in 2020's first quarter \n  Bay Street to young investors: Gear up to buy stocks \n \n \n \n Teck Resources\u00a0Ltd.\u00a0suspended its full-year guidance and announced it has put construction activity at its QB2 project in Chile on hold, with no certainty on the timeline to resume construction.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index capped off the first quarter down 21.59 per cent, the 41st best performer among 88 global stock exchanges tracked by Bloomberg. Every single one of them ended the quarter in the red as the world economy began to grind to a halt in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, reflecting the flight to safety that took stocks out at the knees. Botswana came the closest to positive territory, sliding only 0.09 per cent, while Argentina\u2019s Merval Index plummeted nearly 42 per cent. \n None of the TSX subsectors finished the quarter in positive territory, with a one-two punch of the pandemic and fallout from the oil-price war hammering Canada\u2019s benchmark index. Even the materials sector failed to get a bid, in spite of gold\u2019s status as a safe-haven play in times of uncertainty. Below, BNN Bloomberg takes stock of the quarter that was. \n Losers: \n Energy:  -38.2 per cent \n Health Care:  -37.3 per cent \n Consumer Discretionary:  - 33.3 per cent \n Energy stocks were sent to the mat as the COVID-19 crisis and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia battered sentiment around energy. Global oil demand is widely expected to fall by 15 to 20 million barrels a day as those twin headwinds take their toll. West Texas Intermediate crude booked its worst quarter on record, and Western Canadian Select prices fell below US$5 per barrel to hit a new all-time low. \n Ninepoint Partners senior portfolio manager Eric Nuttall said the first quarter of 2020 will go down in the record books. In an email to BNN Bloomberg, Nuttall said the devastation in the energy industry is unlikely to be forgotten any time soon. \n \u201cThe first quarter for energy investors was by any measure an agonizing, soul-sucking experience that saw oil fall by over 60 per cent and industry stalwarts such as Suncor Energy Inc. and Cenovus Energy Inc. fall by as much as 20 per cent to 50 per cent in a single day. There was nowhere to hide,\u201d he said. \u201cWith oil falling to levels that are forcing shut-ins, we await global oil demand to recover as COVID-19\u2019s devastating economic impact lessens. One thing is clear: the oil abundance of today will lead to an oil supply crisis in the years ahead.\u201d \n Health Care, now dominated by the volatile cannabis stocks, was almost equally damaged. Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Hexo Corp. were the biggest losers, with the former seeing its share price cut in half and the latter losing almost 45 per cent of its value. \n Purpose Investments chief investment officer Greg Taylor, who manages the firm\u2019s Marijuana Opportunities Fund, said he anticipates the crisis will quickly separate the winners and losers in the sector. In an email to BNN Bloomberg, Taylor said the uneven performance of individual companies will bear out in the coming weeks and months. \n \u201cMany companies continue to fail to hit targets and are at risk of running out of funds. We continue to expect more consolidation and bankruptcies in the sector as the year progresses,\u201d he said. \n \u201cLong term the prospects remain strong for the winners in this group but governments will be focused on other areas of higher importance for the next while and that may delay the long awaited broader rollout of stores throughout the country and a full rollout of cannabis 2.0 products.\u201d \n Other thoughts: \n Karl Berger, senior wealth consultant, Cidel Asset Management: \n \u201cHistoric.\u00a0No more uncertain than 2008, but a lot of people have forgotten that markets can be really volatile, and in some ways a reminder for equity investors that occasionally bad things happen.\u201d\u00a0 \n \u201cBut out of chaos comes opportunity, and it feels a bit like 2008 in that regard as well. There are many companies that offer fantastic, sustainable dividend yields and that will provide investors with income for the next decade.\u00a0I guess that\u2019s more about the period going forward than it is about the past, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m looking!\u201d \n Brian Belski, chief investment strategist, BMO Capital Markets: \n \u201cA month to forget and a Spring to look forward to. The fastest bear market in history took place in March, an unprecedented period that could result in an unprecedented recovery. After all, bull markets are born from bears.\u201d \n Brian Madden, senior vice president and portfolio manager, Goodreid Investment Management: \n \u201cI\u2019d characterize it as the fastest bear market to unfold on record, with widespread damage to the economy and the stock markets, but mitigated somewhat by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus in virtually all developed economies.\u00a0We think the initial shock and panic phase has subsided, and an interim recovery has taken hold, but we expect aftershocks to reverberate for a few months.\u201d\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Jeremy Herron and Vildana Hajric", "title": "U.S. stocks fall, bonds rise with wild quarter wnding", "description": "U.S. stocks sank, bulging the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s loss in the quarter to a level not seen since 1987 as the pandemic almost certainly plunged the American economy into recession.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-stocks-fall-bonds-rise-with-wild-quarter-wnding-1.1414838", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 31, 2020", "content": "U.S. stocks sank, bulging the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s loss in the quarter to a level not seen since 1987 as the pandemic almost certainly plunged the American economy into recession. \n The blue-chip index tumbled 23 per cent\u00a0in the three months, closing the period with a 1.9 per cent\u00a0drop. The S&P 500 fared little better, even after a furious, weeklong 17 per cent\u00a0rally that halted Tuesday. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell least among major indexes, as dip-buyers targeted the cash-rich tech megacaps that make up its core. \n There was almost nowhere to hide for Dow investors, as all but one of the 30 members ended lower for the year. Boeing plunged 54 per cent, while Chevron and Exxon sank at least 39 per cent\u00a0after oil suffered its worst quarterly beatdown on record. Microsoft fared best, ending higher by 0.01 per cent. \n Risk assets around the world tumbled in the period as governments instituted unprecedented shutdowns in large swaths of the global economy to combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Massive government spending and monetary stimulus lifted U.S. stocks from a rout that reached 33 per cent, but the hit to GDP is shaping up to be monumental, with Goldman Sachs now forecasting a 34 per cent\u00a0contraction in the second quarter before a sharp rebound. \n As March ends, here are some of the major quartlery moves: \n \n The record bull market in U.S. stocks turned into a bear market on March 12, 11 years and three days after the last one ended. \n Bloomberg\u2019s U.S.\u00a0dollar index surged\u00a0six per cent, most since 2016, even after tumbling more than\u00a0three per cent\u00a0since March 23. \n The Cboe Volatility Index averaged 57.1 in March, triple the mean in the prior decade. \n European shares plunged more than 20 per cent\u00a0for the worst three months since 2002. Spain lost 30 per cent. \n West Texas oil lost 65 per cent, the worst quarter on record. \n The 10-year Treasury yield hit 1.94 per cent\u00a0on Jan. 20. It fell to 0.31 per cent\u00a0by March 9 and is just over 0.6 per cent\u00a0now. \n Gold topped US$1,700 in early March before plunging US$200 an ounce. It\u2019s on track for a sixth quarterly gain. \n China\u2019s Shanghai Composite lost 10 per cent, while Tokyo\u2019s Topix fell almost 20 per cent\u00a0in its worst three months since 2008. \n Copper fell 23 per cent\u00a0and nickel lost 19 per cent, both most since 2011. \n The pound fell more than\u00a0six per cent, while the yen was virtually flat versus the U.S. dollar. \n South Africa\u2019s rand had its worst quarter since 2001 and Mexico\u2019s peso fell the most since 2008. \n \n On Tuesday, investors focused on signs that Congress could deliver a fourth round of stimulus as the virus spreads deeper in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking a US$2 trillion infrastructure package. Treasuries edged higher, while the U.S. dollar fell and crude pushed back above US$20 a barrel. \n Investors are at a crossroads, questioning whether extraordinary stimulus by countries and central banks can counter further retrenchment of firms and consumers as the outbreak spreads. \n New York City, which is emerging as the new epicenter of the pandemic, reported a 16 per cent\u00a0increase in deaths in six hours. Italy and the Netherlands are considering extending lockdowns, and Spain\u2019s 849 deaths were the most in one day for the country. \n \u201cThe recent market movements do reflect efforts to factor in what has happened on the pandemic control side of things and the stimulus measures,\u201d Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certain that we\u2019ll continue to see volatility.\u201d \n In Europe, the Stoxx 600 rose and a measure of corporate-credit stress eased. Equities were mixed in Asia, where China had stronger-than-anticipated manufacturing data. The U.S. dollar rose versus the euro. \n In China, the official purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 52.0 this month. That\u2019s up from a record low of 35.7 in February and above the 50 mark which signals improving conditions. Still, the country\u2019s bureau of statistics cautioned that the single-month data didn\u2019t necessarily mean that economy has returned to normal level amid continuing coronavirus concerns. \n These are the main moves in markets: \n Stocks \n \n The S&P 500 Index fell 1.7 per cent\u00a0as of 3:20 p.m. New York time. \n The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 0.2 per cent. \n The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.6 per cent. \n The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 per cent. \n \n Currencies \n \n The Bloomberg U.S.\u00a0Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1 per cent. \n The euro declined 0.3 per cent\u00a0to US$1.1013. \n The British pound was little changed at US$1.2414. \n The Japanese yen gained 0.1 per cent\u00a0to 107.83 per U.S. dollar. \n \n Bonds \n \n The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 0.69 per cent. \n Germany\u2019s 10-year yield climbed by two basis points to -0.46 per cent. \n \n Commodities \n \n Gold sank 2.4 per cent\u00a0to US$1,604.30 an ounce. \n West Texas Intermediate crude increased 3.1 to US$20.75 a barrel. \n \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Ian Vandaelle", "title": "TSX rallies, U.S. markets fall in divergent Tuesday", "description": "North American equity markets diverged in Tuesday\u2019s trade, with Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index posting strong gains while indices south of the border lost ground.

On the flip side, cannabis stocks were smacked, with Hexo Corp. posting the largest loss on the composite, followed by Aurora Cannabis Inc. \n Among the other sharp declines, shares of Cineplex Inc. plunged deeper into the red after JPMorgan analyst Alexander Mees cast serious doubt on the timeline for the company to sell itself to U.K.-based Cineworld Group plc. In a note to clients, Mees said he \u201ccannot envisage a realistic scenario\u201d where the deal could be completed in the first half of this year as the theatre industry grapples with shutdowns due to the virus outbreak. Cineplex reached a deal to sell itself to Cineworld last year for $34 per share. \n Other losers included Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust, whose units suffered after the company pulled its financial forecast for fiscal 2020 late Friday in the face of the virus. The company, which has office, industrial and retail exposure, said mandated shutdowns of non-essential businesses could hurt its retail unit. It also shelved any planned asset sales in the face of real estate market uncertainty. \n Inter Pipeline Ltd. shares also fell after the company slashed its dividend 72 per cent, citing the one-two punch of the virus outbreak and the oil price war. The company concurrently cut executive pay and put its plans to sell its European bulk storage business on ice in the face of the uncertainty. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Ian Vandaelle", "title": "'Don\u2019t be a hero': Market veterans weigh in on managing volatility", "description": "It\u2019s been a wild week for Canadian investors.

There\u2019s also been volatility in the bond market as investors seek safe havens and weigh central bank rate cuts designed to cushion the blow from the COVID-19 outbreak. \n Here\u2019s a look at some recommendations from top investment professionals on what to do, and what not to do, in these volatile times. \n David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist, Rosenberg Research & Associates: \n \u201cThere are true bargains out there in areas of the equity market that were the proverbial \u2018babies thrown out with the bathwater\u2019 in the recent meltdown that have strong underlying fundamentals and solid recurring cash flow streams.\u00a0 I am thinking multi-family REITS, utilities and telecom; and each company you buy should be screened for balance sheet strength.\u00a0 \n \u201cCanada\u2019s recession is going to be even deeper and the recovery shallower, and there are precious few alluring investment themes here at home compared to what you can pick and choose from south of the border.\u00a0For yield, I would suggest moving out of G7 bond markets and into the emerging market fixed-income universe where the basis-point pickup is considerable.\u00a0I would definitely avoid any company that is the recipient of bailout money and any company that artificially engineered its earnings via share buybacks in the last bull market.\u201d \n Mark Wiseman, former Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CEO \n \u201cThese are very difficult times for even the most experienced investors. \u2026 It is extremely difficult to time markets. Trying to time these markets is a fool\u2019s errand, you just don\u2019t know where things will go. \u2026 It\u2019s hard, and you just to have to take that long-term view. It\u2019s impossible to be an automaton. In the investment horizon most people have, you have to avoid deviating from your principles. A day\u2019s trading, an hour\u2019s trading, it doesn\u2019t matter. You need a long view if you\u2019re an investor, not a trader. Stick to you knitting, don\u2019t panic and try to keep a cool head.\u201d \n Brian Belski, chief investment strategist, BMO Capital Markets: \n \u201cI\u2019ve called for a 40-to-50-per-cent rally from the lows. I think the lows are in, though timing remains fluid on when things rebound. \n \u201cMy favourite sector is communications. This is a changing world \u2013 people are going to be glued to the couch at home. People are watching Netflix, they\u2019re watching Disney +, they\u2019re watching YouTube. These are opportunities. In terms of the worse thing [investors] can do, they should not be selling now, they should not be getting into fixed income. Bull markets are born of bear markets.\u201d \n Kurt Reiman, chief investment strategist, Blackrock Canada \n \u201cIn our tactical asset allocation framework, we focus on four equity style factors: momentum, value, quality and minimum volatility. These last two \u2013 quality (companies with sound balance sheets) and minimum volatility (companies that have historically exhibited lower volatility) \u2013 tend to perform best during periods of either slow economic growth, like the period that prevailed prior to the coronavirus outbreak, or during a contraction in activity like now. We\u2019re overweight both positions in our factor exposure framework.\u201d \n Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer and portfolio manager, Baskin Wealth Management \n \u201cIf there were good reasons why you bought everything in your portfolio and you can justify that those companies will be here for the long term, then do nothing. I have no doubt that a number of companies won\u2019t ever regain their lofty highs but it is too soon to make that kind of decision. Doing nothing and holding on is the right decision and it is a powerful action. You must tame your animal brain and think rationally. \n \u201cIf you have cash, scale into this market. Don\u2019t be a hero and spend it all in one day. If you are retired or close to retirement, take out a year\u2019s worth of cash flow from your portfolio to tide you over.\u201d \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "'Through thick and thin': Why stock markets will likely remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic", "description": "David George-Cosh", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/through-thick-and-thin-why-stock-markets-will-likely-remain-open-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-1.1413566", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 27, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                David George-Cosh\n                             \n Reporter   Follow | Archive \n \n \n With the COVID-19 pandemic prompting frequent waves of volatility on North American stock markets, some uneasy investors may want this month's rollercoaster ride to end to avoid risking further losses.\u00a0 \n But halting all stock market activity isn't that easy. The lessons learned from the last financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 ensured that markets will continue to trade, like it or not.\u00a0 \n \"Even in a time of stress, the importance of people having liquidity and with companies being able to access capital, those are critical functions for the marketplace to offer,\" said John McKenzie, interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the TMX Group Ltd, in a phone interview with BNN Bloomberg.\u00a0 \n The last time U.S. and Canadian stock exchanges shut down was during a four-day period after 9/11 when markets shuttered in anticipation of panic selling and chaos following the terrorist attacks on the U.S. \n But with fears about how bad the COVID-19 pandemic could get and policymakers around the world enacting extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures to prop economies up, U.S. and Canadian stock markets have frequently hit circuit breakers over the past month, halting trading activity and letting investors take a breather.\u00a0 \n One\u00a0Bay Street portfolio manager thinks the COVID-19 pandemic should pause all trading until the virus is properly managed. \n Patrick Horan, portfolio manager at Toronto-based Agilith Capital Inc., told BNN Bloomberg earlier this month that everyone needs to \"collectively stop the economic engine\" to eliminate COVID-19 as fast as possible. \n \"The problem is that markets are still open and [investors] are\u00a0going: 'Who\u2019s going to pay for this?,'\" Horan said during a television interview. \n \"It\u2019s going to be one heck of a mess.\" \n \n \n \n RELATED  \n  Mnuchin wants U.S. markets open, with shorter hours if necessary \n  Damage control: Inside the TSX's 34% slide from record high  \n  'Markets are functioning well': TMX CEO calls for trading to continue amid crash \n \n \n \n That market chatter led the TMX Group to issue a rare response\u00a0 on its website last week \u00a0to let investors know it was in the best interest of publicly-listed companies, investors and other participants for markets to remain open.\u00a0 \n To help contain investors' frustration amid volatile markets, exchanges established circuit breakers after the 2008 financial crisis. The  benchmark  for the first breaker to be triggered is when an index falls more than seven per cent. \n That was one\u00a0of the first takeaways made after that financial crisis\u00a0to avoid a repeat of the same violent whipsaw of trading activity, according to Susan Wolburgh Jenah, the former president and CEO of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and current board member of the NEO Exchange.\u00a0 \n \"This has always been sacrosanct, but it's better to have the markets working. It's important to have markets remain operational through thick and thin,\" Jenah told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview.\u00a0 \n Shutting down stock exchanges was viewed as \"the equivalent of the nuclear bomb in terms of how markets operate,\" Jenah said. She added there\u00a0were daily discussions between herself, the Bank of Canada, provincial and federal finance departments and securities regulators to determine the next steps for market activity during the tumultuous 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0 \n \"Is there a single blueprint that gets triggered? Every crisis is different and every set of circumstances will have their own nuances,\" she said. \"There's an apparatus through working with these issues but it involves a lot of conversations and a lot of analysis.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Investing\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1413012 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1413012', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1929467, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 'It will take two to three years before you get money back in the markets': U.S. equity strategist   \n Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss his outlook on the markets amid COVID-19.   \n \n McKenzie said that ultimately\u00a0it's up to U.S. and Canadian securities regulators, finance officials and central bank leadership teams\u00a0to determine whether the markets should stop and pause, not the exchanges themselves.\u00a0 \n But given how intertwined each exchange is with inter-listed stocks, and the amount of backups made to ensure traders and investors can still facilitate trades, it's unlikely to ever happen again, he said, because those redundancies didn't exist when the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led markets to close.\u00a0 \n \"There were brokers and dealers who couldn't connect anymore, they didn't have the staff anymore,\" McKenzie said. \"You had a question mark about whether you could operate a fair market with integrity when participants couldn't access it. That's what drove that decision.\" \n McKenzie said the TMX Group has multiple sites and several backups in place in case another major event leads to any issues with the main exchange unable to conduct trades.

However,\u00a0there\u2019s still lots of uncertainty about how long the pandemic will last as well as the breadth of the economic recovery. \n Stewart believes there\u2019s still more bad news to come, but suggests young investors take a gradual approach over the next three to nine months to buy stocks. \n He said\u00a0when the correction began, companies and industries directly impacted by the virus sold off immediately but in the days and weeks after, share prices of very stable businesses such as REITs, renewable power companies and consumer staples also fell. \n \u201cEven\u00a0with this virus, industries\u00a0have revenue, contracts and demand for their products, so when you start seeing\u00a0those more stable businesses being sold off really hard, I think for us that was more interesting.

Potential investors should look at things like the quality of the balance sheet, cash flow growth, management team and the overall valuation, before investing,\u201d she said. \u201cI would recommend young individuals start with a small position in a few names and add to those positions as we get more comfortable with the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy.\u201d \n Two big issues for young investors to consider are if they have\u00a0near-term needs for the cash and their job security during the pandemic. \n \u201cIf your job is secure, then saving is still the modus operandi and the stock market is the best place to be. If not, don\u2019t even think about investing in the market,\"\u00a0David Driscoll, chief executive officer of Liberty International Investment Management, said. \"You have more important things to think about, such as getting firm employment when this is over. The stock market will always be there when you\u2019re ready to invest.\" \n \u201cNever give me money to invest that you\u2019re going to want back in the near future.

Only put away money that you don\u2019t plan to touch until retirement.\u201d \n Driscoll suggested that\u00a0young investors\u00a0automatically transfer money\u00a0into an investment account and avoid\u00a0investing money aimed\u00a0for a down payment on a house, as well as\u00a0prioritizing paying down their \u200bmortgage over investing. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": "Ross Marowits", "title": "North American markets cap first winning week since February despite snapping rally", "description": "TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index capped its first winning week since mid-February despite snapping a three-day rally as cases of COVID-19 continue to soar.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/north-american-markets-cap-first-winning-week-since-february-despite-snapping-rally-1.1413420", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 27, 2020", "content": "TORONTO -- Canada's main stock index capped its first winning week since mid-February despite snapping a three-day rally as cases of COVID-19 continue to soar. \n The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 683.43 points, or 5.1 per cent, at 12,687.74. The market gained seven per cent in the week thanks to a 19.1 per cent increase over three days. But it still remained more than 29 per cent off the peak set Feb. 20. \n \"It's been a nice week, but it's been a pretty brutal month,\" said Macan Nia, senior investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management. \n In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 915.39 points at 21,636.78. The S&P 500 index was down 88.60 points at 2,541.47, while the Nasdaq composite was down 295.16 points at 7,502.38. \n It's not unexpected that the very short winning streak would come to an end after the largest increase since the early 1930s, said Nia. \n \"We saw a bit of a relief rally because markets don't move in straight lines and one should probably anticipate there to be bear market rallies that we saw over the past couple days during these prolonged dislocations,\" he said. \n In the 11 bear markets since the 1970s, six included a recession where the average selloff from the peak was 40 per cent, about 20 per cent more than when there's no recession. \n A material impact on economic activity is expected with mass parts of the world in quarantine to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, said Nia. \n \"History would suggest and probability would suggest that there's likely more downside ahead before we can create a sustainable bottom and a sustainable rally coming out of that.\" \n He said the upswing is unlikely until there's more clarity that the virus has peaked and the curve has flattened. \n The Canadian dollar gained to trade for 71.14 cents US compared with an average of 71.04 cents US on Thursday despite the Bank of Canada's decision to cut its key rate by half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent. \n Nia said that's because a rate cut was expected after the U.S. Federal Reserve made its move earlier. \n Ten of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were lower, the exception being real estate. \n Energy was the biggest loser with the sector falling 9.4 per cent as lower crude oil and natural gas prices pushed Seven Generations Energy Ltd. and Whitecap Resources Inc. down 17.5 and 15.2 per cent respectively. \n The May crude contract was down US$1.09 at US$21.51 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was down 1.8 cents at US$1.67 per mmBTU. \n Crude prices fell on weaker demand as more people are house bound, and a failed attempt to convince Saudi Arabia and Russia to end their price war. \n The materials sector dropped six per cent led by a 14.3 per drop by Teck Resources Ltd. \n The June gold contract was down US$6.20 at US$1,654.10 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 0.6 of a cent at US$2.17 a pound. \n The heavyweight financials sector was also lower due to reduced interest rates and the risk of a severe recession, said Nia. \n \"That will be a headwind for financial earnings moving forward.\" \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Noah Zivitz", "title": "TSX flirts with bull market in 'welcome relief rally' after crash", "description": "The S&P/TSX Composite Index managed to string together a third straight day of gains Thursday, but fell just short of closing in bull market territory.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tsx-flirts-with-bull-market-in-welcome-relief-rally-after-crash-1.1412759", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 26, 2020", "content": "The S&P/TSX Composite Index managed to string together a third straight day of gains Thursday, but fell just short of closing in bull market territory. \n Earlier in the session, the index rose more than 20 per cent from the depths it crashed to earlier this week amid the COVID-19 global health crisis. \n The benchmark index closed 1.77 per cent higher Thursday, after jumping as much as 3.45 per cent in morning trading, and is into its longest winning streak since Feb. 20 when it closed at a record of 17,944.06.\u00a0 \n Over a three-day span through the end of trading Thursday, only two members of the index \u2014 Cargojet Inc. and Fronterra Energy Corp. \u2014 are in the red. \n \"Indeed, this has been a welcome relief rally for investors,\" said Andrew Pyle, senior wealth advisor and portfolio manager for The Pyle Group at Scotia Wealth Management. \"Personally, I would prefer to see less magnitudes in the swings, as this would be more constructive in helping develop a base, if indeed we are forming one.\" \n As of Thursday's closing bell, the TSX leaders board since the end of trading Monday included names like Chorus Aviation Inc.

On the former, we should be doing a good job in pre-educating investors of these numbers and putting them in perspective; however, there is no such pre-educating on the virus. If containment and social distancing does not produce a curve which shows [COVID-19] is\u00a0resolved\u00a0by the summer, then economists are going to take two-quarter recession forecasts and turn them into one-year [forecasts]. In that case, this would not be a bottom.\" \n Karl Berger, senior wealth consultant and director, Cidel Asset Management: \n \"I don\u2019t think anyone should get too enamoured with short term moves - up or down - because we\u2019re simply in a completely uncertain period of time. For the TSX to have been down 37 per cent at one point implies a level of concern over future prospects we don\u2019t feel is justified based on fundamentals, while completely acknowledging that we really don\u2019t know what those fundamentals will look like in the short-to-medium term. \n \"We have been buying, in particular in terms of switching clients out of bonds and into equities (and we aren\u2019t finished yet, but will take a breather during this rally). Three days ago, you could sell the ten-year bond of a blue chip Canadian company and forgo a 3.2 per cent yield, buy their common stock at a six per cent yield and almost double your cash flow. That\u2019s a trade I would do any day of the week.\" \n Brian Madden, senior vice-president and portfolio manager, Goodreid Investment Counsel: \n \"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re out of the woods yet, and likely won\u2019t be until we see some abatement in the health risk. As for the markets, we\u2019re hopeful that the raw fear and panic phase may be abating, but it\u2019s not unusual for markets to make an initial low, followed by a sharp rally and then retrace much of the rally over the coming days and weeks. \n \"Trying to pick a precise bottom is a fool\u2019s game, but we like the prices we\u2019re seeing across a lot of stocks today and think intrinsic values, which stock prices follow in the long term, are higher than current prices. With that said, my colleague Gordon Reid, who manages our U.S. equity mandates, added a large bank to portfolios yesterday, and we\u2019re sizing up a few names for purchase in Canada as well, with the unifying themes among all of them being quality, industry leadership/competitive advantage and financial strength. This is not the time to be a hero and blindly buy all of the beat-up cyclicals.\" \n Bryden Teich, portfolio manager, Avenue Investment Management: \n \"Whenever the market experiences violent moves downward, it is normal to expect days or weeks where the market bounces higher as new buyers re-enter the market. Over the past few weeks, countries around the world have taken unprecedented steps to shut down economies to halt the spread of the virus. It is uncertain how long the economic damage will last, so we are not changing our longer-term view and process based on any given day or week. \n \"Our strategy has been to be buyers of stocks we like on really horrible days in the markets, and on days where the market rallies we have lightened up on non-core positions. The Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented steps over the last two weeks to aid with the carnage in the bond market. But the Federal Reserve can\u2019t stop an underlying recession by printing money. There is a corporate debt bubble that is unwinding in the United States which will take months and quarters to work its way through the system.

Among the key takeaways: he acknowledged the U.S. \u201cmay well be in a recession\u201d now and that \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d what the economic recovery on the other side of the health crisis will look like (though he repeatedly stated his belief that confidence will bounce back). He also declared that his central will not run out of \u201cammunition.\u201d\u00a0This is a good opportunity to point out a record 3.3 million initial jobless claims were filed in the U.S. last week, according to data released this morning.\u00a0 \n TSX IN PERSPECTIVE \n The S&P/TSX composite index is coming off its first back-to-back gains since it climbed to a record on Feb. 20 and has rallied 17 per cent\u00a0over the last two sessions. Amazingly, only one index member (Waste Connections) is underwater over that two-day stretch, and the leaders board includes some stunning gains, led by Chorus Aviation\u2019s 66.8 per cent\u00a0surge. Even so, perspective is everything: the TSX enters today down 26.8 per cent\u00a0from last month\u2019s all-time high. \n GLOBAL STOCKS SLUMP \n Almost every major overseas index is trading lower as of the time of this writing, and U.S. futures are pointing to a weak open, as the enthusiasm about global stimulus efforts wanes while the Americans\u2019 US$2-trillion package heads to the House of Representatives after it cleared the Senate overnight. Our Bloomberg partners are reporting the House is likely to vote tomorrow. We will be on the lookout for any commentary from today\u2019s G20 summit that could reignite optimism. \n ONEX CEO READY TO \u201cSEIZE OPPORTUNITIES\u201d \n The Canadian private equity giant isn\u2019t hiding from the fact it will take some hits from the crisis, but its founder and CEO also wants shareholders to know that it\u2019s well-equipped to manage the turmoil. And it\u2019s also ready to pounce. \u201cOur ability to maintain our dividends, to survive a crisis and to seize opportunities is not in question,\u201d wrote Gerry Schwartz in a letter released late yesterday, in which he underscored the value of having plenty of cash in times like this and hence \u201cnever (being) a forced seller.\u201d \n OTHER NOTABLE COVID-19 CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS \n -Norbord is taking out a quarter of its North American operating capacity, while saying it\u2019s aiming to \u201cpreserve jobs for as many employees as possible\u201d. It\u2019s also reducing this year\u2019s capital budget by 25 per cent. Meanwhile, West Fraser Timber also announced additional curtailments last night.\u00a0 \n -The Green Organic Dutchman is pointing to the virus outbreak as one of the reasons for a slew of cost-saving measures announced last night.

The S&P 500 index was up 28.23 points at 2,475.56, while the Nasdaq composite was down 33.56 points at 7,384.29. \n The relief rally began in overnight markets after the U.S. Congress agreed to a US$2 trillion stimulus package to complement Federal Reserve support. \n Wednesday's approval by the House of Commons of an $82-billion package also helped the TSX. \n \"The passing of the baton to fiscal stimulus that's really buoying sentiment these days,\" said Bangsund. \n The Canadian dollar gained nearly one cent to trade for 69.92 cents US compared with an average of 69.01 cents US on Tuesday. \n Ten of the 11 sectors of the TSX were higher as several companies enjoyed very big days. \n The energy sector rose more than eight per cent as Arc Resources Ltd. and Vermilion Energy Inc. were up about 21 and 20 per cent respectively on higher crude oil prices. \n The May crude contract was up 48 cents at US$24.49 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was down 1.5 cents at US$1.71 per mmBTU. \n The heavyweight financials sector increased 6.7 per cent with Laurentian and National banks each gaining about 11 per cent. \n Bangsund said cyclical sectors that were hit the hardest during the downturn were among the leaders during the risk-on trade. \n \"And that is largely why the TSX is outperforming so drastically due to the sizable exposures in both of both of those sectors,\" she said. \n Industrials inched up slightly despite a 28.5 per cent gain for Chorus Aviation Holdings Inc. and 25.6 per cent rise by NFI Group Inc.

The energy sector has been sent to the mat, losing half of its value amid concerns over falling crude demand due to the virus and the oil price war launched by Saudi Arabia hammering the Canadian producers in an unprecedented manner. \n The health care names have been hard hit as well. The sector, which is dominated by volatile cannabis stocks, has plunged deep into a bear market under current conditions.

Energy services company Shawcor lost nearly 90 per cent of its value after suspending its dividend in the face of the crisis, sending shares plunging. Shares of Vermilion plunged after the company, which has production in Southwest Saskatchewan and Europe, slashed its dividend. Whitecap, Cenovus and Secure were similarly caught up in the damage. \n While the TSX energy index is under pronounced pressure, Ninepoint Partners partner and senior portfolio manager Eric Nuttall said he expects a strong recovery once fundamentals solidify. \n \u201cWe are literally in the valley of death for Canadian energy, but those [companies] with good hedges can make it out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Canadian energy industry is under severe pressure, but it will survive.\u201d \n Nuttall said he thinks mid-cap companies will see the biggest rebound in any rally. \n In the wake of the selloff, investment industry professionals are urging calm.

The S&P 500 index was down 104.47 points at 2,304.92, while the Nasdaq composite was down 271.06 points at 6,879.52. \n Trading was influenced by it being quad witching, the third Friday of each month when all options expire.

Its move higher could be a sign that investors are feeling the selling has gone too far, said Taylor. \n \"And when people are starting to do the fundamental analysis to realize that this is not the end of the world to all these sectors and things start to rebound, that's a really good sign that sentiment is starting to change and people are starting to have sober second thoughts,\" he said. \n The energy sector gained with Baytex Energy Corp. up 15 per cent despite lower crude prices. \n The May crude contract was down US$3.28 at US$22.63 per barrel after gaining more than 24 per cent on Thursday. The May natural gas contract was down 5.1 cents at US$1.675 per mmBTU. \n Crude oil prices fell by nearly 29 per cent during the week on concerns about weakened demand as people stay home to prevent the virus from spreading, and increased supply due to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. \n Notwithstanding Friday's trading, the market feels calmer with more people calling looking to put money to work, Taylor said. \n The tricky part for investors is trying to determine how much of the bad news is already priced in. \n He said investors have to look beyond the sad news of rising virus infections and deaths. \n \"It's important to remember that markets are supposed to be forward looking.

The latter, on Thursday, was the biggest one-day percentage decline since at least 1977 when the first major index on the exchange was launched. \n The volatility hasn\u2019t been surprising to Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management who\u2019s studied the markets ebbs and flows. From the 1940s to the late 1980s, a generally stable political environment provided the basis for a long-term rise in equities, he said. \n \u201cWe\u2019re in the cold war and there\u2019s U.S. internationalism in the free-market countries that dictates a market that\u2019s delivering pretty solid, steady returns,\u201d said Anastakis, who holds the L.R.

The inclines have become sharper. So have the slumps. \n Anastakis points to the Mexican peso crisis, Russian default, the Long Term Credit Management debacle, the tech wreck and the 2008 financial crisis as some of the shocks that have wracked markets over that time. \n The democratization of the stock market and advent of 24-hour business news has only inflamed the volatility, he said. \u201cI know this is going to be a terrible analogy but it\u2019s kind of how the weather channel freaks people out every time there\u2019s a snowmaggedon,\u201d Anastakis said. \u201cIt puts us on this roller coaster.\u201d \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Investing\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1405030 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1405030', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1921124, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Markets will bounce back from COVID-19 in one or two quarters: Jay Bala \n Jay Bala, senior portfolio manager at AIP Asset Management, gives his take on the COVID-19 selloff. \n \n While these new factors are affecting all stock markets, Canada has its own Achilles heel -- a big weighting to the energy industry in the index. At about 13 per cent, down from 15 per cent since the rout, it is the biggest in the Group of Seven. \n That has swelled as the country\u2019s manufacturing base has shrunk. Unlike in the U.S. where technology has become a mighty force, there hasn\u2019t been a lot to take its place. Canada\u2019s economy has been driven by a consumer and spending boom for years with productivity middling and few companies of much substance listing on the stock market. \n Anastakis noted that oil was tumbling this week as Bombardier Inc. replaced its chief executive officer, the latest chapter on the company\u2019s dramatic retrenchment which has seen it cede its marquee jet program and sell off its rail business. \n \u201cI was in my MBA class talking about it saying, this is bleak,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last kind of international manufacturing entity of real substance in Canada is probably Magna,\u201d he said referring to the Aurora, Ontario-based auto parts maker. \n Anastakis believes the hit to globalization from the coronavirus and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war may permanently change the way economies and societies function. \u201cAs quickly as we create networks, they can be destructed,\u201d he said. \n But markets?

Mack added he didn\u2019t think the 10-year yield would turn negative in Canada or the U.S. \n Pelletier agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a 2008 event as this isn\u2019t a liquidity crisis and central banks will ensure the orderly flow of capital and money within markets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if more thought of it this way then perhaps they would be acting differently with their portfolios.\u201d \n Keep Calm & Seek Guidance \n \u201cOur clients are not hitting the panic button but they are looking for guidance. Despite the sharp daily moves in the equity markets, valuations are not yet back to long term averages nor are they at levels, where we would be advocating buying this dip,\u201d said Kevin Headland, senior investment strategist at Manulife Investments in Toronto. \n \u201cShould this environment result in a recession, then there is likely more downside to come, and clients should prepare their portfolios for that risk,\u201d he said. \n Geof Marshall, chief of credit at Toronto-based CI Investments, said he\u2019s seen some inbound inquiries from clients. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the retail investor panicking. And this feels like what market pukes feel like: trying to make informed decisions with imperfect information.\u201d \n If you were drowning in a sea of global news, here\u2019s a look at some of the other Canadian events that took place this week. \n Chart of the Week \n \n Economy & Politics \n Governor Stephen Poloz defended the central bank from the criticism its most aggressive move in more than a decade may fuel already dangerously high household debt levels, while doing little to solve the underlying problems associated with the spread of the virus. He also left the door open to further rate cuts. \n In economic data that came through this week, Canada\u2019s job market strengthened for a third-straight month, a reassuring sign within the domestic economy even as deathly viral outbreak threatens future growth. \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government is also working to reassure the country that the governments has tools to shield the economy from the global outbreak. \n Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies in its next budget, due in coming weeks. He said he has been in regular contact with the CEOs of major banks and telcos to discuss the virus impact. Trudeau promised that his government will protect Canada\u2019s economy from a possible slowdown. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Noah Zivitz", "title": "TSX falls more than 10% from peak as 'panic' hits Bay Street", "description": "Canadian stocks slumped into correction territory Friday amid the global market downdraft triggered by fears about COVID-19.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tsx-falls-more-than-10-from-peak-as-panic-hits-bay-street-1.1401350", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 6, 2020", "content": "Canadian stocks slumped into correction territory Friday amid the global market downdraft triggered by fears about COVID-19. \n Shortly after 10 a.m. ET, the S&P/TSX composite index was down a little more than 10 per cent from its Feb. 20 peak. \n It\u2019s been a remarkable reversal on Bay Street after the TSX made a habit of smashing through records at the start of the year.

The second thing is for people who are investing, you usually already have a diverse portfolio so you won\u2019t be hit completely. \n When you are setting up your portfolio, \u00a0remember that things like this happen and prepare for them. I think you want to take advantage of the volatility these businesses are facing, so keep a shopping list. That way when there are these moments, you have that buy point already set so when they dip you can get into them. \n We set out our asset allocation ahead of time, but we haven\u2019t been putting money to the side. We have been deploying that in some of the names that we have been waiting to fall.\u201d \n David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist, Rosenberg Research \n \u201cI think that what you want to do is de-risk, get as defensive as possible. \n I think that taking a look at what\u2019s worked this week might be a short microcosm. If you are going to be in the equity market, you want to be in the essentials. You want to be in food products \u2013 you know\u00a0that\u2019s worked very well. There\u2019s been other areas that are very defensive, that have worked. I think the gold miners are to me almost a no-brainer\u00a0as to how you want to be positioned, but you want to be defensive in more of the consumers staples groups.\u201d \n Brian Madden, senior vice president and portfolio manager, Goodreid Investment Counsel \n \u201cTake it in stride. You need to understand that markets will pull back 10 per cent or more, on average, at least once a year. So in the moment, you are riveted to your screen and it can seem unsettling, but you need to step back and realize that this is normal. \n I think the strategy is the same as ever. Have an asset mix that makes sense for you, that\u2019s going to be a function of your own personality, tolerance for risk, age, experience as an investor, your income, and investment goals. That investment strategy is not something that should be blowing in the wind. So if someone has a sound investment strategy and asset mix, then they should be able to ride through tumultuous times \u2013 or even worse \u2013 without doing anything.\u201d \n Keith Richards, president and chief portfolio manager, ValueTrend Wealth Management \n \u201cWhen the market gets this bad, everyone says it\u2019s a buying opportunity. But if you don\u2019t have cash already, then what are you buying with? You need a trading program in place to take advantage of this, which is why buy-and-hold people suffer during these times. \n We are better-positioned since we can buy stuff really cheap right now. That means start to leg out of your defensive positions of cash and gold and move into your higher-volatility stocks that you wish you could have bought before.\u201d \n Matt Manara, partner and portfolio manager, Avenue Investment Management \n \u201cRight off the bat, do not get emotional about it. If you are working with a financial professional, hopefully they understand your life to balance you effectively between stocks and bonds. If you need regular income out of the portfolio, hopefully they have already accounted for it. \n If you are a Canadian investor, you have to be mindful of the U.S. dollar as it can have a big impact on your portfolio. Sell some of your U.S. assets so you have a buffer, and have some precious metals, which will help with inflation over the decade. \n You want to own things that have hard assets such as gold, silver, real estate, infrastructure, and companies where you own the existing assets. You want to have things that will typically perform better during a uptick in inflation.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "TSX plunges after trading halt as virus fears continue", "description": "Canadian stocks plunged, playing catchup to the rout in global markets after a technical glitch closed the main exchange two hours early in the midst of Thursday\u2019s meltdown.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tsx-plunges-after-trading-halt-as-virus-fears-continue-1.1397452", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 28, 2020", "content": "Canadian stocks plunged, playing catchup to the rout in global markets after a technical glitch closed the main exchange two hours early in the midst of Thursday\u2019s meltdown. \n The S&P/TSX Composite Index last traded at 16,200.33, down almost five per cent\u00a0from the closing price for Thursday listed on the TMX website.

His auto parts empire has 20,000 employees in China and Walker told us a handful of them contracted the illness. Watch for that full interview in The Open. Closer to home, one of the world\u2019s top mining conferences begins in Toronto on Sunday. Thousands of attendees and delegates from almost a hundred countries will be on hand. No doubt there are questions to be asked about what\u2019s being done to ensure maximum precautions are in place to guard everyone against the illness (even more so today when we look overseas at the decision to scrap this year\u2019s Geneva Auto Show). We\u2019re looking forward to speaking with the head of PDAC this morning on Commodities. \n WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR CANADIAN ECONOMY \n \"Probably the best we could have hoped for.\" That was TD Securities Chief Canada Strategist Andrew Kelvin's immediate reaction at 8:30 a.m.\u00a0ET after Statistics Canada released data showing Canada's economy grew 0.3 per cent\u00a0in December\u00a0and for the fourth quarter as a whole (in annualized terms). For Q4, much of the credit goes to Joe and Jane Canadian as household consumption rose two per cent; meanwhile, business spending on machinery and equipment sank 6.3 per cent in the final three months of the year. More pressingly, we\u2019ll consider how everything from the virus to blockades will weigh on growth for February and beyond and what that means for the Bank of Canada as it gears up for a rate decision next week. Can always count on David Rosenberg to call it like he sees it, and so if you missed it yesterday,  check out  why he\u2019s betting Canada, and the world, are heading for recession. \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -Alberta has  presented a budget  that narrows the deficit forecast for the fiscal year that\u2019s about to wrap up to $7.5 billion, while remaining on track for a surplus in 2022-23.

The S&P 500 index was down 137.63 points or 4.4 per cent at 2,978.76, while the Nasdaq composite was down 414.29 points or 4.6 per cent at 8,566.48. \n U.S. markets are as much as 12.9 per cent below the all-time high it set just a week ago. This is now their worst week since October 2008, when Wall Street was mired in the financial crisis. By contrast, the TSX is just seven per cent of last week's record high. \n Former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen reportedly suggested Thursday that the coronavirus could drag the U.S. economy into a recession. \n \"It's definitely something being widely contemplated now,\" said Crowther. \n He said it's been awhile since markets acted like this. \n \"If we look at the performance of equities since late 2018, the markets have been largely shrugging off any apparent risks to economic growth but if U.S.-China trade concerns and Brexit weren't enough to rattle investor sentiment, it appears that COVID-19 could be the tipping point.\" \n The Canadian dollar traded for 74.84 cents US, the lowest level in eight months, compared with an average of 75.15 cents US on Wednesday. \n All sectors on the TSX were down, led by health care, materials and energy. \n Health care dropped 3.6 per cent with The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. off 9.3 per cent, followed by several other cannabis producers. \n Materials was 3.2 per cent lower as Eldorado Gold lost 8.8 per cent on slightly lower gold prices. \n The April gold contract was down 60 cents at US$1,642.50 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 0.2 of a cent at US$2.57 a pound. \n The key energy sector was off 2.7 per cent with Frontera Energy Corp. and Husky Energy Inc. off 7.5 and 5.7 per cent, respectively, as crude oil prices sank to their lowest level since January 2019. \n The April crude contract was down US$1.64 at US$47.09 per barrel and the April natural gas contract was down 8.5 cents at US$1.75 per mmBTU. \n The recent severe market volatility coming so soon after reaching record highs is unusual and something newer investors may be experiencing for the first time amid a protracted bull run, said Crowther. \n \"The younger generation a lot of them didn't live through the global financial crisis so they're seeing some volatility that would remind us of some of the market dynamics that we would have seen in 2008 and 2009.\" \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Fear seen all over Canadian markets hit by virus, economy chill", "description": "Canada\u2019s stock market rally has cracked.

Volatility has spiked. And investors have been piling into government bonds, pushing yields to near-record lows. \n Anxiety is everywhere for investors in the nation\u2019s markets as the coronavirus outbreak and protests that hobbled rail traffic are magnifying concerns about an economic slowdown. \n The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost this year\u2019s gain in just four days of trading -- it is down 0.1 per cent in 2020. It had been up 5.2 per cent as of last Thursday\u2019s close. \n A technical indicator that measures buying strength versus selling strength -- known as the Bloomberg Fear and Greed indicator -- slumped to the lowest level since the global market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018. \n The coronavirus continued to spread across the world as new clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Ontario\u2019s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Wednesday a new positive case of the virus in Toronto, taking the number of infections in Canada to more than 10. \n Meanwhile, environmental and indigenous-rights activists have obstructed rail lines across Canada for weeks to protest the construction of TC Energy Corp.\u2019s CUS$6.6 billion (US$5 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. That has paralyzed parts of the nation\u2019s rail network in recent weeks, bringing grain movement to a near halt. \n Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday. \n Belski isn\u2019t so worried. \u201cWhile the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.\u201d Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added. \n Wild Ride \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Investing\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1395995 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1395995', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1908867, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 'Overdue correction': Stocks extend slide as virus fears weigh \n Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, says we're seeing an \u201coverdue correction\u201d in the markets as North American indices continue to fall on coronavirus fears.   \n \n Market turbulence has surged. At one point this week, volatility on the S&P/TSX soared to its highest level since Aug. 26. For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost four months as virus fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar\u2019s weakness. \n The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that \u201ccurrency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special \u2013- talking the currency down in order to do the bank\u2019s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.\u201d \n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a \u201clonger period of virus-related uncertainty,\u201d strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday. \n His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, \u201cdollar bloc\u201d currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year. \n In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That\u2019s another indicator of economic concern. \n An aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1.4 per cent year to date, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. on Wednesday, even as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak. \n For Baskin Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Barry Schwartz, long-term fundamentals are what count. \u201cMy advice to investors is the following.

But banks running the IPO only got support for the offering at about US$18 a share, according to people familiar with the matter then. \n Prior to that, it scrapped plans to raise money via an IPO in 2018 after getting backing from BC Partners and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan to recapitalize GFL instead. It had aimed to raised as much as $1 billion through a share sale, people familiar with the plan said in January 2018. \n Chief Executive Officer Patrick Dovigi founded GFL in 2007 and has made over 100 acquisitions since, the largest being the US$2.8 billion purchase of Waste Management Industries USA Inc. in 2018. The company has yet to turn a profit and has racked up debt to fuel those purchases -- $7.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n The IPO is being led by banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of Montreal, Goldman Sachs Group, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia. Other banks involved in the proposed offering include Barclays Plc, BC Partners, Raymond James Financial, Stifel Financial Corp., Toronot-Dominion Bank, Bank of America, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC Holdings Plc and National Bank of Canada. \n Shareholders include Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan, BC Partners and GIC Private, the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore. \n GFL has facilities across Canada and in 23 U.S. states, serving more than 4 million homes.

However, the global coronavirus situation is changing with Italy, South Korea and Iran all seeing sudden spikes in the number of people infected with the virus. \n That's ignited concerns that the economic hit in China will be repeated around the world if the virus spreads. \n \"If you had similar outbreaks in other countries or other continents those are the concerns that investors have -- what's the impact to production, to supply chains, to the travel and tourism industry -- lots of economic implications that investors are trying to assess,\" Chopra said in an interview. \n In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 fell Tuesday by more than three per cent for a second day in a row.

Today\u2019s market moves follow on last week\u2019s surge into havens after fresh warnings by companies over the potential impact of the virus on business and global supply chains. Adding to the anxiety Monday was China announcing an easing of the quarantine of\u00a0Wuhan, only to retract the statement hours later. \n \u201cMarkets hate uncertainty and the coronavirus represents the most uncertain macro risk markets have faced in years,\u201d said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FEST Russell. \u201cInvestors are also acutely aware that many misjudged the economic severity of the virus early on, making them more open to entertaining worst-case scenarios now.\u201d \n Elsewhere, Italian bonds dropped on concern that the spread of the coronavirus may push the economy into a recession.

Via Rail (whose CEO released a video statement late yesterday) is temporarily laying off approximately 1,000 employees as a result of the protests that are tied to the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia; and it was also forced to delay the resumption of service between Montreal and Quebec City because of a new blockade that popped up in the province. It\u2019s a complicated impasse with no end in sight. And Canada\u2019s premiers are now pressing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u00a0to speak with them today about options for resolving the situation. We\u2019re looking forward to speaking with Derek Burney this morning. As a former director of TransCanada it will be fascinating to hear what he has to say. \n TELUS RAISING UP TO $1.5 BILLION \n I can\u2019t remember the last time one of Canada\u2019s big telcos went to market like  Telus announced late yesterday . It\u2019s raising at least $1.3 billion in a bought deal financing of 25 million common shares priced at $52.00 apiece. With the over-allotment, the haul could swell to $1.5 billion. Proceeds are earmarked for capital expenditures, among other possibilities. Sidebar: Telus is presenting at the CRTC\u2019s hearing on the wireless industry today in Gatineau, Que.\u00a0\u2013 where capex has been a hot topic as it relates to the regulator\u2019s proposal to mandate access by upstart mobile virtual network operators to the incumbents\u2019 networks. \n ANOTHER TSX RECORD \n Investors are making a habit of sending Canadian stocks to all-time highs. New intraday and closing records were established yesterday as the S&P/TSX composite index closes in on another big round number of 18,000. Heavyweights likes CNRL, Enbridge and Shopify helped lead the way Wednesday. The bigger picture, as Paul Gardner from Avenue Investment Management pointed out this morning on The Street, is that investors\u2019 hunt for yield is benefiting some of the blue chip dividend names. \n MORGAN STANLEY BUYING E*TRADE \n M&A continues in the discount brokerage industry, with Morgan Stanley announcing today it\u2019s buying E*Trade for US$13 billion in an all-stock deal.

How quickly coronavirus fears fall by the wayside even as the number of deaths and confirmed cases continue to expand. Today it seems market sentiment is being supported by China\u2019s move to slash tariffs on US$75 billion worth of imports from America as part of the phase-one trade deal, as well as OPEC+ officials recommending the group scale back oil production. \n BLUE CHIP EARNINGS \n Quarterly reporting season is ramping up in Canada. This morning, BCE announced its dividend will rise five per cent after the company matched fourth-quarter profit expectations while touting \u201cpromotional spending discipline\u201d in its wireless division. Since we always point out BNN Bloomberg is owned by BCE through its Bell Media division, today we\u2019ll also note that unit saw its adjusted EBITDA jump 16.5 per cent\u00a0in the fourth-quarter. Meantime, BCE unveiled its financial forecasts for this year, including an adjusted EPS range that trails the average estimate. Over at Suncor, lots of talk about rewarding shareholders in its earnings release last night as the energy giant raises its quarterly dividend 11 per cent\u00a0and launches a new share buyback program. It was, however, a messy end to the year as Suncor booked more than $3 billion in impairment charges, resulting in a substantial net loss. \u00a0 \n TORONTO HOME PRICES KEEP HEATING UP \n It was more of the same in Canada\u2019s largest housing market last month: listings sank (-35 per cent), sales climbed (+15 per cent), prices rose (+12.3 per cent).
