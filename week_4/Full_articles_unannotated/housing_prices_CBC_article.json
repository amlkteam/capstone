A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.\nCharlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.\n\"It's getting ridiculous,\" Gallant says of the rental market. \"Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.\"\nCost of living is a big election issue, a\u00a0CBC\u00a0News-commissioned online\u00a0poll\u00a0from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.\nAs the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.\nThe Liberals\u00a0aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\nA central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people \"to\u00a0get ahead, not just get by,\" and that\u00a0the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have\u00a0promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply,\u00a0and said\u00a0Monday that if elected the party\u00a0would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the \"stress test\" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.\nIt is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.\nThe numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.\nData gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nIn Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.\nThis may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.\nCheck out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index\nAcross Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nAnd Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.\nWith housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.\n\"We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,\" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. \"We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.\"\nEach community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.\u00a0\nAnother is house prices \u2014\u00a0Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.\nAdded to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.\n\"And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,\" Brown explains.\nHolland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school\u00a0after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.\n\"Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,\" says Elkerton. \"The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.\"\nShe's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found \"many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze \u2014\u00a0hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.\"\nCanadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing \u2014\u00a0whether renting or owning.\u00a0\nAmong the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.\nCharlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford \u2014\u00a0and those who can't find anything at all.\n\"We may be a small city,\" he says,\u00a0\"but we've got big city problems.\"\nThe mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.\n\"I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,\" Brown says. \"From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.\"\nWatch The National's story about what it's like to live in a 'severely unaffordable' Canadian city:\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Toronto area housing sales up 24.3% in July, prices rise due to tighter supply", "description": "Overall average selling price for properties in GTA was $806,755", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-home-sales-1.5237143", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5237166.1565368546!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/luxury-home-report-20181023.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 06, 2019 9:25 AM ET", "2019-08-09T16:36:32.577Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Greater Toronto Area's home price index was up 4.4 per cent last month as the supply of properties for sale tightened and the number of sales jumped 24.3 per cent from July last year, the Toronto Real Estate Board reports.\nThe overall average selling price for properties in the Greater Toronto Area was up 3.2 per cent year-over-year to $806,755, TREB said in a monthly report issued Tuesday.\nThe number of properties sold increased to 8,595 from 6,916, with sales of all four categories of housing up by double digits.\n\"Broadly speaking, increased competition between buyers for available properties has resulted in relatively strong price growth above the rate of inflation for semi-detached houses, townhouses and condominium apartments,\" Jason Mercer, the real estate board's chief market analyst, said in a statement.\nOn the other hand, he said, sales of fully detached homes have been more affected by a stress test required for federally regulated mortgages and the average price for that category of housing was down 0.9 per cent overall.\nIn the City of Toronto itself, the average price for fully detached homes fell 9.1 per cent to $1.23 million, offsetting a 2.5 per cent increase in the surrounding 905 area to an average of $929,633.\nTREB says that the supply of properties for sale in the Greater Toronto Area was also tighter than it was last year.\nThere were 14,393 new listings in the GTA during the month, up from 13,873 in July 2018, but the total number of active listings at the end of July was down 9.1 per cent from a year ago.\nTREB CEO John DiMichele said there's a growing demand for residential properties due to population growth.\n\"As more and more households come to terms with the stress test and move back into the market in the coming months and years, they could suffer from a chronically under-supplied marketplace and an acceleration of home price growth to unsustainable levels,\" DiMichele predicted.\n\"Fortunately, policy makers have acknowledged the housing supply issue and are working toward solutions.\"\nThe board said it welcomes a move by Toronto Mayor John Tory and the city council, which instructed staff to report on ways to increase housing options in neighbourhoods that traditionally have had single-family dwellings.\nTREB also said it supports provincial government consultations to \"spur on and speed up\" the development of different forms of housing.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Meghan McCabe", "title": "St. John's housing prices will lead country in growth, according to Moody's", "description": "Economist says below-trend prices, drop in unemployment rate leading to predicted increase", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/st-johns-housing-prices-going-up-moodys-1.5149461", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5146804.1558629790!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-regina-sask-housing-market-home-house-remax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 25, 2019 6:00 PM NT", "2019-05-26T11:26:15.806Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For homeowners in St. John's\u00a0it may seem like a long time coming, but Moody's Analytics is projecting housing prices to increase\u00a0by more than six per cent over the next few years\u00a0and lead the country in growth.\u00a0\nThere are two main reasons for the projected rise: how low house prices are, and the improving unemployment rate, said director and head housing economist\u00a0Andres Carbacho-Burgos.\u00a0\nThe first is where house prices sit, compared with the $340,000 mark for single family homes in late 2015.\u00a0\n\"Now they're at less than $300,000.

It then slows\u00a0down again through the rest of the year before beginning\u00a0the cycle again.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown those trends out the window, as lockdowns and physical distancing measures have put a chill on home buying right as the market normally tends to heat up.\n\"Like so many other parts of normal daily life, a lot of buying and selling activity in housing markets across Canada has been put on pause,\" the CREA's chief economist Shaun Cathcart said.\nThe CREA said it saw the trend begin in March, which started out strong before sales plunged in the latter half of the month. All in all, March\u00a0sales were down by 15 per cent from February's level. Now, April is almost 60 per cent below that record low.\n\"The housing market has, in unprecedented fashion, effectively shut down and closed for business,\" Bank of Montreal economist Robert Kavcic said of the numbers.\nThe number of homes sold is in free fall, but so far average prices are not plummeting as sellers try to ride out the pandemic.\nThe average price of a home sold by a realtor last month was\u00a0$488,000, down by 1.3 per cent from\u00a0April 2019.\nWhile prices seem to be flat, on average, compared to last year, there are signs that they aren't immune to\u00a0negative pressure.\u00a0April's average price was 10 per cent lower than March's, an almost unprecedented development\u00a0given the seasonal nature of Canadian real estate.\nWhile house prices are undeniably under pressure, Toronto-Dominion Bank\u00a0economist\u00a0Brian DePratto says April's numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\"Weaker activity at the higher end of the market\u00a0took on an even bigger role in shaping average prices given the unprecedented\u00a0low level of transactions,\" he said.\nSales of high-end homes were down in Toronto and Vancouver, the two priciest markets in the country. Without those big sales prices acting as a magnet pulling up the average, the average price figure will look even more wonky than it normally does, according to DePratto.\n\"With activity shrinking so dramatically and likely to stay depressed for several months, average prices will likely be distorted,\" he said.\nCREA acknowledges that its average selling price can be misleading, which is why for several years the group has been tabulating another figure, the House Price Index or HPI, which it says is a better gauge of the market because it strips out distortions such as \"changes in the mix of sales activity from one month to the next.\"\nThe HPI\u00a0inched down by 0.6 per cent in April, the first monthly decline in almost a year. \"While some downward pressure on prices is to be expected, the comparatively small change underscores the extent to which the bigger picture is one where so much activity on both the selling and buying side is currently on pause,\" the CREA said.\nIt's not hard to see why average selling prices could be misleading.\nNormally, a homeowner living in a home they think is worth $1 million\u00a0would list their home and see what offers come in. If the offers they receive aren't to\u00a0their liking \u2014 say, $800,000 in our example \u2014\u00a0they likely just won't sell unless they have to, so that lower-than-expected house valuation doesn't get recorded in the official\u00a0numbers anywhere.\nIt stands to reason that the only homeowners selling right now are either happy with the offers they're getting, or they are selling for less than they'd hoped, or even at a loss, because\u00a0they are being forced to\u00a0due to job loss or other COVID-related factors.\nFor BMO's Kavcic, there won't be a true picture of what's happening in home prices until\u00a0buying and selling real estate can get back to what he calls \"some semblance of normalcy.\"\n\"It's going to be a race between sales and listings out of the gate to determine how the market balance shapes up, and where prices move in the near term,\" Kavcic said.\nUnprecedented government\u00a0income support measures such as CEWS and CERB will likely help limit panicky forced selling at depressed prices by owners who've lost their jobs and income. But they can't stop all the downward pressure, and certainly not forever.\n\"It's probably a big stretch to assume that the market will just go back to where it was pre-pandemic,\" Kavcic\u00a0said. \"Job market weakness will linger in certain sectors, and there could be investor-owned supply waiting to come to the market at first chance.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1737914435690", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Time to buy?

Bidding wars are still occurring and it remains a sellers' market for condos under $700,000 and detached homes around $1.6 million, whereas the market for more expensive homes tends\u00a0to favour buyers. \u00a0\nSo far, there hasn't been a lot of panic or forced selling, but I believe that could change in the fall.\nWhen trying to forecast where the market is heading, there are two variables that I will be closely monitoring \u2014 the post COVID-19 employment numbers and the expansion or\u00a0introduction of new government programs created to combat the financial effects of the pandemic.\u00a0\nA low unemployment rate does wonders for real estate valuations as it is an indicator that the economy is functioning well. Strong economies attract new investments, businesses, immigrants, temporary workers, international students, refugees \u2014 all of which increases demand for housing\u00a0and results in higher rents and house prices.\u00a0\nA weak economy does the opposite. People will not move here unless they think they can find a job, while recently laid off workers with few ties to Vancouver may leave. In other words, we see less demand and more supply.\nAccording to Moody's analytics, for every one\u00a0per cent increase in unemployment, house prices typically drop about 4 per cent. Based on this ratio, if our unemployment rate were to double from pre-COVID-19 levels, home values would drop by roughly 20 per cent.\nThe main reason house prices are not currently dropping is due to government intervention.\u00a0The various levels of government\u00a0stepped in with a series of temporary programs to replace or subsidize the income of those affected by COVID-19. They also arranged for many of our expenses to be deferred \u2014 such as utility bills, taxes and mortgage payments. All these programs have bought struggling homeowners some time, and have taken the pressure off to sell their homes.\u00a0\nBut what happens when the safety nets disappear? That is when the ill-prepared or vulnerable homeowners will be forced to sell. \u00a0Many of the government programs are expected to wind down in the summer and\u00a0fall, and we may see a spike in new listings \u2014 a great time for buyers but terrible for sellers.\nIf I had plans to sell my home sometime in\u00a02020 or early 2021, I would be listing my home sooner rather than later. While I'm not expecting a 20 per cent drop in value over the short term, it also wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.\u00a0I also wouldn't be surprised if the government bailed out the housing market and valuations returned to all time highs. The B.C. government's tax base is heavily reliant on the construction and housing industries,\u00a0so they can't afford to have housing valuations drop too low. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile I'm very cautious on real estate over the short term, I still think it's a solid long-term investment.\nMy advice to prospective buyers, if valuations drop by 15 to 30 per cent in 2020 or early 2021, consider leaving the sidelines as it could be the buying opportunity that many of you have been waiting for.\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at\u00a0impact@cbc.ca\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U of Regina selling 'mansion' that presidents lived in, rent-free", "description": "Former student union president says news is being met with support and shock", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/university-regina-selling-home-1.5572641", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5572752.1589581956!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/former-university-of-regina-president-house.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["May 15, 2020 5:11 PM CT", "2020-05-15T23:11:48.842Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The University of Regina is preparing to sell a home it has owned since 1991, in order to free up some cash during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe house at 1001 McNiven Ave. had served as a home for the president of the U of R to live in, rent-free.\nThe\u00a0nearly 4,000-square-foot home, with five bedrooms and five bathrooms,\u00a0also had a $100,000 maintenance budget, paid for by the university.\u00a0Estimated taxes on the property for 2020 are\u00a0$8,525.08, according to the City of Regina's website.\n\"We have no interest in buying a new replacement house and that wouldn't be part of the package on offer for an incoming president,\" said Dave Button, vice-president of administration for the university.\nThe home had served as an incentive for incoming presidents at a time when the housing market lacked the choice it does now.\nIt wasn't a free-ride for the president, though, Button said.\u00a0It was assessed by the Canada Revenue Agency as a taxable benefit, in excess of $30,000 per year, he said.\u00a0\nHe says there had been plans to sell the home prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"It just makes good economic sense, and it makes sense for for the future president to \u2026 have their own choice.\"\nThere is an opportunity now to sell the home, since it is vacant.

To address all of those challenges, the Liberals announced $1.7 billion in funding for wells in April as part of a\u00a0relief package\u00a0that also included new assistance to help firms reduce carbon\u00a0emissions.\nEnvironmentalists seemed to approve. So did\u00a0Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. But demands for more help\u00a0persisted.\nWhen the Trudeau government announced this week a program to provide loans to large and medium-sized employers (including oil and gas producers),\u00a0it said that any borrowing would come with conditions \u2014 including a requirement to \"publish annual climate-related disclosure reports \u2026 including how their future operations will support environmental sustainability and national climate goals.\"\nProponents of climate disclosure \u2014\u00a0among them Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 have called on firms to publicly account for how their business will be affected in future by both government policies to reduce emissions and the actual impacts of climate change. In theory, such disclosures would push investors to push\u00a0companies\u00a0to make environmentally sound decisions.\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board, an international body established by the G20, launched a task force on climate disclosure\u00a0chaired by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. That task force came back with\u00a0recommendations in 2017. Last June, the Liberal government's own expert panel on \"sustainable finance\" \u2014\u00a0chaired by Tiff Macklem, recently appointed governor of the Bank of Canada \u2014 advised the government to \"define and pursue a Canadian approach to implementing\" those recommendations.\nMany companies already provide\u00a0some level of climate disclosure \u2014 a study by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada in 2019 found that 98 per cent of firms included some degree of disclosure\u00a0in their financial filings. But just one company in the CPA survey was meeting the task force's proposed standards.\nThis week's announcement might help kick-start that change.\nAttaching such a condition no doubt also\u00a0makes it easier politically\u00a0to sell the pandemic loans policy to voters leery of using public funds to support large corporations, particularly oil and gas producers.\nBut the Liberals are promising to apply other conditions related to things like executive pay, collective bargaining agreements\u00a0and dividends. Such things might\u00a0seem like simple due diligence when dispersing public funds, but climate change also now seems to qualify\u00a0as a fundamental consideration.\nThe Liberals should\u00a0consider taking advantage of other opportunities to push for change, said Stewart Elgie, founder and chair of the Smart Prosperity Institute.\n\"Climate disclosure is one good way of accelerating the shift to a climate-smart economy,\" he said. \"They should also be looking for ways to tie economic relief to improved environmental performance.\"\nAs an example, Elgie cites the bailout of the North American automotive industry in 2009, which President Barack Obama's administration in the United States used to push for higher fuel efficiency standards.\nThe result was an industry that is arguably both more competitive and more environmentally friendly.\nAs the extent of the economic damage caused by COVID-19 has become clear, there have been calls to pursue a \"green recovery\" \u2014 for governments to focus their rebuilding efforts and economic stimulus on combating climate change. That remains the single largest opportunity here for driving some much-needed changes.\nBut it's also not clear yet\u00a0when governments will be able to start pursuing recovery plans. Canada is still in the emergency phase, and individuals and businesses need aid to get through the current crisis.\nEven in the short-term, though, there will be chances to to deal with the climate threat \u2014 which will still be with us once the pandemic has passed.\nIn a recent white paper, policy analysts and consultants Ralph Torrie and Celine Bak proposed a $2 billion fund to help cities establish \"permanent corridors \u2026 for people walking and cycling to work and school, while maintaining physical distancing.\" In the midst of a pandemic, such routes would give some people safer ways\u00a0to get\u00a0around. In the long term, maintaining those corridors would promote environmentally friendly transit.\nBrendan Haley, policy director at Efficiency Canada, has suggested that efforts to increase\u00a0the energy efficiency of homes and business can still be pursued during a time of physical distancing \u2014 such as\u00a0online training for \"green building skills\" and virtual energy assessments.\nHaley also emphasizes the need to plan now so that governments and businesses can be ready to move when it's time to start implementing a recovery plan. Elgie\u00a0also notes that updated building codes \u2014\u00a0currently being developed by the National Research Council \u2014 could help frame future stimulus spending on housing.\nThe Liberals also promised last fall to develop climate change accountability legislation that would set legally binding targets and establish third-party oversight \u2014 a promise that shouldn't necessarily be sidelined by a pandemic.\nThough COVID-19 clearly has\u00a0become a historic crisis, the Liberals are still faced with a political and moral imperative to deal with climate change. Justin Trudeau's government might be defined by how it handles this virus and its effects, but it's unlikely to be excused, either by\u00a0its supporters or by historians, if the threat to the planet\u00a0is forgotten in the process.\nSetting aside budget plans might have been necessary. But 2050 \u2014 the year when Canada is supposed to reach net-zero emissions \u2014 isn't getting any further away.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "How should Ottawa grow?

Those involved in the development industry\u00a0argued that not increasing the supply of land for home building\u00a0would drive house prices sky high, putting them\u00a0further\u00a0out of reach for young people and new Canadians.\nLand prices have tripled since the city decided to hold the urban boundary back in 2010,\u00a0said Kevin Murphy of Mattamy Homes.\n\"You're right on the cusp of unaffordable housing,\" added Andrew Brethour, a realtor who advises\u00a0builders.\nBut other costs matter beyond the price of a house, such as\u00a0transportation or proximity to social services, argued community organizations.\u00a0\nDr. Eugenie Waters, for instance, said she has patients who are seniors who travel from the suburbs to her clinic.\n\"I really worry about us falling into this trap that it's more affordable for people to move out to the ... new suburbs, and there won't be the social services out there.\"\u00a0\nMany presenters also wanted the city to show\u00a0far\u00a0more details about how much each of the three scenarios set out\u00a0would cost the city in infrastructure, and the implications for its climate change goals.\nIn order to absorb tens of thousands more people in existing neighbourhoods, staff recommend building a lot more shorter, multi-unit complexes instead of relying solely on controversial high-rises. These lower-rise buildings could be made of wood instead of concrete, which is more expensive.\nArchitect Rosaline Hill agreed with the city planning staff's vision. She argued that the entire city should be intensified in this manner, with the first\u00a0focus on areas that are the easiest to make\u00a0walkable, such as those near transit.\nThat may mean many established communities, or what Coun. Jeff Leiper called the \"bungalow belt\" neighbourhoods within the Greenbelt, could see change soon.\nBut Josh Kardish of EQ Homes said while those older areas were \"ripe\" for mid-rise and infill, he questionned whether the city could build enough housing for an additional 400,000 people without apartment towers.\nThe meeting opened Monday with a motion by Coun. Eli El-Chantiry to protect prime farmland to disqualify\u00a0any properties on the city's\u00a0formal \"agricultural resource areas\" list to be included in the urban boundary.\nMembers of Just Food say that still leave open the possibility for development on\u00a0some farms, like those outside the officially designated areas or land with poorer soils where animals graze.\nThe group\u00a0called on councillors to tweak the motion further so that it captures all land used for agriculture, so that no more farmland becomes housing.\nEven staff's projection methods for how it calculated\u00a0the how much additional\u00a0lands will be needed\u00a0came under fire.\nIt turns out, city staff used a different\u00a0definition for how much intensification this city is achieving. Recently, the City of Ottawa was hitting 50 per cent intensification, far exceeding the 40 per cent goal in its official plan.\u00a0\nBut for this boundary discussion\u00a0staff said it makes more sense not to count collective housing for seniors or students. The \"goalposts had moved,\" as the Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association tried to explain it. That dropped Ottawa's\u00a0current intensification rate to just 38 per cent.\nMichael Wolfson, former assistant chief statistician at Statistics Canada now with the University of Ottawa, said he was \"baffled\" the city would omit retirement homes.\u00a0\nCity staff also said in its\u00a0report it\u00a0had no real data on the resale housing market, so the number of households they expect Ottawa to need might be high. Wolfson said that data exists and is \"critical\".\u00a0\n\"I'm afraid that the information provided to you by staff \u2026 is seriously inadequate for you, and for\u00a0citizens like myself,\" said Wolfson.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Following Fort McMurray flood, mayor calls for additional financial aid", "description": "Damages to residences alone could top $100 million, Don Scott says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/flooding-fort-mcmurray-insurance-financial-aid-1.5554403", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5548946.1588609852!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mcmurray-aviation-flooding.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 04, 2020 9:41 AM MT", "2020-05-04T20:12:40.324Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Without long-term financial assistance, many people in Fort McMurray whose homes and businesses were devastated by spring flooding will face financial ruin, says the region's mayor.\n\"In the big picture, we are going to need massive help.

This is a massive disaster,\" said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo.\nHe said\u00a0most evacuees don't\u00a0have adequate property insurance to cover the damages.\nScott is calling on the federal and provincial governments to extend disaster relief funding to the nearly 13,000 people forced from their homes last week.\n\"Very few people have coverage,\" he said in an interview Sunday with CBC News.\n\"The average coverage that I saw, and very few people had it, was $10,000. And I would say, the average person, the damage I saw \u2014 it varied from place to place \u2014 was over $120,000, so this could put people in financial ruin.\"\nScott said emergency cash for evacuees, announced last week by the Alberta government, will only provide temporary relief. The payments \u2014 $1,250 for adults and $500 for children \u2014 will cost the province $11.7 million for one week, Premier Jason Kenney said Wednesday.\nScott said many homeowners and businesses will struggle to rebuild if they don't get additional help.\nKenney has said that the Fort McMurray flood should qualify for the province's Disaster Recovery Program.\nUnder that program, the government would provide some financial support for recovery costs for critical public infrastructure and non-insured private infrastructure.\nThe area is now in \"the recovery phase,\" Scott Davis, director of Emergency Management for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, said Monday.\nPower has been turned back on for some 4,000 homes in the area, Davis said.\nA boil-water advisory is still in place for all neighbourhoods in Fort McMurray, Anzac, Draper, Gregoire Lake Estates and Saprae Creek Estates.\nAlberta Health Services (AHS) will not remove the advisory until all of the 375-kilometre potable water distribution system has been flushed, disinfected and tested, according to a release from the regional municipality. The advisory will be lifted incrementally, as each phase of the work is completed and then approved by AHS and Alberta Environment and Parks.\nThat work, which will be done in five phases,\u00a0is expected to start Friday and finish in early September, the release said.\nFort McMurray has been hit hard by natural and economic disasters in recent years.\nMany residents are still dealing\u00a0with the aftermath of the 2016 wildfire, the\u00a0costliest disaster for insurers in Canadian history.\u00a0In all, about 2,400 homes and buildings burned in the fire and many homeowners lacked the proper insurance,\u00a0slowing rebuild efforts.\nMeanwhile, people in the northern Alberta community are reeling from job losses related to the pandemic and a gutting drop in oil prices.\nPeople who have lost everything for a second time may\u00a0decide to leave the community altogether, Scott said.\nThe flooding began April 26, when a 25-kilometre sheet of ice effectively dammed the Athabasca River, forcing the Clearwater River to reverse course and flood the city's downtown core. An estimated 1,230 structures were damaged.\u00a0\nThe last evacuation orders were lifted late Saturday but it may be weeks before people can truly return home.\u00a0\nMany homes swamped by flooding remain uninhabitable. Basements remain waterlogged and caked with mud. There are concerns about asbestos and mould.\nWith many homes unsafe to live in, the municipality announced on the weekend that emergency housing provided through the Red Cross was being extended until May 10.\u00a0\nRed Cross is also providing flood cleanup kits to residents, Davis said Monday.\nBrad McCoy, president of Norfort Gymnastics Association, said the gym, which overlooks the Clearwater River, was flooded with more than five feet of water.\nThe waters have receded but the gym remains caked with a thick layer of river mud.\u00a0\n\"It looked like a mud bomb when off in there,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's probably a lot worse than we thought.\"\nMcCoy doubts the non-profit agency's insurance policy will cover the damages.\n\"We don't know if we have insurance. In fact, we're pretty sure we don't,\" he said. \"Hopefully we can get some support from the city and the provincial government but right now we're just trying to clean up and salvage what we can.\n\"Are we going to make it through? Absolutely ... But at the end of the day, it's going to be close.\"\u00a0\nScott said he has been in talks with provincial and federal officials and remains optimistic that additional relief is coming for evacuees.\nEven with long-term financial aid, he expects it will take several months for the community to recover.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately, the difficulty is, people are really back in only to assess the damage,\" Scott said.\u00a0\n\"The recovery period is going to be very long and very difficult.\"\n"}, {"author": "Darren Bernhardt", "title": "M\u00e9tis raise flag above newly purchased Bank of Montreal building at Portage and Main", "description": "'It's like retracing and actually capturing a lot of our history': Manitoba Metis Federation president", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/m%c3%a9tis-portage-main-bank-montreal-heritage-1.5565955", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5566303.1589313638!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bank-of-montreal-building-in-winnipeg-new-manitoba-metis-federat.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 12, 2020 3:10 PM CT", "2020-05-12T21:15:27.181Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Manitobans celebrate the 150th anniversary of the province, descendants of the\u00a0M\u00e9tis\u00a0who paved the way for its creation are celebrating a renewed and prominent presence.\nThe\u00a0Manitoba Metis Federation flag was raised high above\u00a0the Bank of Montreal building at Portage Avenue and Main Street on Tuesday after the organization announced late Monday that it was buying the historic downtown Winnipeg landmark, which will become home to the M\u00e9tis Nation Heritage Centre.\u00a0\nWATCH | Historic day for the MMF\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b:\n\"[We're] sending a message loud and clear that the M\u00e9tis played a very important role in this province and we still do, even after 150 years of sometimes turmoil with this country and sometimes with this province.

It's like retracing and actually capturing a lot of our history, of our sadness, where our land was taken from us. Now we're taking something with such solid position in history back.\"\u00a0\nManitoba became the fifth Canadian province on May\u00a012,\u00a01870, when the Manitoba Act received royal assent. It was officially\u00a0enacted on July\u00a015,\u00a01870.\nThe act was based on a list of rights\u00a0drafted\u00a0by Louis Riel and his M\u00e9tis provisional government and presented to the federal government as conditions for the province to enter Confederation.\n\"[It was] led by the only Indigenous peoples in Canada to ever negotiate a province into\u00a0Confederation,\" Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal, built in 1913, stands just a 15-minute walk from where Fort Garry once stood, jutting out over what's now\u00a0Main Street at Assiniboine Avenue.\nAt the end of 1869, Riel and others took control of the fort and took over the administration of the Red River area until an agreement was reached with Ottawa.\n\"So there's no doubt in our mind \u2026 the footprints of our ancestors walked through this area,\" Chartrand said.\nHe's been inundated with texts,\u00a0calls and emails from people in the M\u00e9tis\u00a0community, he said.\n\"Over and over it's about just how proud our people are that this is happening.\u00a0Everybody knows the historic significance of that location, right by the Red River. Of course we were called, at one time, the Red River M\u00e9tis.\"\nAs part of the Manitoba Act, the federal government promised to set aside 5,565 square kilometres of land along the Red and Assiniboine\u00a0rivers\u00a0\u2014 which meet at The Forks near Portage and Main\u00a0\u2014 for 7,000 children of the Red River M\u00e9tis. However,\u00a0the government failed to follow through and most\u00a0of that land was never provided.\nIncreasing numbers of settlers and\u00a0land fraud\u00a0due to uncontrolled speculation\u00a0forced many M\u00e9tis to leave, in hopes of making a\u00a0living elsewhere.\nIn 1981, the MMF began a land claim case against the federal government for the\u00a01.4 million acres it was promised.\nIn 2018, the federation\u00a0was finally\u00a0awarded $154 million in compensation.\n\"I think it's going to lift a lot of eyebrows up: 'What's going on here? The M\u00e9tis, where are they coming from? All of a sudden they're coming and buying some historic, some really landmark locations?'\" Chartrand said about the purchases the MMF is now making.\nThe Bank of Montreal\u00a0\"is just one,\" he said. An announcement could be coming next week for another location in the downtown area and \"it's bigger than Portage and Main,\" he said.\n\"As they say in the movies, we're baaa-aack.\"\nWhen Chartrand became MMF president in\u00a01997, he stood at the corner of Portage and Main, waving the\u00a0M\u00e9tis\u00a0Nation flag.\n\"I remember saying 'One day, this will be ours,'\" he said. \"And I've made statements in the past that if we've got to buy our land back one acre at\u00a0a time, we'll do that.\"\nThe MMF has been in\u00a0negotiations with\u00a0BMO Financial Group for some time and it was difficult to keep it quiet, Chartrand said.\nThe Bank of Montreal announced plans last fall that it would be moving across the street into the office tower at 201 Portage Ave.\u00a0\nChartrand wouldn't reveal the purchase price, saying only that both sides reached a number they appreciated.\n\"Eventually that number will come out. I have to report it to my people,\" he said.\nOnce the transfer of the building is complete, the MMF will shift its business activities into it and begin to create the\u00a0heritage centre, which\u00a0will contain artifacts and stories about the M\u00e9tis\u00a0in Canada.\nChartrand is aiming for August as a grand opening for the business side of things, as long as restrictions due to COVID-19 will allow it. He didn't have a date\u00a0when the heritage centre will be ready.\nChartrand said more news is coming at the end of the week, when the MMF will announce a massive hiring program that will include 500 summer students across the province.\nAnother 200 people who are skilled in construction and carpentry will be hired to do housing repairs and new builds, he said, adding the federation is also expanding its communications department.\n\"We already set the stage for the investment of how much money will be set aside for these jobs. It will be announced on Friday,\" Chartrand said.\nWATCH | Ray St. Germain performs 'I'm Mighty Proud I'm Metis':\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Ottawa has 80,000 more suburban houses in its future.

As her family grew over the years, they moved from one new development to another, seeking new home features and upgrading their garage. It was a \"bad habit,\"\u00a0she now says.\nHomes on the fringes of the city are as popular as ever. People line up when a builder releases a new block of housing\u00a0to lay money on a unit.\nBut city planners and politicians alike know\u00a0that growth comes at a cost\u00a0\u2014 pipes, transit, greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0\u2014 and have talked for years about growing in a more compact way, and\u00a0packing more homes into existing areas to limit those downsides.\u00a0\nYet, in a big report to be debated at a virtual city committee meeting May 11, city staff say what's realistic is to expand the urban boundary to allow\u00a0an extra\u00a023,300 homes at the fringes of the suburbs by 2046. That's\u00a0on top of the\u00a066,300 units already in the pipeline.\nSome 88 per cent of those yet-to-be-built units\u00a0would be houses that fit one family, with their own\u00a0front door. The rest would be apartment units.\nCoun. Jeff Leiper was shocked city staff would recommend adding so much land \u2014\u00a0the 1,281 hectares designated for new urban areas is bigger than his entire ward of Kitchissippi.\nHe's also disappointed by the\u00a0calculations staff have done, saying it appears they've based the need\u00a0for future land\u00a0on the housing trends of the past. Leiper wants the urban-rural divide to stay where it is.\n\"If we're going to be sustainable, if we are going to have 15-minute neighbourhoods, if we're going to have affordable public transit, if we're going to keep our taxes as low as possible, then we can't just give in to market demand for single-family homes,\" Leiper said. His ward in the core is the epicentre for new highrise towers and pricey infill developments.\nBut Ottawa's mayor agrees with city staff, who say holding the urban boundary\u00a0is too ambitious.\u00a0\n\"[That's] easier said than done. You've seen some real battles over the years. Everyone talks a good line about intensification, but when it's in their community\u00a0they're against it. There are dozens of examples,\"\u00a0Jim Watson said.\nWatson calls the scenario staff prefer a \"balanced approach.\" Ottawa's population is projected to rise by 400,000\u00a0to 1.4 million people by 2046, and the city\u00a0sees splitting the projected 195,000 more households it would\u00a0need almost evenly between\u00a0existing built-up areas\u00a0and undeveloped parcels.\u00a0\nThe city\u00a0can't risk supplying insufficient space\u00a0for the expected homes. The Ontario government requires Ottawa\u00a0show it has enough.\nThat's not to say the scenario\u00a0staff propose doesn't call for much more intensification than happens now. It does. By 2046, 42,700 more apartments, as well as 49,400 single-detached, semi-detached\u00a0and row homes could elbow into\u00a0existing Ottawa neighbourhoods\nStaff have even worked with a local architectural firm on\u00a0a new kind of structure that\u00a0might help meet the needs of\u00a0Ottawa families\u00a0while building a city that's more dense:\u00a0the \"613 flat.\"\nThat is, six-rooms and\u00a0three bedrooms per unit in short buildings that blend in with\u00a0their neighbours. It offers the elusive \"missing middle\" style of housing \u2014 neither a house, nor a highrise apartment.\nThe problem, staff write, is\u00a0it takes time to create policies, and more time yet to get\u00a0the building industry and housing market to shift to building a new kind of lifestyle, and\u00a0at the right price people can afford.\nA planner who studies how cities grow and change says a big reason families\u00a0especially\u00a0keep flocking to the suburbs is that North American cities have\u00a0not been very successful at delivering them exactly these kinds of options.\n\"Most of our cities have done either really high density in the centre, or quite low density in the form of single-detached dwellings,\" said Markus Moos, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo's school of planning. \"So if you're looking for green space immediately outside your home, single-detached dwellings are often the only affordable alternative.\"\nOn the one hand, governments\u00a0have to be sure they give neighbourhoods\u00a0the good transit, amenities and green space they need, Moos said. Ideally, before a new development\u00a0is built, so as not to lock in car-centric habits.\nBeyond that, Moos said\u00a0better ideas are needed to make sure people consider the full cost of where they choose to live.\nHe points to the idea of \"location-efficient mortgages\"\u00a0\u2014 financing incentives for homebuyers who are less reliant on their cars.\nAnd then there's mindset.\u00a0\n\"I would like to call for a cultural shift. We don't need to have a backyard in order to raise our kids. We don't have to live in a house,\" said\u00a0Naama Blonder, an architect with Smart Density in Toronto\nBlonder contributed to that city's policy for how to make highrise towers more family-friendly. Many newcomers to Canada come from countries where dense living is the norm, she noted. Buildings here just need to have families in mind: units with enough bedroom space and room for a stroller, as well as\u00a0common areas for teens to do homework.\nAnd, Blonder added, when battles about new highrise proposals happen, focus less on how tall a building could be, and more on pushing for a great street-level vibe and pathways that connect people to transit and parks.\nIn the meantime, families continue to\u00a0choose Ottawa's far-flung suburbs because they're affordable. They also like the newness, lack of maintenance\u00a0and, sometimes, having space for multiple generations to live under one roof,\u00a0said Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board.\nBut subdivisions themselves are changing slowly, and many look\u00a0nothing like the\u00a0big lots on winding crescents of old.\u00a0New\u00a0suburbs are more compact. When the city issued a record number of building permits in 2018, more were for semis and stacked townhomes\u00a0than for single-detached models. Some apartment buildings are going up.\n\"Toodle around and you won't believe\u00a0what's out there now,\" Burgoyne said.\nAs for Lecours, she still loves her community in Orl\u00e9ans, she just wishes there were more small coffee shops and\u00a0community gardens, and more housing choices for renters\u00a0and downsizing seniors.\n\"If they plan properly, I think it is OK to expand,\" she said.\u00a0\"But it has to be done in a way where it serves the people.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sask. not seeing same COVID-19 impacts on housing market as rest of country", "description": "'We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year': realtor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/real-estate-market-regina-covid-19-1.5533914", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5013574.1579367230!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/digital-mortgages-20190210.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 5:00 AM CT", "2020-04-16T11:00:28.182Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The CEO of Royal Lepage says now is not the time to go out and shop for a new home \u2014 or sell.\nPhil Soper said 2020 was off to a \"boisterous\" start as more homes were selling in volume before a state of emergency was declared\u00a0in Saskatchewan four weeks ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"We believe that things will ease and people will be able to move into a very different buying and selling process,\" Soper told CBC Radio's\u00a0The Morning Edition.\n\"I'm not saying things will\u00a0return to normal in 2020, but the market will loosen up as people's\u00a0stay-at-home restrictions are lifted.\"\nSaskatchewan's housing market has not been negatively impacted to the extent of the rest of Canada about a month into the pandemic.\nHome sales fell 14.3 per cent in March nationally but the Canadian Real Estate Association says it is too early to determine the pandemic's effect on prices.\nSaskatchewan sales dipped 6.2 per cent on a year-over-year basis (March 2019 compared to March 2020) while prices dropped 5.1 per cent.\nThere were three more residential sales made between March 18\u00a0(421) than there were during the same time last year (418).\n\"We were seeing a lot of buyer confidence in the beginning of the year,\" said Brin Werrett, a realtor with Royal Lepage, of Regina's market.\n\"A lot of young buyers out pulling the trigger on houses, where last year, maybe they were a little bit hesitant.\"\nSales were down 6.2 per cent overall but the Saskatchewan Realtors Association says housing sales saw increases in several of the province's largest cities on a year-over-year basis.\nThere were 274 sales in Saskatoon last month, a six per cent increase.

It's set to become operational in 2021.\nThe centre handles 911 calls, calls from the public and handles dispatches for 54 detachments and districts.\nAccording to an RCMP internal report, the\u00a0RCMP added $1.6 million to Millbrook First Nation's proposal and put down zero rent for its preferred option \u2014 the\u00a0headquarters in Dartmouth.\n\"Millbrook First Nation\u00a0provided a proposal in good faith, but we now know that the competition was falsely stacked,\" wrote Chief Robert Gloade in a March 25 letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair requesting a re-do of the contract process.\n\"Obviously the first competition was tainted in favour of one outcome.\u00a0Millbrook First Nation is asking that this competition be repeated but performed by an objective assessment team with no predetermined outcome.\"\nCopies of the\u00a0letter were sent to Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller and Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett.\nBlair's\u00a0office referred questions to the RCMP, as did Bennett and Miller's spokespeople.\u00a0\nNova Scotia\u00a0RCMP\u00a0said the decision to relocate the communications centre to Dartmouth was the result of \"months of follow-up work\" that came to the best conclusion.\u00a0\n\"Our focus during the study and throughout the decision-making process was on the health and safety of our employees, operational requirements and fiscal responsibility,\" it said\u00a0in an emailed statement.\nThe RCMP reviewed six options before deciding on its headquarters, according to an internal 2017 report obtained under the Access to Information Act by former Liberal MP Bill Casey and provided to CBC News.\u00a0\nThose options included doing nothing, upgrading the existing Truro centre, moving to a new location in the city, building a new location in the city or moving the centre to Millbrook First Nation.\u00a0\nMillbrook's proposal was the second cheapest relocation option, behind the headquarters move. However, the RCMP report assigned an extra $1.6 million to every relocation except its headquarters option.\u00a0\nThe figure is based on how much the Mounties pay the federal Public Works department every year to maintain empty space in their headquarters that could be rented to other federal agencies.\u00a0\nThe RCMP also assigned zero rent to its headquarters option. Yet, according to Public Works records provided by Casey to CBC News, the cost of rental space in the building housing its headquarters is $547 per square metre\u00a0and total current annual rent is $10.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The process wasn't a fair process,\" said Gloade in an interview.\nMillbrook First Nation sits about five kilometres south of Truro in the geographic centre of the province. It proposed to place the emergency communications centre in the Millbrook First Nation Power Centre, which is on a high priority power grid that runs underground and also serves a hospital a kilometre away.\u00a0\nGloade said the advantages were many with his community's proposal. He said the existing employees at the Truro centre would not have to move to keep their jobs and there is lots of room for expansion in the commercial building.\nMillbrook already acts as the base for Nova Scotia Power whenever major natural events cause widespread power outages, Gloade said.\u00a0It also hosts an Onex Solutions Inc. data centre that holds data from the provincial education department and its cannabis operations, he said.\nCasey, who didn't run for re-election but raised the issue repeatedly while in Parliament, said the RCMP wanted the centre placed at its headquarters in Dartmouth and manipulated the competition to get their predetermined outcome.\n\"They cheated Millbrook First Nation out of a chance at this,\" said Casey.\nCasey said there were major problems with the RCMP's\u00a0selection process.\nThe RCMP's ranking chart for each of the six main options was based on seven categories using a three rating system \u2014 zero if it didn't meet standards, five if it met minimum standards and 10 if it met or surpassed standards, according to the 2017 report.\u00a0\nThe seven categories were: health and safety,\u00a0consolidation of resources, functionality of accommodations, financial impact, human resource sustainability, level of disruption and\u00a0potential for expansion.\nThe RCMP headquarters option rated 10s across the board.\nMillbrook's proposal rated a five on financial impact \u2014 primarily on the added $1.6 million, plus rent; a five on human resource sustainability, meaning the ability to staff the centre from the local population and a zero on ability to expand.\nIt scored an overall rating equal to the options of relocating to another building in Truro or constructing a new facility in the city \u2014 but at a cheaper overall price, according to the report.\u00a0\nCasey questioned why the First Nation proposal would rate so low on human resource sustainability since the centre in Truro has maintained its staffing for over a decade and all its employees would not have to relocate.\u00a0\nHe also challenged the low rating on ability to expand when the centre would be placed in a nearly vacant commercial building.\u00a0\nCasey said the move to RCMP headquarters would also potentially put people at risk in Nova Scotia.\nThe decision to move the centre to the Mounties' Nova Scotia headquarters would place it about 10 kilometres from the Halifax Regional Police's own communications facility.\u00a0\nA 2004 RCMP report that initially led to the centralizing of communications at the centre in Truro specifically recommended against placing it in Halifax because it posed a risk that one event could\u00a0undermine the communication centres\u00a0of both the regional police and the RCMP.\u00a0\nSeveral emergency organizations, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, recommend placing emergency operations centres in separate locations.\n\"To me it became a safety issue for all of Nova Scotia,\" said Casey.\nThe Nova Scotia RCMP said in a statement that it has contingency plans should an event undermine its communications centre once it's moved to Dartmouth. The statement said these continuity plans passed a third-party review.\n\"Contingency plan for 'H' Division RCMP includes a back-up RCMP [communications centre] located outside of the [Halifax Regional Municipality] and portable equipment that would allow us to restart operations should both the primary and back-up [centre] be non-operational,\" said the statement.\nThe 2017 report made no mention of the 2004 recommendation in its ranking of potential sites.\n"}, {"author": "Hallie Cotnam", "title": "Ottawa's hot housing market cooled, but not frozen, by COVID-19", "description": "Sales down 70% but some buyers, sellers forge ahead", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/covid-19-real-estate-ottawa-sellers-market-reduced-inventory-1.5539841", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4906657.1587666422!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/crea-home-sales-20180413.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 25, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-25T10:25:58.222Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ottawa's hot housing market was off to a prosperous start this year. Then came the coronavirus.\nBut while the pandemic has definitely put a damper on things, some homebuyers continue to buy, and some sellers continue to sell. Here's how they're doing it.\nDon Collins is trying to sell his four-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot\u00a0bungalow in Carp before moving to a new home in Manotick.\nHe put the house on the market just before the COVID-19 crisis, and is asking $779,000. There were a\u00a0few showings earlier in March, but those have now\u00a0dried up. He's had no offers, but he's not panicking. He hasn't lowered his price.\nCollins believes the bungalow, with an in-law suite on the main floor and another\u00a0unit\u00a0in the basement, would be perfect for families hoping to get elderly relatives out of long-term care homes, where the virus has taken hold.\n\"We're close to Almonte, and all I can think of is the people in the rest homes,\" he said. \"We're not in a rush to sell, but I think the house is of value to somebody.\"\nCollins said he hasn't decided on his next move, and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic isn't helping.\n\"Leave it on the market\u00a0or take it off? At the end of the day, nobody knows where we're going to be in six\u00a0months.\"\nThat uncertainty is keeping many people out of the market at a time of year that's traditionally the busiest. But not everyone is lying low.\nTrinh Yogaratnam\u00a0and her husband had planned to list their semi-detatched home in Old Ottawa South at the end of March. They'd\u00a0already purchased a new home in the Glebe\u00a0with an August close date.\u00a0Then COVID-19 struck.\u00a0\n\"We decided maybe we should just hold off. But then \u2026\u00a0we realized that it wasn't just a pandemic. It might be a deep recession,\" she said.\nYogaratban said their realtor, Shan Cappuccino, told them\u00a0the market was \"still quite buoyant,\" so the couple\u00a0decided to go ahead.\u00a0\nThe house was listed\u00a0April 14. The family moved into an Airbnb rental\u00a0for a week while their realtor held showings\u00a0\u2014 following strict physical distancing protocols, of course.\u00a0Prospective buyers could also take a\u00a0virtual tour.\n\"We got offers,\" Yogaratnam said. \"We actually got six offers.\"\nThe house\u00a0sold April 21\u00a0for more than their asking price, with no conditions.\n\"I was shocked. I was pleasantly surprised,\" Yogaratnam\u00a0said. \"We were reading all the articles leading up to it seeing how the real estate market was kind of tanking and how home sales were decreasing. I realized very quickly that when you say home sales, it's not synonymous with home prices.\"\nShe said they have no regrets about forging ahead.\n\"It is a little bananas to be doing it during this time,\" she said. \"But on the other hand, there are still people looking. Some of the people that made offers on our place had already sold theirs. So there was desperation on their part to buy as well as [on] our part to sell.\"\n\"At the beginning, it was a complete shutdown,\" said\u00a0Ottawa realtor Gloria Yankowich.\nBut now, six weeks in, things are starting to change, she said, as buyers, sellers\u00a0and agents\u00a0figure\u00a0out creative ways to mitigate their risk through virtual tours and conditional sales.\n\"I\u00a0don't know how many of us in the past have bought a house sight unseen, but it is happening,\" Yankowich said.\nAccording to realtor Paddy McCarthy, agents\u00a0have been deemed essential so people can avoid \"financial catastrophe.\"\n\"Most people don't want to [list],\u00a0but there are people who don't have a choice,\" he said. \"In February, we might have received seven offers on a place. Now there's only two or three, but they're still selling.\"\nNevertheless, realtors know there could be lean times ahead, especially if the slowdown lingers into the summer.\n\"We work in a high-risk, high-reward industry,\" McCarthy said. \"There will be a lot of realtors leaving the industry\u00a0if they haven't set aside enough [savings] to weather this storm.\"\nRealtor Peggy Blair said she's also encountering clients who simply don't have a choice.\n\"I've met two people this week who are paramedics who are starting with the City of Ottawa, moving here from other centres. They have to find places to live,\" she said.\nBlair points out the Ottawa real estate market was \"superheated\" right up until the pandemic.\n\"We were already in a situation of \u2026 unprecedented tight inventory. It's simply gotten tighter because people who don't have to sell are not selling.\"\nAnd don't expect a COVID-19\u00a0discount, Blair warned.\n\"I have some prospective buyers ... who have been sitting on the fence\u00a0hoping that there will be bargains out there, and I have to keep telling them at this point there are no bargains,\" she said. \"I was involved in a multiple offer situation on Friday. That property sold for \u2026 $42,000 over asking. They had 12 offers. Pre-March 15, they probably would have had 30 offers.\"\nBlair was able to find a house for those paramedics. \"They're actually moving in this weekend,\" she said.\nListings have \"definitely dropped to a trickle,\" said\u00a0Deborah Burgoyne, president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board. \"Some people are actively out there trading, but I would say the majority of them are not.\"\nBurgoyne said the year was off to a great start before the pandemic.\n\"We had surpassed last year's numbers, and then starting the third and fourth week of March we started to decrease. And the first two weeks of April, we're significantly lower.\"\u00a0\nBurgoyne said despite that, she's not surprised some people are still buying homes.\n\"There was a real pent-up demand. There were a lot of people that couldn't get into the market. They were pursuing multiple properties and losing out for one reason or another.\"\u00a0\nThe pandemic might actually help some families looking to buy, Burgoyne said. \"You know what? Maybe I'll have a chance because there won't be 10 people pursuing this property. There will be three.\"\nThat's likely to continue the longer the pandemic goes on.\n\"If you're priced at market value, I still believe you're going to have a good return,\" she said. \"It's not a feeding frenzy the way it was.\"\n"}, {"author": "Troy Turner", "title": "Soup for you!

That's an increase of 11.2 per cent from the same month a year earlier.\nJanuary is not typically a big month for home selling, as cold weather keeps would-be buyers indoors. So while the number of homes sold in January was slightly lower than it was in December, the sales volume was enough to make it the strongest January for house sales since 2008.

That housing is affiliated with the Red Lake homeless shelter.\n\"[The transitional housing is]\u00a0for individuals that are ready to start moving on, and so, it's part of the shelter program, but it's one step removed from having to be in a shelter,\" he said.\nThe program is successful, he said, with nearly half of those who identified as homeless, no longer at the shelter.

What are the missing links?\"\nA big reason for the success, Wall said, is partnerships with groups in the community. In Red Lake, the district social services board worked with the Red Lake Non-Profit Housing Corporation to secure an existing building and renovate it.\u00a0\nCommunity leadership, including mayor and council, has made the success possible, he said, pointing to re-zoning a building that was ideal for a shelter.\nShelters in the northwest are busy.\u00a0Facilities in Red Lake, Sioux Lookout, and Kenora had 17,000 nightly stays in 2019.

But while it didn't have the visual and audible impact an offline rally might, it did\u00a0attract\u00a0more than 500 people. Who can remember the last time an in-person rally attracted that many people to city hall?\nThe rally is in advance of one of the most important firsts ever at city hall\u00a0\u2014 a major policy debate Monday that will occur\u00a0online, with\u00a0public delegations phoning in their comments.\nThe once-in-a-decade issue is the urban boundary expansion, a policy decision that will literally affect the growth of this city for decades to come.\u00a0\nThe crux of the argument is this: the city says we need to add 181,000 homes to the city in the next 25 years or so.\nThe hold-the-liners want those new homes to be accommodated in existing neighbourhoods and on empty land already\u00a0approved for residential development.\nThe city's planners\u00a0\u2014 and Mayor Jim Watson\u00a0\u2014 don't believe residents\u00a0or builders are prepared for the sort of change communities would undergo if the\u00a0boundary remained steady. Instead, they're advocating to add\u00a0up to 1,650 hectares to Ottawa's\u00a0urban edges.\nMore than 23,000 new homes would be built in these newly urbanized\u00a0areas.\nAnd home builders have suggested that even 1,650 hectares won't be enough to absorb Ottawa's growing population, which the city forecasts at 1.4 million by 2046.\nAdd in serious questions about\u00a0housing affordability\u00a0\u2014 there are many points of contention\u00a0about how, or even if,\u00a0border expansion affects house prices\u00a0\u2014 plus rising infrastructure costs in a spreading\u00a0city, some communities'\u00a0unwillingness to accept dramatic change, and whether expanding the urban boundary squares with the city's declaration\u00a0of a climate emergency, and you've got yourself one messy policy debate.\nIt's hard to imagine, then, why anyone thought the urban boundary debate would be the ideal test-case for something the city has never tried in its history.\nEveryone is figuring\u00a0out how to live with the COVID-19 pandemic, including city hall, where councillors have met for three virtual council meetings so far.\u00a0\nThey went fine, but the public isn't allowed to participate at council the way they are at committee. When council voted in late March to\u00a0allow virtual committee meetings, it directed staff to figure out how to let the public speak, starting with the one on the urban boundary.\nThe rules for the virtual meeting will be\u00a0more stringent than in-person meetings. If you want to give your five-minute deputation, you have to register\u00a0online by 9 a.m. Monday, before the meeting starts. In so-called normal times, members of the public could\u00a0keep signing up to speak right through the meeting, until councillors began debating.\nAnd if you can't or are not inclined to register online, you could have done so by phone or email\u00a0\u2014but that deadline was Friday evening.\nThe mayor argued on CBC's Ottawa Morning this week\u00a0that sharing one's opinions virtually\u00a0actually makes it \"easier for the public to participate in the process, simply because you don't have to go and get daycare, you don't have to pay for parking or come down to city hall.\"\nHe may have a point: as of Friday evening, a whopping 150 people had signed up to speak\u00a0\u2014 and that's on top of the 150 who've already sent in written comments. The last time we saw that kind of action at city hall was for the Salvation Army debate, which spanned three exceedingly long days.\u00a0\nCoun. Shawn Menard, who's been\u00a0calling for the urban boundary to remain steady, said at\u00a0Friday's rally: \"This vote really\u00a0shouldn't be happening at this moment.\"\nHe argued more time is needed to question many\u00a0of the assumptions made in the staff recommendations, from the financial implications of expanding the boundary to the\u00a0declaration that the public wouldn't accept intensification.\nBut perhaps another reason the vote shouldn't happen is because it's a major policy decision being made in the most unusual times most of us have lived through.\u00a0\nYes, there's been a year of consultations.\u00a0 And the city says more than 45,000 people \"have been reached.\" The report's been out for three weeks\u00a0\u2014 longer than is legally required\u00a0\u2014 but during a time when we\u00a0are preoccupied with a dramatic and\u00a0stressful pandemic.\nThe city has argued that the urban boundary question\u00a0must be decided soon because it paves the way for other major policies that follow, including the official plan and transportation master plan updates. But city manager Steve Kanellakos mentioned recently the transportation plan work may have to be put off anyway, due to COVID-19 related constraints facing staff.\u00a0\nSo what's the rush?\nIn fact, there is no legal reason this decision needs to be made now. Council put off a byelection\u00a0for months, so it could certainly have given the public a bit more time to adjust to the COVID-19 reality,\u00a0to start paying attention to issues other than handwashing and physical distancing.\nAt the very least, it could have chosen a less vital issue with which to experiment with an untested democratic process.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Alberta's spring housing market falling to COVID-19, energy crisis, statistics show", "description": "'This is an unprecedented time with a significant amount of uncertainty'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-housing-market-coronovirus-1.5523434", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5501792.1584555691!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/house-for-sale-in-n-w-calgary.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 06, 2020 1:25 PM MT", "2020-04-06T19:25:35.957Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Physical distancing is meant to\u00a0flatten\u00a0the curve of the spread of COVID-19\u00a0among Albertans.\nBut it's also\u00a0flattening\u00a0the real estate industry in a province already reeling from a\u00a0dramatic\u00a0drop in energy prices, the Alberta Real Estate Association says.\nAfter a promising start to March,\u00a0real estate sales in the second half of the month dropped in Alberta by nine per cent over March 2019, while new listings declined by 15 per cent, the organization said in a Monday news release.\n\"This is an unprecedented time with a significant amount of uncertainty,\"\u00a0Ann-Marie Lurie, AREA's chief economist, said in the release.\u00a0\"It is not a surprise to see these concerns also weigh on the housing market.\"\nLurie added\u00a0the impact \"will likely persist over the next several quarters.\"\u00a0\nCalgary's housing market had become sluggish long before the pandemic arrived in Alberta, with sales figures and prices dropping since about 2017.\u00a0\nAs a result, the almost 10-per-cent decline in March sales over last year doesn't seem too ominous\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it does mean home sales are now tracking at 24 per cent below the five-year average, according to AREA statistics.\u00a0\nNew listings in the Calgary region dropped by\u00a0almost 19 per cent, which the organization said could help take pressure off the overstocked market, the release said.\n\"The Calgary market was already struggling with oversupply and price declines prior to the recent changes caused by the pandemic and oil price crash.\n\"The reductions in both demand and supply will help prevent steeper price declines.\"\nIn contrast, sales in Edmonton barely changed over last March, dropping by less than two per cent to 1,304.

Currently, sales are tracking at 21 per cent lower than the five-year average.\nAlso taking a significant hit was Grande Prairie. The oil-and-gas community in northwestern Alberta saw its sales drop by 19 per cent over last year.\nCentral Alberta was the only region to record relatively stable sales in March compared to last year.

And, as a city, we really feel that that's really important,\" said John Stark, New Westminster's supervisor of community planning.\u00a0\nHowever, depending on the offer it gets from non-profits, the city said it may choose to offer a free 60 year lease, instead of a permanent donation. Each deal would include mandatory conditions to provide affordable housing. \u00a0\nProviding free land is a relatively new push for the City of New Westminster, but other levels of government are increasingly looking to their own land holdings as a housing solution.\nThe City of Vancouver called\u00a0providing city-owned land to non-profits and government agencies a key approach in the quest for affordable housing. The province of B.C. was\u00a0also on board with using publicly-owned land to create more affordable housing.\u00a0\nWith property prices sky high, incentives to build affordable housing are becoming increasingly crucial to woo developers, said Michael Mortensen, who advises developers under the Liveable City Planning banner.\nEven private developers struggle with rising costs which makes choosing to build affordable housing a difficult option, he says.\n\"People have misconceptions about how much profit developers are looking for,\" Mortensen said.\u00a0\nThe profit difference compared to a condo project is huge, according to Mortensen. He says\u00a0most developers are looking for a 15 per cent return on costs, whereas rental properties usually average around six per cent net yield on capital invested.\nHe says\u00a0it's already tough to get those returns with increasing costs\u00a0and accepting a lower profit margin can make it harder to secure financing.\nBut while leveraging publicly-owned land to create more affordable housing is something all levels of government seem to agree on, giving it away for free to\u00a0private developers isn't something many of them are keen on.\nFor the current provincial government, it's a hard no.\u00a0\n\"Public land belongs to the people of B.C. and should benefit them, not wealthy corporations,\" said the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in a statement.\u00a0\nAndy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University, agrees.\nHe pointed to the Little Mountain housing development site in Vancouver as a cautionary tale.\nThe provincial government sold the land to private developer Holborn Holdings Ltd. in 2007 at a fraction of the assessed value.\nYears later, the demolished social housing units the company promised to replace are years away from completion.\n\"When the BC Liberals chose to sell off public land, in many cases for less than the land could have been worth, they gave away control and the opportunity to use that land to provide affordable housing for people,\" said the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in its statement.\u00a0\nMortensen says\u00a0private developers are still a key part of the housing solution. \u00a0\n\"When you have the creativity of the development industry and partner with them ... we can produce more housing.\u00a0We can do it at virtually no cost to the taxpayer,\" he said.\u00a0\nAaron Pietras\u00a0said finding an affordable place to live has made a huge difference in his life\u00a0and\u00a0allowed him to have true privacy for the first time.\u00a0\n\"I feel like I'm the king of the world right now,\" Pietras said. \"It's like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.\"\nBut while Pietras\u00a0felt lucky to have his new home, he said accessible and affordable housing for others with disabilities is still hard to find.\n\"It's very challenging you know,\" he said.\u00a0\nTreading Water is a series from CBC British Columbia examining the impact of the affordability crisis on people in Metro Vancouver and across the province, including the creative solutions being used to make ends meet.\nIf you have a story for our Treading Water series, please click\u00a0here\u00a0and tell us about it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Home sales fell 14% in March as COVID-19 settled in, CREA says", "description": "Average selling price basically unchanged from February, but sales were way down", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crea-march-real-estate-1.5532748", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5531982.1587750906!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-sign-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 15, 2020 9:47 AM ET", "2020-04-15T19:08:53.903Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Home sales fell by 14 per cent in March as COVID-19 lockdowns slowed the market to a crawl, the Canadian Real Estate Association says.\nThe group that represents 130,000 real estate agents\u00a0across the country said Wednesday that the month started out strong but slowed dramatically in the second half, \"as the economic turmoil and physical distancing rules surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic caused both buyers and sellers to increasingly retreat to the sidelines.\"\nSales were down just about everywhere from February's level, including in the following cities:\n\"March 2020 will be remembered around the planet for a long time,\" CREA president Jason Stephen said.\u00a0\"Canadian home sales and listings were increasing heading into what was expected to be a busy spring [but] after Friday the 13th, everything went sideways.\"\nThe month started out strong and then completely froze in the second half, which threw the overall monthly figure out of whack, said\u00a0CREA's senior economist Shaun Cathcart.\n\"Preliminary data from the first week of April suggest both sales and new listings were only about half of what would be normal for that time of year,\" he said.\nOn the price side, the average sale price for a home that sold during the month was just over $540,000.

Now, however, they are under government-ordered quarantine, battling boredom, frustration and anxiety in a sprawling dormitory complex called S11 at Punggol, home to about 2,000 of the overall cases.\n\"If one is infected, it would easily spread among others,\" Rahman said. \"Currently we are confined to our room. Everyone is scared. We are just praying to Allah \u2026 praying five times a day.\"\nS11 is one of many utilitarian housing blocks on the fringes of the modern city-state where more than 300,000 migrant labourers from Bangladesh, India and China live in rooms with bunks for 12 to 20 men, working jobs that pay as little as $20 Cdn a day.\nThese dormitories, in areas tourists seldom visit, account for more than 75 per cent of the country's total infections after the city-state recorded its biggest jump in new cases on Monday. Nineteen dormitories have been quarantined so far, according to government notices, affecting tens of thousands of workers.\nRights groups have said the dormitories have highlighted a weak link in Singapore's containment effort, which has otherwise won global plaudits. And critics say such mass quarantines could increase the risk of infection in the blocks.\nSingapore authorities say that they have taken preventative measures in migrant housing since the start of the city-state's outbreak in January but that the quarantine measures were necessary once the virus spread.\nS11, the company that operates the dormitory, the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment.\nReuters spoke with 12 residents at the S11 complex, a row of low-rise steel buildings of different colours behind high metal fences. Some workers declined to be identified for fear it would worry their families or put their jobs at risk.\nThe workers said they leave their rooms only to use the bathroom, and meals are delivered. Their days are spent streaming movies on their phones, peering out of balconies draped with laundry, or chatting with concerned family members back home, they said.\nSome S11 residents complained about the sanitation, the lack of precautions and monotony in the dormitories. Others praised the Singapore government's response.\nBut all were afraid of catching the virus.\nFor Nayem Ahmed, a 26-year old construction worker from Bangladesh, that fear was realized.\nOne of his roommates had been infected, so when he awoke on April 8 feeling feverish, he immediately alerted medical staff in the dormitory.\nThey tested him and while he awaited the results, he said, he was moved to an isolation facility outside the dormitory. Two days later, he was told he had been infected.\n\"I can't express how I felt when I heard that. I thought I would not live anymore,\" Ahmed said.\nAhmed said he was given paracetemol, and underwent blood tests and a chest X-ray in a hospital. After a few days, he was moved to a converted conference centre called Expo, which is being used to house patients with mild symptoms.\n\"I feel like I have got a new life,\" Ahmed said.\nAhmed said he is thankful to the Singapore government for providing health care and food, and making sure quarantined workers are paid. But he said more should have been done to address the risks of outbreaks in dormitories.\n\"Dormitories are crowded and dirty. No wonder the dormitories have become a hotbed for coronavirus infection,\" Ahmed said. \"Now we are paying the price.\"\nOther workers also flagged hygiene issues in the dormitories shortly after quarantine measures were announced on April 5.\nThe Ministry of Manpower has said it faced \"challenges\" at the start of the quarantine related to hygiene and the supply of food in the dormitories, but that it had been working with operators to improve conditions.\nS11, which operates the Punggol facility and another near the city's airport, advertises the \"cheapest dormitories in Singapore.\" The dormitory at Punggol can house up to 14,000 workers in four-story buildings on about 5.8 hectares, roughly the same area as eight soccer pitches, according to local media reports.\nThere are 43 such purpose-built dormitories in Singapore, housing 200,000 workers, 1,200 converted factories housing 95,000 workers and various other smaller temporary quarters, according to the Ministry of Manpower.\nSince the start of the outbreak, the Singapore government has said it has been advising dormitory operators to monitor workers for fever, encourage personal hygiene and limit mingling in common areas to reduce infection risk.\nBut Nizamul, 27, and other workers who declined to be identified, said that temperature checks were rare at S11 and that a fingerprint scanner was used for entry and exit into the complex just days before the government quarantine.\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Scientists say it spreads through droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, and by people coming in contact with contaminated surfaces before touching their nose, mouth or eyes.\nNizamul said before the quarantine he had shared a room with an Indian man who was put on sick leave because of\u00a0a cold and fever, then tested positive for the coronavirus days later when his health deteriorated.\nNizamul said he was moved to a public housing complex and given his own room, and has not tested positive.\nMiah Palash, 27, was one of the few S11 residents Reuters spoke with who said he did not know of any cases in his block.\nOnly allowed to leave his room to use a shared washroom, Palash said the biggest challenge was finding ways to pass the time and trying to ease the anxiety for his family back home.\n\"They're just wishing for me. I'm the only son. They're worried but \u2026 I call them every day,\" Palash said.\n"}, {"author": "Josee St-Onge", "title": "Councillors to consider affordable housing proposals for city-owned land in Riverdale", "description": "Four of five options require the city to sell the land for a dollar", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/affordable-housing-riverdale-1.5418536", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5418538.1578452235!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/riverdale-vacant-lot-edmonton.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 08, 2020 6:00 AM MT", "2020-01-08T13:00:00.615Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Building affordable housing on a vacant city-owned lot in Edmonton's Riverdale neighbourhood is a feasible development project, according to a report prepared for city councillors.\u00a0\nCouncil's executive committee will look at five possible options for building on the site during its next meeting on Jan. 13.\u00a0\nThe submissions were provided by developers during an expression of interest process that ended last June.\u00a0\nFour of the five options would require the city to sell the land for a dollar.

For 10 years in this apartment, he's tended to dozens of vines that have climbed up walls and now drape overhead. With his pending eviction, he said\u00a0he's been thinking about how to disentangle them for the move.\nBut first, Hatfield has to find a new place to live, and he, like many of his neighbours, is struggling to find something he can afford. He currently pays $550 per month, all-in. The average rent for a bachelor apartment in Halifax is $812.\nEvery tenant at 23 Crystal Dr. is being evicted this spring so the property owners can renovate the building and raise the rent. The owners have told tenants they want to keep the building \"affordable,\" and tenants can reapply after renovations.\nBut the proposed new rent, $875 per month, is too high for many people currently living there.\nIn a notice dated Jan. 30, 2020, the owners told tenants they would have to move out by the end of April for \"extensive demolition, repairs and renovations.\"\nIt's signed by Central East Developments,\u00a0a company co-owned by Spencer Meens and Adam Barrett, according to the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks. They did not respond to interview requests from CBC\u00a0News.\n\"It's what has been, I guess nicknamed, or phrased as 'renovictions,'\" said\u00a0Hatfield.\nIt's a scenario the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) described in its latest report on the Halifax rental market. It said\u00a0a record-low vacancy rate, coupled with record-high new development, is driving rents up and making housing less affordable.\nIn January, CMHC reported rental vacancy had dropped to one per cent,\u00a0which is\u00a0the fifth annual drop in as many years,\u00a0and the lowest number since it started reporting rental vacancy data in Halifax in 1990.\nMore than 4,000 new rental units have entered the rental market since 2017, but \"new apartment supply is not coming onto the rental market fast enough to offset increased demand,\" the report said. CMHC attributes growing demand to high rates of immigration and interprovincial migration.\nThe new construction has created what CMHC called a \"very high\" proportion of newer units on the Halifax market, compared to other Canadian cities.\n\"This has increased the quality of rental stock, incentivized older buildings to upgrade in order to compete and affected affordability, because rents have increased faster than disposable income,\" the report said.\nThe one per cent vacancy rate is top of mind for tenants in the building.\n\"That's really, really, really daunting when you're looking for a place,\" Hatfield said.\nProspective rentals have either been \"too gross\" or too expensive, so Hatfield is trying to find a roommate. But, he said\u00a0he worries about splitting living expenses.\n\"You're depending on other people to pay their bills, and you can't always do that,\" he said.\nIn the January eviction notice, Central East Developments listed five companies \"with apartments currently for rent.\"\nHatfield's downstairs neighbour, Daniel Kearley, said he's looked for apartments with each of the suggested companies. In some instances, he said he applied and was rejected.\u00a0In others, the prices were too high.\nKearley and Hatfield are both on fixed incomes, paid for by the province's disability support program.\n\"I'm having extreme difficulties finding anything,\" Kearley said.\nAfter 10 years working around housing and homelessness, Darcy Gillis has seen cases like the one at 23 Crystal Dr. before, but he said\u00a0they're becoming more common.\nGillis is a housing support worker at Dartmouth Housing Help, a non-profit that works with individuals who have challenges finding and keeping stable housing.\nGillis said\u00a0many apartment buildings in North Dartmouth are around the same age as 23 Crystal Dr.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which was built in 1976\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and renovations are to be expected.\nThere have been five recent complaints filed against 23 Crystal Drive's\u00a0owners under bylaw M-200, which sets minimum living standards for all residences, said a spokesperson for the Halifax Regional Municipality.\nThe spokesperson would not divulge the specifics of the complaints, but said HRM responded to each of them and closed the files.\nCentral East Developments bought the building in December, and Gillis said he respects the new owners for taking on deferred maintenance, but evicting tenants leaves them \"in a lurch.\"\n\"It's really unfortunate,\" Gillis said. \"There's no plan for individuals who are being mass evicted for building renovations.\"\nGillis is currently trying to help six tenants at 23 Crystal Dr. find new housing, but he said it's challenging.\n\"Really, there's just nothing available,\" he said.\n\"Low income is always going to be a barrier. And with the vacancy rates so low, the landlords aren't really considering people who don't have as much money.\"\nThe Nova Scotia government added more than 500 new rent supplements \u2014 which are meant to close the gap between what renters can afford and what the market is charging \u2014 to the 2020-21 budget.\nBut Gillis said additional rent supplements can become redundant in a tight rental market.\nSome tenants have already moved out of 23 Crystal Dr. The doors on six units hang open and renovations are well underway.\nIn empty units and common hallways, the floors have been stripped down to plywood\u00a0and construction crews are putting up walls to turn the bachelor apartments into one-bedrooms.\nIf any tenants remain come May 1, Gillis said\u00a0they have a few options.\nIf they're on income assistance, the province could move them into a hotel, temporarily. If not, Gillis said\u00a0he would usually refer them to a shelter. But lately, many Halifax shelters have been full.\n\"So... if the individual doesn't have family or friends, most of them would have to go out onto the streets, which is scary,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Natalia Goodwin ", "title": "'Broke on payday': Facing eviction, longtime tenants feeling Ottawa's housing squeeze firsthand", "description": "8 men must be out of their Fisher Park rooming house by end of March", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/on-ottawa-housing-emergency-1.5446640", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5446660.1580420999!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hamilton-ave-house.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 31, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-31T17:00:16.608Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Entering Ed Campbell's small apartment in Ottawa's Fisher Park\u00a0neighbourhood, the signs of an impending move are all around.\nAn old brown leather suitcase sits packed with clothes and shoes, and plastic bags full of belongings are\u00a0piled in the bedroom.

It also references a report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives showing someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment here.\u00a0\nHousing prices have also been on an upward trend for years, even when sales are down.\nSeveral other councillors echoed her belief on\u00a0the impact of speculation. There's no local data around how much vacant property has driven up real estate prices. But after Vancouver implemented an empty homes tax,\u00a0vacant property fell by 15 per cent from 2017 to 2018. The program has also helped return just over half of previously empty homes to the rental market.\nThe vacancy rate there is less than one per cent. That city started taxing empty homes an extra one per cent in 2016, and recently increased it to 1.25 per cent. In the last three years, the tax has generated $39.7 million in net revenue, which the city puts toward affordable housing initiatives.\u00a0\nIt could\u00a0be challenging to identify what units are vacant, said Jason Thorne, Hamilton's general manager of planning and economic development. The city can use tax roles to track vacant units in multi-residential properties, he said, but it's trickier to track smaller buildings.\nThree members of the general issues committee \u2014\u00a0Couns. Sam Merulla, Arlene VanderBeek and Maria Pearson \u2014 are landlords and declared a conflict of interest. But before he realized the conflict, Merulla was prepared to second it.\nMerulla, who represents\u00a0Ward 4 (east end), said developers are buying blocks of units and leaving them empty.\n\"They'll buy two, three, four condominiums and they'll flip them later,\" he said. \"They are buying in bulk.\"\nJohn-Paul Danko of Ward 8 (west Mountain) says it happens\u00a0on the Mountain too.\n\"People are purchasing residential property never intending to live there,\" he said.\nAs it stands, he said, \"the housing market is being driven by speculation, and (young people)\u00a0have zero chance of ever entering that market.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "What you need to know about COVID-19 in B.C. on April 19, 2020", "description": "Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry announced three new coronavirus deaths on Saturday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-bc-update-what-you-need-to-know-april-19-1.5537545", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5537752.1587315488!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sherry-ann-walters-vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 19, 2020 5:00 AM PT", "2020-04-19T23:06:35.130Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "THE LATEST:\nB.C.'s Minister of Public Safety Mike Farnworth\u00a0announced on Sunday morning that he has\u00a0has enabled\u00a0police to issue $2,000 fines for\u00a0people engaged in price gouging\u00a0and reselling of medical supplies.\nFarnworth said Consumer Protection B.C. had gotten more than 800 reports complaining about price gouging.\u00a0\nPeople who fail to self-quarantine after returning from travel can also face fines.\u00a0\nFarnworth said that with most people complying with physical distancing, there is no plan to close down public spaces at beaches and in parks.\nVancouver police arrested 14\u00a0people after a group of community members of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside broke into Lord Strathcona Elementary School on Saturday evening to use it for what they called \"emergency housing.\"\nSpokespeople for the group said the action was taken because\u00a0it was impossible for thousands of homeless people to follow the provincial government's instructions\u00a0to stay home amid the COVID-19 crisis.\nPolice said they will pursue charges of break-and-enter against the individuals arrested.\u00a0\nOn Sunday, the Vancouver Island MusicFest\u00a0announced \"with deep regret\" that the event is postponed because of COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"It's simply too risky for all of us,\" the festival wrote in an email.\u00a0\nThe festival, which takes place in the Comox Valley, was scheduled for July 10 to 12.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs of Saturday, B.C. had 1,647 confirmed cases of the virus and 81 people had died.

While many essential products have gotten more expensive, there are some exceptions.\u00a0\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures price increases for a fixed basket of goods and services. With that data, analysts can then attempt to parse\u00a0economic or industry-specific trends that drive inflation.\nTaylor Mitchell, lead analyst at Statistics Canada, says the Consumer Price Index helps researchers like her \"isolate as much as possible the sources of price changes from month to month.\"\nThe latest full year\u00a0we have data for is 2018, so these cost increases cover 2008 to 2018 to mark a full decade.\u00a0\nThe CPI's average increase \u2014 which is weighted to give prominence to items Canadians spend more on, such as gas\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was 14 per cent over that time frame.\nMeanwhile, the growth in median income across B.C. was 12 per cent\u00a0from 2005 to 2015. (Those numbers are tied to the census, which is why they\u00a0don't\u00a0match the same 10 years as the CPI.)\nOne of the categories where British Columbians are likely to have noticed the biggest change is the cost of food and beverages.\u00a0\nMitchell says the increase in fresh produce and meat has been noted across the country over the past decade.\nThe main factors driving the increase, she says, are exchange rates (because most of our produce come from the U.S.), transportation prices, and difficulties with growing seasons driven by inclement weather.\u00a0\nLucas Herrenbrueck, an economics professor at Simon Fraser University, said another factor driving the increased cost could be a rise in incomes.\u00a0\n\"We know that the wealthier you are the more you will probably spend on the freshness of your food,\"\u00a0Herrenbrueck said.\u00a0\nAnother large price increase in B.C. over the past decade was for utilities such as\u00a0internet and electricity.\u00a0\nThe widely reported increase in internet access costs over the past decade appears as an 83 per cent hike in the CPI \u2014 a number all the more striking when one considers that it's been adjusted for increases in bandwidth and data.\nBritish Columbians\u00a0are also paying more to get around. Again, any gain in quality\u00a0is accounted for in the cost increase.\u00a0\nIt will surprise no one to know that\u00a0people in Metro Vancouver are paying a lot more for housing.\nNote that the rental cost noted below is for secondary rental housing, not purpose-built rental housing.\nPurpose-built rental housing has also\u00a0increased, up 46 per cent for an average two-bedroom apartment \u2014 to\u00a0$1,652 in 2018 from $1,131 in 2008.\nIt may surprise some British Columbians to learn some prices have\u00a0actually dropped since 2008.\nHerrenbrueck says people tend to notice when prices go up, but not when they go down.\u00a0\n\"You don't really notice the things that happened in your favour,\" he said.\nThe decrease in prices of consumer goods is most likely due to better international trade in the past decade, Herrenbrueck said, especially as shipping from overseas markets has gotten cheaper.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe warns, though, that a drop in prices doesn't benefit everyone.\n\"If gas prices go down then that's good for people who commute but bad for people in the oil patch,\" he said, as an example.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Liam Britten", "title": "Critics say budget 2020 offers little to families struggling with affordability", "description": "Struggling families say budget misses opportunities to address child care, housing problems", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/budget-2020-affordability-1.5467239", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467956.1582075935!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bc-budget-2020-lock-up.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 3:00 AM PT", "2020-02-19T11:00:00.217Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Stephanie Clark said the 2020 provincial\u00a0budget, like others recently, was a mixed bag for families like hers.\nWhile government\u00a0MLAs clapped and thumped their desks in Victoria during the budget speech Tuesday,\u00a0many\u00a0facing affordability challenges\u00a0said there was little to cheer about.\n\"For our personal expenses, I\u00a0don't see a huge difference for our family,\" said Clark, a 37-year-old New Westminster mother.\nChild care and strata fees take a big bite out of Clark's bank account.\nLast year, the daycare Clark's three-year-old daughter, Fiona, attends\u00a0qualified for provincial funding that reduced fees by more than\u00a010 per cent \u2014 but this year, the daycare is upping\u00a0its fees 15 per cent.\u00a0\n\"Meaning we are going to be paying about a $1,000 a month,\" Clark said. \"So that's more expensive.\"\nAnd she's also disappointed there's no relief for strata homeowners in the budget with news of big hikes to insurance.\nIn Clark's building, the price of insurance has nearly tripled.

Open houses are still well-attended and quality properties are being snapped up quickly. Even detached homes at higher price points are starting to move.\u00a0\u00a0\nLow supply and high demand have pushed up prices \u2014 particularly in the case of condos which are selling at all-time highs.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo cushion the economic blow caused by COVID-19, central banks around the world have cut interest rates. Anyone with an existing variable mortgage, or someone looking to get one,\u00a0can expect their borrowing costs to decrease.\u00a0The Bank of Canada cut rates by a full percentage point\u00a0since the beginning of\u00a0March.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are also seeing investors flee the stock market and park their money in investment grade bonds. A result of this flight to safety is that fixed-term mortgage rates are dropping. Lower mortgage rates increase the amount a home buyer can borrow, which pushes up prices as borrowers are able to make higher offers.\u00a0\nWe also cannot forget about the mortgage stress test. On Feb.\u00a018, the federal government announced that the hurdle rate of the stress test would be lowered effective April 6.\u00a0 In anticipation of this change, many buyers re-entered the housing market, increasing demand on a real estate market with limited inventory.\u00a0 However, as of last Friday, the Department of Finance announced that changes to the stress test have been put on hold.\u00a0\nAll these factors are fuelling the housing market and not even COVID-19 appears to be able to slow it down\u00a0\u2014 yet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was just a month ago when stock markets were at an all-time high, largely due to the fear of missing out, whereas today it's\u00a0the opposite:\u00a0many people are panic selling.\nThe same could happen,\u00a0but to a lesser degree, with real estate, as buying psychology is fickle.\nIt's important to also keep in mind that, since all financial markets are interconnected, a stock market drop should affect the housing market. For example, many new buyers turn to the bank of mom and dad to help with their down payment. However, after experiencing a drop in their investment portfolio many parents will be less inclined, or no longer able, to help their children fund a down payment.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother important factor to consider is the potential loss of income that COVID-19 may cause. Some lenders might be hesitant to lend to applicants working in areas affected by the pandemic such as the travel or oil and gas industries.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll these variables can affect demand.\nIf I were a buyer, I would be cautious. Don't underestimate COVID-19's negative impacts on the economy, jobs and buyers' sentiment and avoid overstretching your budget \u2014 something that tends to happen when buying in a seller's market.\nMy advice to sellers who are looking to cash out or downsize\u00a0is to list their properties right away. Momentum is on your side and there is limited inventory, so sellers of quality homes are getting top dollar. The demand is currently high, but I wouldn't be complacent and assume that it will last. If offered a reasonable price, I would take it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you don't need to sell, I wouldn't and I'm not.

It is\u00a0an unbelievable economic development opportunity, social impact opportunity for the city of Hamilton, community engagement opportunity for our community to move forward.\nThis is not just about sports. It's about investment in infrastructure. It's about social impact. It's about dealing with all of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations which has been a major part of this. There are multiple reasons to do something that is economically sustainable, financially viable, socially impactful and community engaging. On so many different fronts this makes sense.\nWhat concrete infrastructure projects can we expect for Hamilton?\nSo, there's an opportunity to build a brand new aquatic centre\u00a0but then we looked down to Confederation Park. We've had immigration to Canada and there's an outcry for cricket pitches. So the city is building a world class cricket pitch but we're going to build a field house\u00a0with it so that we can have spectators there with\u00a0all the modern amenities,\u00a0a social area, meeting space, place to store their equipment, a place for the community to congregate and have some incredible cricket matches both at the local level and\u00a0the international level. Right\u00a0beside it, beach volleyball courts, both indoor and outdoor, so,\u00a0year round use. We're looking at refurbishing some of our older facilities like the Dave Andreychuk\u00a0arena to ensure our facilities are some of the best really in all of Canada, maybe North America.\nThe city of Vancouver promised,\u00a0for the Olympic bid,\u00a052 social housing units. In the end,\u00a0council approved a plan to rent half of those at market rates. Another 850 units were sold as condos at market rates out of range of\u00a0most people who desperately need housing. Can you guarantee your affordable housing estimates?\nKujavksi: You have a lot of progressive voices on that council who are going to insist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I don't speak on their behalf \u2014 but I have a pretty strong suspicion and sense that they are going to be watching this very, very closely and are going to insist that these guarantees in terms of percentages for affordable housing are locked into the agreements that are signed.\u00a0So, this is going to be as simple as a bunch of business people that are putting up some money afterwards saying 'oh yeah I know I promised that but now it's going to be this.' All of this is being done openly and transparently in negotiations with the city of Hamilton who have to be a signatory to this thing if it ever comes to fruition.\nHamilton 100 says the city's portion of that $425B is going to be $100 million. They city says it's going to be $300 million. How do you account for such a huge discrepancy?\nKujavsky: One hundred per cent\u00a0of games related revenue\u00a0stays with the host community. That is estimated at in excess of $225 million dollars. And I will state right here that by the time we get to 2030, and you look at the additional revenue sources\u00a0and opportunities\u00a0through sponsorships or through sport related activities, that could bring in huge dollars, especially when it comes to broadcast rights,\u00a0 you're going to see that the host community share of this entire thing because of the revenues that stay locally is going to make this profitable, not just break even, but profitable.\nSo the difference is that you have incorporated projected revenue?\nMaychak: Yes. But it's also based on past games and it's very, very conservative.\nIf our three levels of government have $1.5 Billion available to spend, I think we should build 10,000 units of affordable housing instead of hosting the Commonwealth Games for 11 days. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HamOnt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HamOnt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Onpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Onpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a>\nDan Jelly's comment raises this question \u2014 For $1.425 billion, why is the Commonwealth Games a better idea than spending that money on affordable housing, or LRT or any other bright idea that builds infrastructure?\nKujavsky: The issue then becomes 'well then why would you spend that money on affordable housing if we need money in our hospitals?'\u00a0And if you then spend\u00a0it on the hospital, someone else will say 'Well yeah but what about the water and sewer and hydro and fiber optics that all would have been a part of the LRT\u00a0investment that will be lost if that LRT project doesn't go ahead because 80 cents on every dollar spent on LRT would have gone to underground infrastructure?'\u00a0\nif you don't spend the money on the Commonwealth Games you will not get 75 percent funding for, for example, on amateur sports facilities and community projects that are needed in Hamilton, that have been identified by the city's real estate department. So, if we don't get the games what will happen is groups will go to the city and say 'we need this, we need that.' If the answer is always going to be 'well we're not doing any of that because we have to have this,' whether it's a health care related matter, an\u00a0education related matter or\u00a0affordable housing component. Then we shouldn't have any money spent, for example, on recreation. Any penny spent on recreation is not being spent somewhere else.

In Nov. 2019, home prices rose 10.7 per cent over last year to $416,116, putting the year in real estate on course to break records in terms of price.\u00a0\nAccording to data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), while 2019 sales in the London area didn't reach the record-breaking volume of 2017 where 11,247 homes traded hands, Nov. 2019\u00a0sales numbers were on par to meet or beat 2018 figures\u00a0with about 9,700 homes bought and sold.\nFor 2020, the CMHC predicts market activity in terms of existing home sales will be steady, with about 9,200 home sales on the low end and 10,200 on the high end.\u00a0\nIt's for that reason home prices are\u00a0expected to again reach new heights in 2020, according to Anthony Passarelli, a senior market analyst with the CMHC.\u00a0\n\"On the high end $450,000 and on the low end\u00a0$430,000,\" he said. \"The average price in the City of London, the range for that\u00a0you would bump it up a little bit higher.\"\u00a0\nWith average prices in the city already hovering around $430,000 as of November 2019, it could mean home prices in London could easily close in on the $450,000 threshold\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n\"That ties in to why you're seeing some extra demand going to areas like St. Thomas and Strathroy because some people are going out a little bit further from the city centre to afford the home they want.\"\u00a0\nHigh real estate prices are also having an effect on London's tight rental market, according to Passarelli, who said the area's double-digit price gains have kept the overall vacancy rate hovering at around two per cent since 2016, which is about half of the city's historical vacancy rate of about four per cent.\u00a0\n\"Our research shows a lot of first-time buyers come from the rental market,\" he said. \"The rental market is affected because some of those renters that would normally have left the rental market to buy may stay an extra year and that causes the vacancy rate to be low.\"\nThe average rental price for a two-bedroom unit\u00a0in London is expected to climb to about $1,160 a month, up from $1,130 the year before, according to CMHC data.\u00a0\nThe reason behind that, according to Passarelli, is London's strong economy, which includes good job numbers, steady wage growth and plenty of immigrants settling in the city.\u00a0\n\"Immigration has been high in recent years, a lot of immigrants tend to rent when they first come to the country, especially the first year,\" he said. \"Census data consistently shows that.\"\u00a0\nPassarelli notes that while a number of new highrises in the city have just come online or are being built, Passarelli said it's not enough to offset an average rent increase\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Justin McElroy", "title": "Anger over councillor's latte comment reveals affordability angst of the suburbs", "description": "Delta councillor's suggestion to scrimp and save drew viral anger as affordability continues to decline", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lois-jackson-lattes-delta-aftermath-1.5487921", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3660869.1467333216!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lois-jackson.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 06, 2020 8:09 AM PT", "2020-03-06T16:09:51.036Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Delta Coun.

The message was posted on their door.\n\"No letterhead, no signatures, just, 'Unfortunately, your time is up at the Travelodge,\" she said. \"You have until Feb. 21 at noon to be gone.'\"\nIt's part of a larger situation members of the NDP caucus have been highlighting in the first two days of the spring sitting at Province House.\nOn Friday, the party introduced legislation for short-term rentals that would require anyone running an Airbnb-style service, regardless of size, to register with the province.\nThe bill, which is unlikely to pass in the Liberal majority legislature, would also require rental platforms to provide information about the obligation of hosts to collect and remit HST.\nA sliding scale of fees, ranging from $20 per year for someone who rents a room in their own home up to $5,000 a year for platforms such as Airbnb, plus $1 per night per rented room, would be collected and paid to municipalities.\nThe bill also includes fines for people who operate without registering.\nNew Democrat Lisa Roberts, the Halifax-Needham MLA, said the bill has more teeth than legislation\u00a0from the government that will not require all short-term rentals to register. It also comes\u00a0with lower fees.\nRoberts said she wants to see the government be more responsive to a growing problem that's seeing more people challenged to find an affordable place to live, or to stay in their existing situation as landlords look to renovate or rebuild to try to capitalize on a booming housing market with razor-thin vacancy rates.\nFor the NDP, that would include some kind of rent control. Although Roberts conceded there is \"mixed evidence\" when it comes to rent control, she said there needs to be some level of protection for renters while also allowing property owners to make reasonable rent increases as necessary.\n\"We are getting contacted by constituents who have seen rent increases in hundreds of dollars per month,\" she told reporters at Province House.\n\"We're saying that where there isn't major capital improvements that there should be some connection between the amount that rent can go up and the general CPI, the general inflation and cost pressures.\"\nPremier Stephen McNeil told reporters that his government has \"a number of announcements that will come out over the next period of time\" related to housing.\nHe\u00a0said the government is reassessing some investments already made to determine if the effect has achieved the desired outcomes.\nMeetings are also planned with the municipality and the private sector to see what partnerships are possible to provide more options for people looking for housing, he said.\nThe government has a first-time home buyer program for families, but McNeil said he also realizes some people are just trying to find shelter overnight while confronting other issues.\n\"We need to wrap services around them, whether it's addictions services or mental health.

In Nov. 2019, home prices rose 10.7 per cent over last year to $416,116, putting the year in real estate on course to break records in terms of price.\u00a0\nAccording to data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), while 2019 sales in the London area didn't reach the record-breaking volume of 2017 where 11,247 homes traded hands, Nov. 2019\u00a0sales numbers were on par to meet or beat 2018 figures\u00a0with about 9,700 homes bought and sold.\nFor 2020, the CMHC predicts market activity in terms of existing home sales will be steady, with about 9,200 home sales on the low end and 10,200 on the high end.\u00a0\nIt's for that reason home prices are\u00a0expected to again reach new heights in 2020, according to Anthony Passarelli, a senior market analyst with the CMHC.\u00a0\n\"On the high end $450,000 and on the low end\u00a0$430,000,\" he said. \"The average price in the City of London, the range for that\u00a0you would bump it up a little bit higher.\"\u00a0\nWith average prices in the city already hovering around $430,000 as of November 2019, it could mean home prices in London could easily close in on the $450,000 threshold\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n\"That ties in to why you're seeing some extra demand going to areas like St. Thomas and Strathroy because some people are going out a little bit further from the city centre to afford the home they want.\"\u00a0\nHigh real estate prices are also having an effect on London's tight rental market, according to Passarelli, who said the area's double-digit price gains have kept the overall vacancy rate hovering at around two per cent since 2016, which is about half of the city's historical vacancy rate of about four per cent.\u00a0\n\"Our research shows a lot of first-time buyers come from the rental market,\" he said. \"The rental market is affected because some of those renters that would normally have left the rental market to buy may stay an extra year and that causes the vacancy rate to be low.\"\nThe average rental price for a two-bedroom unit\u00a0in London is expected to climb to about $1,160 a month, up from $1,130 the year before, according to CMHC data.\u00a0\nThe reason behind that, according to Passarelli, is London's strong economy, which includes good job numbers, steady wage growth and plenty of immigrants settling in the city.\u00a0\n\"Immigration has been high in recent years, a lot of immigrants tend to rent when they first come to the country, especially the first year,\" he said. \"Census data consistently shows that.\"\u00a0\nPassarelli notes that while a number of new highrises in the city have just come online or are being built, Passarelli said it's not enough to offset an average rent increase\u00a0in 2020.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Stephanie vanKampen", "title": "P.E.I.'s housing crisis forces Syrian refugees into cramped quarters", "description": "'We're looking around for an apartment and we certainly don't have anything for August'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-syrian-refugee-family-1.5216875", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3230075.1448482821!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/apartment-for-rent-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 19, 2019 6:00 AM AT", "2019-07-19T09:00:00.929Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group which sponsors refugees to come to P.E.I. is scrambling to find a home for a Syrian family on their way to\u00a0Charlottetown.\nThe couple and their 19-month-old child are flying from Jordan and will join members of their family already on the Island.\nBut due to a record-low vacancy rate in Charlottetown, the sponsors have not found a home for the new family.\u00a0\n\"When we first started this I don't think the vacancy rate was quite as bad as it is now,\" said Rosemary Henderson, chair of the Interfaith Refugee Sponsorship Group. \u00a0\nUntil a home can be found, the family will stay in a crowded three-bedroom apartment in Charlottetown that will house four adults and four children \u2014\u00a0including the newcomers.\u00a0\nIt can take months, even years, to finalize a sponsorship.\u00a0Henderson said part of the reason for the scramble is that the group only had two weeks' notice of the family's arrival.\n\"We didn't have enough money to just rent an apartment at some point hoping that they would come soon,\" said Henderson.\n\"Now we're looking around for an apartment and we certainly don't have anything for August but hoping perhaps we'll find something for September.\"\nThe latest family is the fifth family that the Interfaith Refugee Sponsorship Group has sponsored.\nThe group was formed in reaction to the Syrian civil war.

What the two tenants are essentially doing is a mutual lease transfer.\n\"Whether it's a swap or a reciprocal agreement or whatever you want to call it, the law still qualifies the tenant as a tenant,\" says Jamie Benizri, a lawyer who represents tenants and landlords with the firm Legal Logik.\nThat means that once you've found an ideal person to swap with, you send your landlord a notice to assign the lease with the name and address of the prospective tenant. Benizri recommends you do a credit check on the candidate and provide the report along with the application form.\n\"The credit check is going to be necessary, maybe even a docket search at the R\u00e9gie du logement, to make sure that there's no pending judgments against that person,\" he said.\n\"Letters of employment are often very, very helpful to build a file. So these three things for me are our pillar documents to show that somebody has the wherewithal and the capacity to replace you as a tenant.\"\nLandlords have 15 days to give the hopeful swappers a response, and the R\u00e9gie says that it can only be refused for \"serious reasons.\"\n\"Really, you can't discriminate,\" says Benizri. \"Now, you can profile and you can do a proper background check to make sure that the person can reasonably afford the rent, but in no other way could you discriminate against the candidate.\"\nWhile landlords are required to disclose the cheapest rent paid at an apartment in the last 12 months upon signing a new lease, that does not always happen. And in the current competitive housing market, a new tenant may just agree to pay the higher price.\nBenizri says tenants can go to the rental board if you find out, after signing, hat there has been an unreasonable rent increase.\nHans Brouillette, the director of public affairs with the\u00a0landlords' lobby group CORPIQ, said the phenomenon of swapping is \"kind of taking control of an apartment without the consent of the landlord.\"\n\"It should be the right of the landlord to decide who is going to live there,\" he said. \"It's very difficult for a landlord to refuse someone.\"\nProspective swappers with a lease below market value have no shortage of requests this year. What's tougher is finding someone who has what you want in return.\nOn Facebook groups and Kijiji posts, swappers often list a specific neighbourhood, size, maximum rent and other requests like pets being allowed or a backyard.\nAnn-July\u00a0Boily-Gagnon is looking for a place to live with her boyfriend. They want to stay in Hochelaga, and she says that\u00a0through swapping, it now looks like that is going to happen.\nAfter making a Kijiji ad for her $660-per-month studio and posting it in a Facebook group dedicated to swaps, the response \"has been quite fruitful,\" she said, and she's now setting up times to see prospective\u00a0apartments she\u00a0might swap hers for.\nTom Dunford acknowledges it's tough for those who don't already have a good lease to see attractive apartments that are out of their reach.\n\"It is very frustrating to see all these great apartments at great prices flying around, but if you don't have anything that's worth trading, then you're very much on the outside,\" said Dunford, who is looking to swap his place for the first time.\nWith a studio apartment in Mile End for less than $600 a month, he says he's getting lots of offers for a place that would be suitable for him to move in with his girlfriend.\n\"Now, with something of value that people want, the Kijiji response has surpassed my expectations,\" he said.\nAfter swapping last spring, Jacques Fontaine\u00a0says he and his girlfriend are\u00a0going to renew the lease on their\u00a0new place.\nHe said all last year's swap\u00a0cost them was $45 to provide their new landlord with a credit report, and\u00a0it was completely worth it.\n\"It's been very, very good for us, and I recommend it to anybody else,\" he said.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Real estate market hits new heights in Ottawa-Gatineau", "description": "Record comes amidst affordable housing shortage", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/housing-real-estate-homes-1.5415644", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5238836.1565195419!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/house-for-sale-ottawa-vanier-sign-real-estate-august-7-2019.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 06, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-06T09:00:00.663Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The number of house sales and\u00a0property\u00a0prices\u00a0soared in\u00a0the capital\u00a0last year and aren't showing any signs of slowing down.\nThe trend looks set to continue in 2020, but\u00a0comes at a time when the region is grappling with a lack of affordable housing.\n\"Each quarter, the properties have increased in value,\" said Angelo Toscano, a\u00a0real estate agent based in Orl\u00e9ans.\nOne of the biggest factors driving the\u00a0increase is\u00a0market demand.\n\"We started the year fairly stable.

Instead, many of them continue renting.\u00a0\nAs real estate continues to become more expensive, this trend\u00a0will continue, said Jasmin-Tucci.\u00a0\nWhile the real estate market is going strong, the region is also struggling with a lack of affordable housing.\nMany organizations have been sounding the alarm for months. The CMHC\u00a0estimates that Ottawa's rental housing vacancy rate was at 1.6 per cent in 2018, the last year for which there is data.\nAcross the Ottawa River, the vacancy rate in Gatineau\u00a0sits at 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the province.\nThe Quebec government has put in place an emergency assistance program to help people who are homeless, as well as to assist cities that are coping with\u00a0a housing shortage.\u00a0\nWhile the price of homes in the region continues to grow, advocacy groups persist in their\u00a0push for investments in affordable housing.\u00a0\nThere are approximately 10,000 people on the waiting list for social housing in Ottawa,\u00a0according to data from the City of Ottawa.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Sakamoto", "title": "'Homelessness can strike anyone.

The report says that between 2017 and 2018, Hamilton's average rents spiked 6.9 per cent \u2014\u00a0a rate higher than the provincial average.\u00a0\nThe non-profit says that the numbers are skyrocketing as\u00a0rents increase for\u00a0existing units and higher quality units\u00a0that cost more are built around the city.\u00a0\nAccording to the SPRC, eviction notices for reasons other than non-payment of rent,\u00a0such as\u00a0renovations that create these higher quality units, have more than doubled.\nThere were\u00a060 incidents recorded by the Landlord Tenant Board in 2010 and 150 recorded in 2018.\u00a0The non-profit said that the board does not track \"informal evictions,\" such as when amenities\u00a0like laundry rooms\u00a0close in a building, influencing its residents to live elsewhere.\u00a0\nThe number of these eviction notices, called L2 notices,\u00a0are highest in some of the most affordable rental neighbourhoods. The highest is in the Corktown and Stinson areas. Mayo said that when people move out, it allows these affordable prices to continually increase.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to rising costs, one-bedroom rentals in\u00a0the downtown core and mountain have seen the greatest increases in average rent, with a\u00a0whopping 40 per cent rise\u00a0from 2010 to 2018. The downtown core is also home to the most\u00a0rental units, while the mountain\u00a0comes second.\nThe mountain, however,\u00a0has\u00a0the largest number of family size units.\u00a0\nAreas with the greatest increase in average rent for two-bedroom rentals are the mountain and Hamilton's east and west ends.\u00a0\nWhen wages don't rise as quickly as rental prices, families need to pay a bigger part of their income for shelter. The SPRC's report says that 45.4 per cent of renter households are living in unaffordable housing, meaning they spend around 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.\nSome are spending even more \u2014 20\u00a0per cent of renters are spending 50 per cent or more of their income on housing.\nMayo said the\u00a0unaffordability rate shows the lack of affordable housing in Hamilton despite being\u00a0talked about as less expensive\u00a0than other places. When the housing market is discussed, she said, the problem is it often comes from a Toronto lens. And when the rates to live in Toronto are so high, it can paint a distorted picture of the rates in Hamilton.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0percentage of people using a high amount of their income is in line with\u00a0the provincial average \u2014\u00a045 per cent of people use 30 per cent of their income on rent, where 20.9 per cent use half of their income on average.\u00a0\u00a0\nMayo said\u00a0this highlights how people are struggling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Because Hamilton has 'low rent,' it's seen as 'oh, it's not as much of an issue,'\" she said. \"Rents are cheaper here, but incomes are lower in Hamilton, so we still have affordability challenges despite lower rents.\"\u00a0\nShe added that people might feel pressured to stay in an area despite difficulties\u00a0because of the intimidating and unaffordable prices out there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"People really feel trapped,\" she said. \"If they need to move because their job is in a different part of the city, well they can't move because if they leave their apartment, they'll leave affordable rent.\"\nThe non-profit\u00a0references a report from the think-tank Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which shows that someone earning minimum wage would have to work 54 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Hamilton.\u00a0\nFuture bulletins from the non-profit will focus on impacts to renters and the difficulties they face, as well as the buildings they live in.\n"}, {"author": "Isaac Olson", "title": "City of Montreal to exercise right of first refusal to turn properties for sale into social housing", "description": "Announcement part of city's plans to build 12,000 more social and affordable housing units by 2021", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/right-of-first-refusal-social-housing-1.5466347", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5466601.1581977835!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/plante.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 17, 2020 2:02 PM ET", "2020-02-18T00:31:47.665Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante says Montreal has identified 300 properties that it will attempt to buy and develop into social housing, using the city's right of\u00a0first refusal.\nThis means the city will have, before anybody else, the chance to buy land or buildings in areas where rental housing is particularly scarce, she told reporters on Monday.\nShe described the right of first refusal as another tool to respond to the city's rental housing shortage and \"offer quality housing at affordable prices and to maintain the diversity in our neighbourhoods.\"\nThe mayor stressed that exercising the right of first refusal is not the same as expropriation, as it only applies to properties that are already on the market and have an interested buyer.\nOnce a buyer makes an offer, the city has 60 days to step in on the\u00a0sale and match whatever offer is on the table, Coun.\u00a0Roger Beaudry explained.\n\"It's going to make no difference,\" said Beaudry, who is the executive committee member in charge of housing. \"It's going to be the city or the private owner that is going to own the land for the exact same price.\"\nThe city acquired the pre-emptive right to acquire property in 2016, in a landmark piece of legislation dubbed\u00a0R\u00e9flexe Montr\u00e9al, which was aimed at giving the city more powers over its own economic and social development and urban planning.\nSince then,\u00a0city has only exercised this power\u00a0to buy land for parks and other public infrastructure\u00a0while the rental housing vacancy rate has continued to erode, finally hitting a 15-year low of 1.5 per cent citywide this year.\nNotre administration se dote d'un nouvel outil pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des Montr\u00e9alais.e.s en mati\u00e8re de logements!

The timber export market is in steep decline, especially in the United States where housing starts have slowed and timber prices have dropped, said Donaldson.\n\"From November to the end of February, we were averaging over $400 for 1,000 board feet for lumber exports to the U.S. and now, checking today, we're about $319 for 1,000 board feet,\" Donaldson said at a news conference. \"That's a significant drop in a short period of time.\"\nBut he said if export markets start to rebound, many of the curtailed mills can start up operations. Donaldson said the three-month stumpage payment reprieve can help companies endure until markets improve.\nStumpage is the fee forest operators pay the province to harvest, buy or sell trees from Crown land.\n\"The deferral, with interest, will leave eligible companies with an estimated $80 million in the short term, so they can pay employees, pay contractors and pay other bills,' Donaldson said. \"In conversations with the sector, a stumpage deferral was a primary request to support the industry and provide relief.\"\nThe Council of Forest Industries, which represents the majority of B.C.'s lumber and pulp producers, said the announcement will help the industry during the pandemic.\n\"The deferral of stumpage fees is an important short-term measure to help alleviate some of the unprecedented financial pressure brought on by the COVID-19 crisis,\" council president Susan Yurkovich said in a statement. \"It will help B.C.'s forest companies put people back to work in communities, as markets come back and we move towards economic recovery.\"\nDonaldson said the deferral may help some companies get back to work sooner and could save other firms from shutting down completely.\nHe said he was confident the initiative would withstand possible challenges from the U.S. lumber lobby under the Canada-U.S. softwood agreement.

Combined with a pledge to cut fees by 10 per cent, the Liberals estimated the measures would cost $535 million a year.\nThe presentation can be seen as making a case for more government action in areas where costs are determined by public policy \u2014 unlike prices for things like clothes and gasoline, which are market-driven, said David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.\n\"In that sense, affordability isn't something the market can help with. Instead of getting government out of the way, we need to get it in the way of rising costs for Canadians,\" said Macdonald, who studies the cost of child care in Canada.\nMacdonald co-wrote a report in 2017 that surveyed child care costs across the country. Although prices depend on the age of the child, spaces cost about $1,000 a month on average.\nBut the variation was huge among provinces: in Quebec, where the government subsidizes child care very heavily, median fees were under $200 a month; in Toronto, a space for a pre-schooler cost $1,212 a month, and one for an infant was $1,758 a month.\nThere are also expectations the budget will increase the value of the Canada Child Benefit for children under age one, a pledge the parliamentary budget officer estimated would cost $252 million in its first year.\nGarima Talwar Kapoor, policy and research director at Maytree, an anti-poverty foundation, said child benefits are critical to increasing family incomes, but it is less clear how much they address child care costs.\n\"If I were in government and were trying to address the child care affordability challenges that families face, I'd ask whether further investments in child benefits ... alleviate child care concerns, or whether systemic responses to child care spaces are needed,\" she said.\nInflation in housing costs has stayed just behind median wage growth, helped by \"downward pressures from falling interest rates\" that have lowered the cost of ownership, the presentation said.\nCosts remain high in many cities owing to a shortage of places to buy or rent, though.\nFinance officials calculated Toronto is the most unaffordable city in Canada, followed closely by Vancouver, in an analysis that compared average weekly wages in 12 cities once adjusting for the cost of living in each place.\nElsewhere in the country, there are \"uncertain and regional effects of policy response on jobs and cost of living\" when it comes to the federal approach to environmental concerns.\nLooking ahead, about one-quarter of people nearing retirement might not have enough money to pay for their golden years, notably those without workplace pension plans, the document said. Meanwhile, even the expanded Canada Pension Plan may not \"fully offset the decline in private pension coverage, leaving workers more exposed to risk.\"\nIf people aren't saving on their own for retirements, that might eventually reduce tax revenues coming into the federal treasury and increase money going out through old-age security payments, said Jennifer Robson, an associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa. That would be tough on the federal budget.\nShe said it's not clear whether an expansion of the Canada Pension Plan \u2014 by raising benefit amounts but also premiums over time \u2014 will be enough.\n\"Government can actually do quite a lot for people at the bottom end who don't have pensions,\" Robson said, \"but the ones that they tend to think about are the ones in the middle.\"\n"}, {"author": "Drew Anderson", "title": "Housing homeless in hotels would take too long due to suicide prevention retrofits: minister", "description": "Rajan Sawhney says overflow shelter spaces like Telus Convention Centre was the fast pandemic response", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/housing-homeless-hotels-calgary-1.5516736", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5516754.1585691500!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/telus-convention-centre-shelter.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 31, 2020 4:01 PM MT", "2020-03-31T22:01:08.151Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Alberta's minister of community and social services says placing homeless Calgarians in hotels rather than larger facilities is problematic because the hotel option is too slow given the need for suicide prevention retrofits.\n\"Getting hotels ready does take a\u00a0lot of time because hotels do need to be retrofitted,\" said Rajan Sawhney.\u00a0\n\"When you're dealing with vulnerable clients, you have to make sure that you have suicide prevention measures in place.

But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of Discovery\u00a0Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit.\nKutarna\u00a0worries that Statistics Canada's\u00a0plan\u00a0to plunge into the ocean\u00a0of \"Big Data\" so\u00a0beloved of\u00a0retailers and credit card companies \u2014 described last week by chief statistician Anil Arora\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.\u00a0\n\"One of the\u00a0terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,\" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England.\nFor example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door on\u00a0values such as family, respect, happiness and species\u00a0extinction.\n\"There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,\" said Kutarna.\nOne practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people.\nIn a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it.\nPoloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow that\u00a0computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP is\u00a0being understated by as much as two\u00a0per cent.\nOne example he offered was the\u00a0way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item.\n\"How does StatCan deal with that?\" asked Poloz.\nLast week,\u00a0Arora\u00a0boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledges\u00a0it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding of\u00a0how the world works.\n\"Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,\" said Arora in an interview.\nThe statistics chief calls it a \"team sport\" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured should\u00a0be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible.\n\"This is always going to be a journey,\" said Arora, adding\u00a0that finding and incorporating into our figures\u00a0what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.\u00a0\nPart of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, those\u00a0traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internet\u00a0from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.\u00a0\n\"Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and we\u00a0have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,\" said Arora\u00a0in his speech.\nWhen it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date.\nArora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of Wellbeing\u00a0includes 200 indicators \u2014 from crime and safety to sustainable growth \u2014 most of which come from Statistics Canada data. But it's GDP that gets the attention.\nStatisticians are always groping to find the data sets that matter. But even in areas we think we know and understand, statistics are merely an indicator \u2014 an estimate, of reality. Things we don't understand are, by definition, even harder to measure.\n\"We live in this culture where what is real is what we measure,\" said\u00a0Kutarna, \"That\u00a0the things we measure are reality.\"\nIn which case, a certain amount of healthy skepticism, whether\u00a0about this week's inflation numbers,\u00a0about GDP, productivity or the many other financial statistics that are often offered as solid immutable facts, may well be in order.\u00a0\u00a0\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/daybreaknorth/fear-and-frustration-main-emotions-at-forum-on-seniors-housing-shortage-in-prince-george-1.5343201", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Councillor pushes for micro-structure homeless solution", "description": "A request for a Conestoga Hut pilot project will be put forward to a city committee today", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/councillor-pushes-for-micro-structure-homeless-solution-1.5467182", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5467575.1582059330!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/conestoga-huts.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-02-19T10:00:00.397Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Coun. Michael van Holst is continuing his pursuit of a homeless transition solution, this time pitching the idea of a\u00a0\u00a0number of Conestoga Huts, micro-structures that resemble a covered wagon, to house people who don't have another place to live.\u00a0\nA larger-scale proposal by the councillor that included a community tent was quashed\u00a0by city staff last month\u00a0and now he's asking for a\u00a0smaller pilot project.\nThe Ward 1 councillor put forward the idea at the Jan. 21 meeting of the Community and Protective Services Committee (CAPS) meeting, putting forward a list of transitional housing options.\n\"There's many ways people can move from a shelter or sleeping in the rough to their own apartment and I think it's worthwhile for us to recognize that having a bunch of those in place might be valuable,\" said van Holst.\nConestoga Huts are\u00a0small structures that are about 5.5 square metres, look like a covered wagon and cost about $1,000 to build. Beyond a small front porch is a locking front door, room for a bed and storage, along with a rear window. Each hut would be numbered to allow occupants to have a mailing address.\nThe initial pitch also included providing housing near an area where residents can grow food, a large temporary structure that could house people but also double as a mess hall, community centre and workshop with Conestoga Huts nearby, and\u00a0a campground-style area where tents could be erected with small fences around them. The total price tag was estimated to be less than $3 million.\nStaff who work on\u00a0homeless prevention asked\u00a0people who experience homelessness\u00a0about the idea, but the response was warm at best.\n\"We've not seen anybody express an interest specifically in the Conestoga Hut,\" said Craig Cooper, manager of homeless prevention at the City of London. \"We do have some individuals that sort of forage or live in vehicles or sheds on peoples' property, things like that, so the Conestoga Hut model might work for some of those individuals.\"\nCooper said they mostly see people who are looking for long-term permanent housing.\n\"We do look at different forms and options of housing and recognize that shelters and transition rooms aren't for everybody,\" he said.\n\"So we do look at different models of housing, but the ones that are transitional, they're shorter term and they might be that stepping stone that somebody might need in that moment\u00a0to get to a more permanent housing situation.\"\u00a0\nIn a letter to CAPS, van Holst, along with Coun. Shawn Lewis, noted that they heard there were five homeless individuals who considered lodging in Conestoga Huts. They're asking for staff to produce a report with a plan to pilot a small number of Conestoga Huts.\nIf given the green light by councillors, the\u00a0report would be submitted to the committee on Apr. 28.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Housing group wants city to license landlords", "description": "Renters, neighbours, landlords asked to fill out survey by Sept. 4.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-rental-accommodation-study-survey-1.5261705", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3348795.1449156434!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/refugee-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 29, 2019 9:01 AM ET", "2019-08-29T13:02:52.361Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "An advocacy group for low-income tenants is urging the City of Ottawa\u00a0to crack down on shabby living conditions by licensing landlords, but landlords say that will just worsen the capital's rental housing crunch.\nThe city plans to come up with\u00a0new\u00a0rules this fall that could affect all\u00a0private\u00a0rental properties, from traditional apartments and rooming houses to student housing and short-term rentals like Airbnb.\nMembers of the advocacy group Acorn Ottawa have been going to public meetings to argue people shouldn't have to live with bed bugs, cockroaches or unresponsive landlords.\nAcorn's\u00a0solution is to license all landlords who own more than three units, and subject them to regular city\u00a0inspections.\n\"Bad landlords don't exist in just one area, or a couple of areas. They're throughout the city,\" said Acorn's Blaine Cameron.\nBut the Eastern Ontario Landlords Organization\u00a0says\u00a0the city simply needs to better enforce the bylaws it already has,\u00a0and target the\u00a0few problematic buildings for which it regularly gets\u00a0noise and property\u00a0complaints.\n\"Let's address those problems. Let's not bring in all kinds of regulations and\u00a0all kinds of cost and bother to the 95 per cent of landlords who behave\u00a0well and are maintaining their buildings well,\" said its chair John Dickie.\nBroad licensing\u00a0of landlords would be counterproductive, he added.\n\"It would discourage people from renting out units, which at this point, that's the last thing that should be done,\" said Dickie.\nAn\u00a0analysis of the rental market for the City of Ottawa describes how rents rose\u00a0sharply between 2016 and 2018, and the 1,123\u00a0new units that came on the market in that time couldn't keep up with 5,388 more renters.\nThe affordability\u00a0and supply of rental housing are\u00a0big issues but are more likely to be dealt with through the new official plan and homelessness strategy.\nMaclaren\u00a0Municipal Consulting, which the city hired\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0stock of Ottawa's wide-ranging rental issues, offered the city more policy choices to deal with housing conditions\u00a0in a report this month.\nToronto, for instance, has a registry of large apartment buildings and requires them to deal with pests. Oshawa actually licenses rental housing, but only near its post-secondary campuses.\nAnother option would be to have bylaw officers write tickets when they see an\u00a0unkempt property, the same way they write parking tickets, instead of only following up on\u00a0complaints.\nResidents have until Sept. 4 to fill out a survey\u00a0with their feedback, which will feed into what regulations or enforcement staff recommend to\u00a0city councillors this fall.

That's all we have to do,\" said\u00a0Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, a point he has repeated since being elected in 2018.\u00a0\nStewart argued it wasn't a given that the region would continue to be the worst in Canada for\u00a0rental prices, but said it was incumbent on some of Metro Vancouver's 20 other municipalities to approve more new rental buildings.\u00a0\n\"We have about 25 percent of the population, but we're providing 40 percent of the rental housing. So I would hope that other municipalities would kind of pick it up a little bit,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut not every municipality takes the same philosophy as Stewart.\n\"There's different attitudes across the region toward housing,\" said North Vancouver District councillor Mathew Bond.\u00a0\nLess than five per cent of housing starts in 2019 in the district were dedicated to rental in 2019, and a majority of councillors\u00a0in 2018 were elected on a platform of slowing down growth.\u00a0\n\"Right now I think we're in a bit of a holding pattern,\" said Bond, adding that it was important to remember that the entire region\u00a0went decades without approving much new rental.\u00a0\n\"It's going to take more than a few approvals every few years to get out of this problem.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Housing sales down in August across Hamilton-Burlington", "description": "But year-to-date sales still up due to a 'strong spring'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/housing-sales-down-in-august-across-hamilton-burlington-1.5269650", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5119539.1556766415!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 04, 2019 9:15 AM ET", "2019-09-04T13:29:01.292Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "According to the Realtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington (RAHB), home sales are down from June and July,\u00a0and also down compared to August 2018.\u00a0\nThe association, which represents realtors, reported\u00a01,067 sales throughout August.

Further details weren't immediately available since the federal government will have to co-ordinate with provinces on the program.\nLandlords, meanwhile, have generally offered short-term rent deferrals on an ad-hoc basis, but Bushe says she wants to see landlords share more of the burden that the mandated shutdowns have forced on the economy.\n\"It's all kind of coming down on our backs ... you can't push the debt down to the bottom (group) that have the least liquidity and not expect other players, mid-level players and large players, to really do their part.\"\nBushe said she's asked her landlord, Metrus Properties, for some level of rent forgiveness to share the burden. The company has so far offered a one-month rent deferral, with interest of prime plus one per cent on the unpaid rent over the rest of the lease term.\nMetrus did not respond to a request for comment.\nTaking a deferral would mean Bushe takes on further debt at a time when there's no clear picture of when the store will open, and what the economy will look like when that happens.\n\"No one imagines the economy is going to come roaring back,\" she said. \"And the money that you lose as you're closed, that money's lost for your year. It's very hard to make it up again.\"\nA recently formed campaign called Save Small Business proposes that the federal government would compensate landlords for two-thirds of whatever rent discounts they give tenants for three months, so if a landlord cuts a tenant's rent by $5,000 a month then the government would pay the landlord $3,300. The group suggests capping the payments at $6,000 a month and only offer it to tenants with less than $5 million in annual revenue.\nThe coalition says that its key criteria for any program are that it is rolled out fast, has broad eligibility, isn't based on deferrals or debt, and national.\nCIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal has also called for direct government support for small businesses to avoid more job losses.\n\"Some sort of rent solution is essential to increase the effectiveness of other programs and limit the pace of increase in the unemployment rate,\" he said in a note earlier this week.\nTal proposed the federal government follow a model put forward by the Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario, where tenants pay what they can and then the government pays the rest. The government then recoups the payments from tenants later on.\n\"That cost-sharing approach towards rent payment would go a long way to ease the financial pressure facing commercial tenants,\" he said.\nWhile Thursday's announcement from federal government promises more support, its main relief programs so far are a $40,000 interest-free loan and 75 per cent wage subsidies, though it has also called on landlords to be accommodating.\n\"We continue to call on landlords to exercise compassion and refrain from evictions during this difficult time for businesses and all Canadians,\" said Ryan Nearing, press secretary to Small Business Minister Mary Ng.\nHe said earlier this week that both Ng and Finance Minister Bill Morneau are listening to small business owners and entrepreneurs and that they \"continue to explore options to provide support in these unprecedented times.\"\nThe response so far contrasts with some other advanced economies such as Australia's model, which has put a hold on commercial evictions and mandated that rents be reduced based on tenant's decline in turnover \"to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants.\"\nWhile there have been few cases of outright rent reductions from large landlords in Canada, some have shown more flexibility on terms.\nAleem Jima of Premier Eye Care in Calgary said that his landlord, Brookfield Asset Management, has offered a three-month rent deferral on base rent, and while he still has to pay operating costs, the base rent can be paid back over five years starting in January with a slight added per square foot payment.\nJima said he was grateful for the way they had structured the repayment, and that it contrasts with public offers from several commercial landlords offering a two-month rent deferral that must be repaid within a year.\nBrookfield did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther businesses are still working through negotiations with landlords, and trying to push alternative arrangements.\nMark Scantlebury, CEO of Extreme Telematics Corp. in Calgary, said the company is getting hit with both the oil price and the direct pandemic shutdowns.\nSince the company will be under financial pressure for months, Scantlebury is pushing for a longer-term payback or other arrangements that could hopefully satisfy the landlord, such as paying half-rent for a year and then making it up later to ease the immediate shock, while still giving the landlord cash flow.\n\"So you still are getting some money and covering off your cost, and we get half rent for double the period.

But even now, with rare exceptions, predictions for the economy range from moderately gloomy to what may be wishful thinking.\nThe often-bleak David Rosenberg, who now runs his own independent research company, concedes U.S. Federal Reserve's\u00a0massive cash injection may avert an economic depression. For Rosenberg, that's positively cheery.\nThe current index of economic policy uncertainty is like nothing we have ever seen before and we have to say that in a strong sense: not like 2008, not like 9/11, not like 1997/8 or 87. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SoberLook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SoberLook</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jI162Fm0hn\">pic.twitter.com/jI162Fm0hn</a>\nBut uncertainty remains extraordinarily high and with such a range of views each of us must either pick among the forecasts or make up our own. With that in mind, here are a few considerations to help you think about what the future may hold.\nWhile a new round of emergency rate cuts, income support and mortgage deferment plans should help heavily indebted Canadians from hitting rock bottom, it is inevitable that many will go further into the hole. There are reports that credit card companies are already worried as consumers are using plastic to replace lost income.\nAll that raises questions about whether, once the illness is past, consumers can resume their role as debt-fuelled motors of the North American economy. Meanwhile, governments are accumulating\u00a0massive new debts of their own. Highly leveraged businesses also face strain.\nOverall, recessions hurt people, but some economic theory says that capitalism actually needs periodic downturns to refresh itself through creative destruction. Weak \"zombie\" businesses and sunset industries are finally killed off, clearing the way for healthier, younger or more efficient firms, making the whole economy stronger in the aftermath. But the adjustment process is far from instant and can be painful for displaced workers.\nOne of the recent bright spots in the economy has been low unemployment, but a sharp rise in U.S. jobless claims made headlines last week, and this week's upcoming U.S. job numbers will tell us more. Canada's come on the Thursday before Easter.\nTravel restrictions have already stopped immigration and despite objections from refugee advocates, the border has also closed to asylum seekers. Restrictions of weeks or months will lead to a backlog of immigration cases and as the economy works through its recovery, governments may face pressure to limit the total flow of immigrants.\nOne reason for real estate fears in Alberta is that few parts of the Canadian economy have been as battered by the COVID-19 crisis as the oil and gas sector, where the cost of a barrel of oil sands crude has fallen below price for the\u00a0Barrel of Monkeys childrens' game. Despite low gasoline prices partly caused by a global price war led by Saudi Arabia, sales have plummeted as people stay home. Storage capacity has reached its limits meaning that even with federal and provincial help producers are shutting down. For incurable optimists, one positive effect could be the redirection of investment toward diversification.\u00a0\nIt seems almost certain that as low prices slow exploration and drive some producers out of business, oil prices will bounce back. Of course, the question is when. Spending on COVID-19 testing may yield surprising results as they did in places like Singapore. It is also almost certain that as soon as they are released, commerce-starved shut-ins who do have money to shop will rush out to spend it on goods and services. That one-time burst of spending could act in a similar way to Keynesian stimulation, kick-starting the economy and sending businesses that have survived to new heights. In post-war kind of mood, perhaps we will experience post-war solidarity and goodwill based on shared experience to help solve our economic problems. And while some doubt it, another lingering effect may be a baby boom from couples who were just looking for a way to keep busy.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Maryse Zeidler", "title": "Renter who listed spare room on Airbnb ordered to repay roommate's damage deposit", "description": "B.C.

But when Antaya\u00a0moved out, her roommate\u00a0refused to refund her $400 damage deposit.\nThe B.C. Civil Resolution Tribunal\u00a0recently ordered Wutzke to repay it,\u00a0plus interest and the $125 filing fee.\u00a0\nAntaya says she learned\u00a0that in B.C., roommates not listed on a lease are considered occupants and have no rights under the Residential Tenancy Act, which sets baseline rules for agreements between tenants and landlords in the province.\u00a0\nRobert Patterson, a staff member at the B.C. Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre (TRAC), says many people, trying to save money by living with roommates aren't aware of this.\nFor that reason, Patterson said it's important for people to put an\u00a0agreement in writing.\u00a0\nAntaya says that could be useful, but she would prefer if the Residential Tenancy Act were updated to better reflect the current housing market.\n\"At least have some policies in place where occupants can go through the same motions as tenants,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWutzke, a social work student\u00a0who now lives in Prince George, refused to comment on the decision\u00a0but said she was \"furious\" about it.\u00a0\nAntaya moved into the\u00a0three-bedroom apartment near Main Street and 41st Avenue with Wutzke and another roommate in April 2019.\nShe has a fulltime\u00a0government job as an administrative assistant, but\u00a0says living with roommates is all she can afford in Vancouver.\u00a0\nAntaya says she had found the apartment on Craigslist.\u00a0Wutzke\u00a0and the other roommate seemed nice. There were no red flags.\nAccording to the tribunal decision, another person soon replaced the third roommate\u00a0but left\u00a0shortly afterwards.\u00a0Wutzke\u00a0told the tribunal she decided to make up for the\u00a0shortfall in rent by listing that room for short-term rentals on Airbnb.\nAs the only person on the lease, Wutzke would have been the sole person legally responsible for paying rent. Lease holders have legal rights under the\u00a0Residential Tenancy Act, but they also have responsibilities that roommates, or occupants, typically don't.\nAntaya\u00a0and Wutzke\u00a0clashed about whether Antaya\u00a0had agreed to the Airbnb scenario, and whether she had cleaned her room upon moving out.\nThe tribunal decided that the Airbnb guests violated the agreement between the two roommates, and Antaya's photo and video evidence proved she had\u00a0cleaned the room.\u00a0\nPatterson, of TRAC, said\u00a0Antaya's case points to the complications that can arise between roommates.\u00a0\nAntaya was lucky to be able to take her complaint to the Civil Resolution Tribunal, which resolves small claims less than $5,000. But he says non-monetary issues like evictions have to go to B.C. Supreme Court, which can be lengthy and expensive.\u00a0\nRoommates were covered under the Residential Tenancy Act until about five years ago, Patterson says, but that also posed challenges because it wasn't clear if one roommate could make changes to the lease\u00a0or if everyone had to be in agreement.\nHaving all roommates listed on a lease also poses challenges, Patterson says. A\u00a0new tenancy agreement has to be rewritten every time someone moves out, he says,\u00a0which opens the door to rent increases above the allowable 2.5 per cent.\nIn the absence of any rights, Patterson advises taking the time to come up with a detailed agreement between roommates.\n\"At the beginning of any kind of living scenario everyone is assuming that things are going to go well,\" he said. \"Be imaginative in terms of what issues you think could come up.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Paula Duhatschek", "title": "'The system isn't working': Kitchener housing report raises red flags on affordability", "description": "Data gaps on housing speculation, 'renovictions' also highlighted", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/kitchener-housing-report-2020-1.5421163", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5421231.1578603399!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/condo-kitchener.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 13, 2020 5:50 AM ET", "2020-01-13T10:50:00.593Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A new report going before a Kitchener committee Monday says home ownership\u00a0is becoming unaffordable for all but the city's highest earners.\nThe report says\u00a0rents increased by an average of 35 per cent while average housing prices increased by a whopping 88 per cent during the decade between 2008 and 2018.\nMost of those cost increases happened since 2016, the report said.\n\"Only a third of the people in the city of Kitchener can afford to purchase what is now the average resale house in the city,\" said Karen Cooper, the city's manager of strategic and business planning.\nThe end result is that people who could have previously moved from a rental apartment into a family home are now staying where they are, she said.\nThat in turn leads to higher rental prices, which Cooper said can also contribute\u00a0to rising homelessness.\nCooper said the uptick in housing prices is caused by a variety of factors:\nAlthough many of those factors are generally thought to be positive, they also contribute to an increase in housing costs.\n\"You see these results coming out for people not being able to afford to buy,\u00a0not being able to afford to rent,\" said Cooper.\n\"That's why we say in the report that the system\u00a0isn't working.\"\nSandra Robertson, 72, said she feels she's \"in the safest place in the world\" living in affordable housing, but said she worries about young people trying to make ends meet.

Instead, verbal briefings were the standard. (With the notable exception of Jerome Kennedy, personal note-taking was also not common.)\u00a0\nThese were people who were charged with making decisions \u2014 critical decisions, with billions of dollars at stake \u2014 and yet some were not as prepared as one might assume, or expect.\nWe don't know what lessons are being learned at Confederation Building, but it did seem striking, then, that Premier Dwight Ball\u00a0and Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady assembled the media Tuesday to release the Muskrat Falls commission's final report, without giving journalists so much as a few minutes to read it first.\u00a0\nThis may not strike many readers as particularly unusual, but it is. On budget day, for instance, reporters have several hours to sift through a collection of documents to makes sense of it, while also being able to ask technical questions of experts. (More and more, however, journalists covering the budget are doing this while a cascade of politicians come before them to spin what they want the coverage to be about.)\nTechnical briefings are also common when, say, a new government policy is unveiled, or something like a new report on crab stocks. DFO did one of those just last week.\nWith the damning Muskrat Falls report, though, that kind of prepared rollout of information did not happen.\u00a0Instead, journalists were given a report that is highly complex, and which takes time to digest, while two politicians made verbal comments ahead of their reading. Right away, Ball and Coady set the narrative \u2014 noting, in particular, that the matter was being referred to the police.\nNo surprise, then, that this comment was a highlight of media coverage on announcement day. It's a classic bit of political framing.\nThe report itself (you can read all six volumes here) is captivating, sobering reading (as of this writing, I'm still reading it), and not at all likely to soothe the nerves of anyone nervous about Newfoundland and Labrador's economic future.\nMuskrat Falls is entwined with a dismal and worsening fiscal picture for the provincial treasury.\nThe latest report from the auditor general's office, in December, put the government's net debt at $15.4 billion. Julia Mullaley, who just this week moved from the auditor general's office to run Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corp., noted that works out to $29,250 per person, a new record high.\nIt's not just Muskrat Falls that has been racking up the debt. For every single year for the last seven years, we've been putting more debt on the proverbial provincial credit card. Those consecutive deficits add up to $6.4 billion of extra debt.\nMullaley's last report came out just a week after a delayed provincial fiscal update that revealed\u00a0government revenues had fallen sharply, to the tune of an extra $392 million.\n\"Dumpster fire\" is a metaphor that's being used frequently to describe the state of things with the government's finances.\nWhat's concerning is that latest news about the current shortfall and the cumulative debt were both revealed before two crises that emerged in the new year: a collapse in oil prices and COVID-19.\nJudge determines $12.7-billion dollar hydro mega-project was a misguided mistake; oil slightly above $35.00 per barrel; schools run out of hand sanitizer\u2026 and we might be headed to the polls before July. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nlpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ukD2qRyNKU\">pic.twitter.com/ukD2qRyNKU</a>\nThey're not unrelated, although the cliff-like drop in oil prices involves OPEC and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. (If you ever want to get a sense of how comparatively insignificant N.L.'s production is, reading about games that oil giants play will do the trick.)\nThe day before the Muskrat Falls commission report was released, oil prices took their single biggest jump since the Gulf War.\nThe day after the report was released, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. There were signposts of the impact of the novel coronavirus everywhere: all of Italy basically shuts down, Dublin cancels its St. Patrick's celebration, the NBA suspends its season, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson are diagnosed \u2026 the list goes on.\nAs for oil prices \u2026 well, now. The downward pressure on oil is inextricably linked to the roaring bear that has dominated the stock market for the last three weeks, culminating in what's already been tagged as \"Black Monday\" earlier this week: the biggest single-day drop since the 2008 banking crisis.\nBrent crude, the type of oil that Newfoundland and Labrador uses for budgeting purposes, dropped like a rock going over a cliff. In last April's budget, the government picked $65 as the average price per barrel of Brent crude. (The December update knocked that down to $63.20.)\nWhat will this year's budget put oil at?\nWell \u2026 we're not going to know for a while. The governing Liberals are focused now on electing a new leader, and we won't know whether it will be Andrew Furey or John Abbott until May 9. The budget was pushed back until a new leader, premier and possibly cabinet are in place.\nGiven how many things are being cancelled this week, maybe that's not entirely a bad thing.\nBut in an alley full of dumpster fires, it feels odd that we don't have a plan, at least for now, on how to handle a cluster of crises.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Feds, Ontario commit $1.4B for affordable housing for low-income families", "description": "Investment is set to run from 2020-2028 with each family receiving about $2,500", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/housing-announcement-toronto-1.5402103", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5358330.1573674993!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cranes-front-spadina.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 19, 2019 8:33 AM ET", "2019-12-19T16:27:02.314Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal and provincial governments say they will be investing a combined $1.4 billion in a bid to help low-income families in Ontario with housing costs.\nRepresentatives from both governments, as well as city officials, were on hand in the east end of Toronto Thursday morning to make the announcement.\nAccording to a news release, money will be provided directly to families through the Canada Housing Benefit.\u00a0\nThe money will be distributed to families who have been identified by the provincial government as being in need, including domestic violence survivors, seniors, people with disabilities, and Indigenous communities.\u00a0\nThose families are already predetermined by the provincial government, said Stephen Clark, Ontario's minister of municipal affairs and housing.\nThe investment is set to run from 2020-2028 with each family receiving about $2,500 but that number is subject to change based on individual needs.\u00a0\nClark also confirmed the families are free to decide how they use the money.\u00a0\n\"We're giving people more flexibility and more choice,\" he said.\u00a0\nOntario is the first province to work with the federal\u00a0government on this project.\nThe move is part of a larger federal commitment that will see Ottawa work with all of the provinces and territories to help low-income Canadians find suitable homes.\nThe commitment is likely welcome news in Toronto, a city dealing with sky-high purchase prices, an extreme shortage of rental units and crumbling social housing.\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Omstead", "title": "Habitat for Humanity residents given temporary reprieve during pandemic, court battle continues", "description": "'It was a relief for everybody.

But the charity's lawyers turned down the request as recently as Tuesday, Nanda said.\nThe families then shared a statement with CBC News on Wednesday morning, urging the charity to change their position.\u00a0\n\"We actually don't know what to do or where to go since some of us are laid off and our kids are at home. We are very concerned about the situation Habitat is making us go through,\" the statement read.\u00a0\nWhen asked for comment on Wednesday, CEO Karen Stone said Habitat for Humanity Edmonton would not jeopardize the health and safety of the partner families during the public health crisis.\u00a0\n\"To provide certainty and peace of mind to those involved in the ongoing litigation, we will be extending their tenancy agreements for at least three months and will continue to offer mediation services in hopes of reaching an amicable resolution to retain all families within our program,\" the statement read.\u00a0\nThe charity will consider further extensions as the situation evolves, the statement continued.\u00a0\nThe statement was posted to the charity's website later Wednesday afternoon. Adja Barry says it was the first guarantee her family, including three young children, would have a home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"It was a relief for everybody. At least we can just focus on one thing now: our kids,\" she said.\u00a0\nBarry and her husband are among the families who say they were promised a zero-interest mortgage, not exceeding 25 per cent of their income, to move into Carter Place. In exchange, they agreed to 500 volunteer hours of work, or what the charity calls \"sweat equity,\" in part to build the home.\u00a0\nLow-income\u00a0families otherwise unable to obtain a bank mortgage could leverage the program to build equity and then purchase a home on the market.\u00a0\n\"The Housing Scheme seemed like a God-send, providing us stable housing that we could call our own,\" Barry said in a signed affidavit.\u00a0\nBut Habitat Edmonton is in financial trouble, reporting nearly $28 million in liabilities in their 2018 annual report. In an interview with CBC News last year, Stone said the charity merged staff positions and laid off seven full-time workers, but still further action needed to be taken.\u00a0\nIn November, Barry got a notice from Habitat. The current interest-free agreement between her family and the charity was ending. She could either sign a new mortgage scheme or withdraw from the program. \u00a0\nUnder the new scheme, half of the purchase price of the home would now be financed by Servus Credit Union. There was no guarantee the credit union would approve every family's lending application, and no guarantee the mortgage payments would stay below 25 per cent of their income.\u00a0\nBarry estimates her family would pay $17,000 in interest over five years under the new model, if their lending application was approved.\u00a0\nNone of the allegations have been proven in court.\u00a0\nThe charity has pushed the tenancy agreement back three times since that first notice, including the latest extension to cover the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBarry says she is skeptical the charity would have provided the extension if the families had not gone public with their concerns.\u00a0\nBut\u00a0Stone says the charity had always intended to offer an extension \u2014 once the injunction request was settled in court\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and had communicated as much to the group's lawyer, Nanda, on multiple occasions.\u00a0\n\"We remain hopeful and optimistic that these families will come to realize the significant benefits of the new mortgage model that we are offering them and that they will return to the program of affordable home ownership,\" she said.\u00a0\nNanda\u00a0denied the charity ever offered to extend the agreement. Rather, he says the charity told him it may take weeks or months for the charity to find other families to participate in the revised program, and the current occupants could potentially benefit from that intervening period.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Wallis Snowdon", "title": "Most evacuation orders lifted as Fort McMurray floodwaters recede", "description": "Mayor says warm temperatures helping to thaw massive ice jams faster than expected", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-flood-wood-buffalo-alberta-don-scott-1.5552281", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5548946.1588609852!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mcmurray-aviation-flooding.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 01, 2020 10:25 AM MT", "2020-05-04T04:55:39.719Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As floodwaters continue to recede in Fort McMurray, Alta., most\u00a0evacuees will be allowed to return home Friday,\u00a0but the municipality is warning residents to be prepared for potential property damage.\u00a0\nSome mandatory evacuation orders in place since flooding were lifted at\u00a02 p.m. MT, while almost all others were lifted at 8 p.m.,\u00a0the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo said in a news release.\u00a0The only remaining evacuation order is for\u00a0Draper, a community 12 kilometres south of downtown Fort McMurray.\u00a0\nAs of 8 p.m. mandatory evacuation orders will be lifted for the following areas:\nResidents and business owners can access their properties\u00a0without restriction but should exercise caution, the municipality said. Structures in these areas may have internal damage.\nUtilities\u00a0such as gas, electricity and water\u00a0have not been restored\u00a0fully\u00a0at this time, municipal officials said.\u00a0A boil water advisory remains in effect across the region\u00a0and cases of water will be available to residents at the Peter Pond Mall parking lot.\u00a0\nResidents must not attempt to enter the area prior to 8 p.m.\u00a0The municipality is also discouraging drivers\u00a0from creating lineups on Highway 63.\nThe return of residents to the downtown core is coming sooner than initially anticipated.\u00a0\nOn Thursday, municipal officials estimated\u00a0it would take a week at least before nearly 13,000 evacuees would be allowed back into the flood zone.\nDon Scott,\u00a0mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, said warm temperatures are helping to thaw massive ice jams faster than expected.\n\"We're very pleased with the progress we've made today,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday afternoon.\n\"I'm expecting we're going to make a lot more progress in the hours to come as well.\"\nScott said water level in local rivers continued to drop rapidly on\u00a0Friday.\n\"The ice has dropped considerably,\" he said. \"The water table has dropped. Our municipal infrastructure can now drain out. There is real progress being made.\"\nThe Clearwater River \u2014 which overran its banks on Monday, flooding the downtown core\u00a0\u2014 dropped about a metre overnight, Scott said.\nA massive ice jam that initially stretched along 25 kilometres of the Athabasca River now measures about eight\u00a0kilometres and continues to melt rapidly.\nThe flooding began Sunday, when a 25-kilometre sheet of ice effectively dammed the Athabasca River, forcing the Clearwater to reverse course and flood the city's downtown core. An estimated 1,230 structures have been damaged.\u00a0\nWhile some areas remain swamped, images of the downtown Friday show floodwaters have receded significantly.\u00a0\nSome areas that were under a couple of metres of water, with abandoned cars completely submerged, now only have puddles of pooling water in the street.\u00a0\u00a0\nMunicipal officials had said a return to the flood zone will happen in stages. Essential businesses, including key government infrastructure, grocery stores, hardware stores, gas stations, hotels\u00a0and pharmacies will be given priority.\nBusinesses spared the worst of the flooding will be inspected and allowed to open first.\u00a0\nDamage assessment teams, consisting of building and safety codes inspectors, were deployed Thursday, the municipality said in a news release.\nOnce inspections are completed, operators will be able to return to their properties to assess damages\u00a0and begin the recovery process.\nSome homes, while accessible, may not be safe, cautioned Scott Davis, director of emergency services.\u00a0\nUtilities have not been fully restored. Sewage back-ups may have left permanent damage, and a boil water advisory remains in effect for much of the region.\nWATCH | Assessing the damage from Fort McMurray's floods:\nMunicipal crews do not have the capacity to inspect each property damaged by the floodwaters, Davis said.\u00a0\"Homes may not be safe to occupy and you may not be able to live in your home,\" he said.\n\"We're not able to do the assessments inside the home. We rely on the homeowner and the insurance company to make that determination.\"\nA virtual community townhall was held\u00a0Thursday to provide an update on the river breakup and flood. Environment Minister Jason\u00a0 Nixon said a number of provincial conditions must be met before evacuees can return.\n\"Those conditions include floodwater no longer being an imminent threat, the availability of critical infrastructure and essential services and hazards in the area being secured,\" he said.\n\"There is no question that the recovery process in this community will be lengthy.\"\nThe flooding comes as Fort McMurray is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn caused by crashing oil prices. A raging wildfire in May 2016 forced the evacuation of the entire city and destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings.\nScott said the people of Fort McMurray are resilient.\u00a0\n\"We've been through hard times, and I think every Canadian has seen us go through it, and we always bounce back and come right back out the other side as strong as ever,\" Scott said.\n\"We're going to do it this time as well, and we are feeling very optimistic, especially with the signs we're seeing today.\"\nAt a news conference Friday, Nixon said an ice jam on the Peace River 24 kilometres downstream of the community of Garden River has expanded by 20 kilometres to a total of 44 kilometres.\n\"The increased size of that ice jam, the combining of the ice jams in that area is certainly having an impact on Garden River, Nixon said.\n\"We know several thousand people\u00a0could be affected by flooding in Little Red River Cree Nation.\" A state of local emergency for the area was declared on Monday.\nBackflooding\u00a0in creeks and other areas has cut off road access to the east side of Garden River but no houses have been flooded, Nixon said.\nHe said 560 people have been evacuated\u00a0from Garden River and at least 400 of them need support finding shelter and food, he added. The provincial operations centre is working to get shelter and supplies to evacuees.\nResidents of Fox Lake, upstream of Garden River,\u00a0are also preparing to evacuate, Nixon said. That could involve the evacuation of as many as 6,000 more people, he said.\nAn evacuation order issued Sunday is still in effect for Fort Vermilion residents that reside east of 50th street, north of the golf course, River Road, and Boreal Housing.\nBut once the jam\u00a0moves again, the situation will become less dire, Nixon said.\n\"My understanding is most of those areas where it could hold up from that point on are not very populated areas. We'd still obviously want to protect infrastructure \u2014 roads or bridges in those areas \u2014 and we'll watch it closely.\n\"But the anticipation is when we can break it past this place, where\u00a0the ice can flow on out of here and we can finally move past this situation.\"\nScott Long, executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said the agency is working with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Fort Vermilion and Garden River, ensuring that evacuees have the supports they need.\n\"Dewatering is taking place, damage assessment teams are out,\" Long said. But he cautioned that there is no firm timeline for people to return home.\n\"We are well aware that people need to get back to their homes as quickly as possible but there are a number of steps to make sure that it's safe for them to do so.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jason Proctor", "title": "City of Vancouver asks for input on future of co-op housing as leases run out", "description": "City says 4 scenarios recognize key concerns expressed by co-op residents", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-co-op-housing-leases-1.5443497", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3723574.1531779592!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/seniors-on-a-bench.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 28, 2020 3:45 PM PT", "2020-01-28T23:45:36.760Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "With the end of dozens of leases on valuable public land looming, the City of Vancouver is asking for input on a series of scenarios aimed at settling the future of co-op housing communities.\nCity staff unveiled a discussion paper Tuesday outlining four potential ways of dealing with the 57 co-ops that provide 3,700 units of housing on city land in Vancouver.\nThe options vary from a basic renewal to redevelopment and\u00a0\u2014 in an option that officials admit is their least preferred scenario\u00a0\u2014 the end of a co-op's lease.\n\"We are going through an affordability crisis and we want to ensure that the people who are ... using public land are the ones who have demonstrated need,\"\u00a0said Gracen\u00a0Chungath, the city's director of strategic operations.\n\"It is in response to what the co-ops said and what the co-op sector said and the affordability crisis that we have come up with these proposals.\"\nHousing co-ops are organizations in which residents act as share-holding members of a body incorporated under the Cooperative Association Act.\nMost of B.C.'s housing co-ops are non-profit and provide rentals to residents of a variety of incomes, with higher income residents ultimately subsidizing the rents of lower income families.\nThey reached lease deals decades ago, long before the skyrocketing property values that have rendered the city unaffordable to many.\u00a0\nBut with those leases running out, residents have worried about rent increases and the pressure to develop land in some of the city's most valuable corridors\u00a0\u2014 like False Creek.\nAnd with the years remaining on their leases dwindling to single digits, some co-ops have also been unable to secure money needed for major capital expenditures on what are often aging buildings.\nThe city has grappled with the future of co-ops in recent years, with council passing a framework in 2017 to handle negotiations. But staff say they made lease offers to three co-ops in the wake of that proposal, only to see all three offers rejected because of pricing and terms of the lease.\nSandra Singh, general manager of arts, culture and community service, says the city has listened to the concerns of co-op boards in coming up with the new discussion paper\u00a0\u2014 particularly as they relate to autonomy.\n\"The right and ability of them to manage their membership and to have autonomy over who's in their community is really important to them, and we absolutely recognize that,\" she said.\n\"What we want to do is enable co-ops who have different income mixes to generate or have housing charges that are responsive to those members.\"\nAll four scenarios would call for a minimum of 15 per cent of units to be dedicated to low income housing. And the cost of ground rent allocated to each unit should not exceed 30 per cent of household income.\nIn most cases, the ground rent would inevitably be less than the market use for city-owned land, which means that the difference between the market value and the amount paid is considered a grant.\nThe first of the four co-op scenarios is the most basic, with the co-op paying ground rent discounted from market value according to \"moderate rental income assumptions.\"\nThe second would be tailored to the actual make-up of the co-op by providing additional grants from the city based on anonymous\u00a0figures detailing the actual income and living space of co-op members.\nThe third option would involve redevelopment to make the most effective use of land, primarily in situations where the buildings are at the end of their lives and the site has high economic redevelopment potential.\nThe city says it would work to protect co-op members during and after redevelopment.\nAnd the final scenario would see a co-op choose not to renew,\u00a0in which case, the city would work to find a new non-profit operator for the building and give co-op members the option to stay in their homes.\nRetired librarian Nancy Hammum, who is chair of a co-op working group in False Creek South, says she is encouraged to see the city engaged in the process\u00a0but said the import of all scenarios will lie in the details.\nShe said co-op members are facing the same struggles as many Vancouverites.\n\"We're incredibly aware of millennials\u00a0and our own children \u2014\u00a0who have to pay higher prices if they don't\u00a0live in a co-op,\" Hannum said.\n\"We are supporting affordable\u00a0housing and we'll do what we can to make it work. We just don't want to be clobbered with over-densification and ignoring the existing community.\"\nConsultation on the proposals will close on March 24.

Other social assistance rates will stay the same.\nDespite the positive increases, advocates for\u00a0poor people in New Brunswick say the gap is still too large.\nRandy Hatfield of the Human Development Council in Saint John said\u00a0the five per cent increase was needed, but\u00a0over the past six years social assistance incomes have been eroded by inflation of 11.1 per cent, leaving people on low incomes with less and less money in their pockets.\n\"For a single person considered employable, the amount of welfare income they received before this announcement was only 39 per cent of the poverty line,\" said Hatfield.\nJean-Claude Basque of the Common Front for Social Justice said the five per cent increase doesn't go far enough in helping combat poverty in New Brunswick.\n\"This budget won't change a lot of situations, because the increases proposed are too low,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Even the poverty reduction plan that came out last week is not going far enough.

Like other sectors of Canadian real estate, the sudden economic downturn will expose faults in a rental market dependent on high levels of borrowed money.\nThe quote from world-famous\u00a0investor Warren Buffett that \"only when the tide goes out do you see who is swimming naked\" may turn out to apply in this case.\nA report on Friday from property analysts Urbanation showed that while the 2020 rental market started the year strong, there were already early signs of a slowdown in rental price increases. But with the arrival of COVID-19, that slowdown transformed into an absolute rental price dip.\n\"As demand fell faster than supply in the second half of March, rents experienced a slight decline,\" said the report. \"The average monthly rent in the post-COVID-19 period decreased 0.7 per cent\u00a0year-over-year.\"\nPeople like Hilliard MacBeth, long-time financial analyst and author of When the Bubble Bursts, have repeatedly warned that the over-leveraged Canadian property market was merely waiting for something to prick it with dangerous results for the whole economy. The Bank of Canada has said stress testing has shown Canada's financial system can take the heat.\nNonetheless, a report last week by business news service Bloomberg that Canadian property\u00a0\u2014 \"once safer than gold\" \u2014 is heading for a reckoning\u00a0was widely retweeted and sent shivers through the real estate sector.\nA two-decade, debt-fueled spending spree. A household debt-to-income ratio rivaling Iceland's before the financial crisis in Vancouver. 1 out of 3 workers applying for income support.

Banks have also been deferring the mortgage payments of rental property owners, prompting objections from those who blame short-term rentals, in particular, for soaring house prices and rents.\n\"Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\" Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver real estate agent\u00a0asked in the Bloomberg report.\nThere are plenty of signs that a plunge in tourism has already upset the shortest of rentals of the type offered by Airbnb hosts. And mortgage deferrals are not free money if the banks continue to charge\u00a0interest on the amounts landlords\u00a0invested in hope of earning a profit.\u00a0\nBut one well-respected adviser to the private sector property market has warned that pain for landlords is not over.\n\"All this is going to hit the rental market first,\" says Ben Rabidoux, who runs North Cove Advisors, an information service for the professional residential real estate market. Of course, a warning to landlords of falling rents will be good news for renters.\nIn one respect, Rabidoux is far less gloomy than some about the home resale market overall, saying defaults remain unlikely so long as the economic meltdown caused by COVID-19 is less than six months.\nBut the real estate insider says there are strong signals that just as the supply of rental properties is hitting a peak, the number of people wanting to rent is falling.\nThe devastated Airbnb market, down about 95 per cent, is only part of it. Unemployed gig workers and students are moving in with relatives. Immigration has slowed to a trickle.\nAnd Rabidoux's research shows that the influx of non-permanent residents, including foreign students and people on work permits to fill gaps in Canada's tight labour market, both of whom depend on the rental market and normally about 200,000-strong, has gone into reverse.\n\"We have a 50-year high in rental units under construction and a 50-year high in completions of those rental units coming online,\" says Rabidoux. That's over and above the current flood of condos built to sell to Canadians as rental investment properties. And once underway, he says, those projects will continue to inundate the market over a two-year timeline.\nWhile people who have bought homes to live in them will be less affected, falling rental prices will inevitably impact other parts of the market, convincing some to rent rather than buy, said Rabidoux.\n\"You're going to see it bleed into the resale market\u00a0three, six, nine\u00a0months down the road,\" he said.\nBut for anyone renting, maybe now is the time to start shopping around.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Sean Kavanagh", "title": "Construction groups tell City of Winnipeg to boost infrastructure spending", "description": "Construction industry says economy shocked by COVID-19 needs boost", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-pandemic-covid-19-infrastructure-economy-1.5546534", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4035210.1490134177!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/waverley-street-underpass.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 27, 2020 5:59 PM CT", "2020-04-27T22:59:42.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The head of the Manitoba Heavy Construction Association says jobs\u00a0\u2014 not ideology\u00a0\u2014 will help Winnipeg and Manitoba get through the growing economic crisis brought on by the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic.\nChris Lorenc\u00a0warned\u00a0councillors on the City of Winnipeg's finance committee on Monday\u00a0there is a \"lack of confidence in the economy by all sectors,\" and that way that could\u00a0stimulate it would be\u00a0by spending on infrastructure.\nIt's an opportune time to make the investments as competition in the the construction market is\u00a0strong and prices are low, Lorenc said.\n\"As difficult as it is for the disciples of fiscal balance \u2026 this is not the time for rampant austerity,\" he said. \"This is the time for stimulus to ensure or economy doesn't flatline.\"\nHis comments come as the provincial Progressive Conservative government tries to cut back spending on\u00a0services it does not consider\u00a0essential during the pandemic.

Like other sectors of Canadian real estate, the sudden economic downturn will expose faults in a rental market dependent on high levels of borrowed money.\nThe quote from world-famous\u00a0investor Warren Buffett that \"only when the tide goes out do you see who is swimming naked\" may turn out to apply in this case.\nA report on Friday from property analysts Urbanation showed that while the 2020 rental market started the year strong, there were already early signs of a slowdown in rental price increases. But with the arrival of COVID-19, that slowdown transformed into an absolute rental price dip.\n\"As demand fell faster than supply in the second half of March, rents experienced a slight decline,\" said the report. \"The average monthly rent in the post-COVID-19 period decreased 0.7 per cent\u00a0year-over-year.\"\nPeople like Hilliard MacBeth, long-time financial analyst and author of When the Bubble Bursts, have repeatedly warned that the over-leveraged Canadian property market was merely waiting for something to prick it with dangerous results for the whole economy.

Banks have also been deferring the mortgage payments of rental property owners, prompting objections from those who blame short-term rentals, in particular, for soaring house prices and rents.\n\"Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\" Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver real estate agent\u00a0asked in the Bloomberg report.\nThere are plenty of signs that a plunge in tourism has already upset the shortest of rentals of the type offered by Airbnb hosts. And mortgage deferrals are not free money if the banks continue to charge\u00a0interest on the amounts landlords\u00a0invested in hope of earning a profit.\u00a0\nBut one well-respected adviser to the private sector property market has warned that pain for landlords is not over.\n\"All this is going to hit the rental market first,\" says Ben Rabidoux, who runs North Cove Advisors, an information service for the professional residential real estate market. Of course, a warning to landlords of falling rents will be good news for renters.\nIn one respect, Rabidoux is far less gloomy than some about the home resale market overall, saying defaults remain unlikely so long as the economic meltdown caused by COVID-19 is less than six months.\nBut the real estate insider says there are strong signals that just as the supply of rental properties is hitting a peak, the number of people wanting to rent is falling.\nThe devastated Airbnb market, down about 95 per cent, is only part of it. Unemployed gig workers and students are moving in with relatives. Immigration has slowed to a trickle.\nAnd Rabidoux's research shows that the influx of non-permanent residents, including foreign students and people on work permits to fill gaps in Canada's tight labour market, both of whom depend on the rental market and normally about 200,000-strong, has gone into reverse.\n\"We have a 50-year high in rental units under construction and a 50-year high in completions of those rental units coming online,\" says Rabidoux. That's over and above the current flood of condos built to sell to Canadians as rental investment properties. And once underway, he says, those projects will continue to inundate the market over a two-year timeline.\nWhile people who have bought homes to live in them will be less affected, falling rental prices will inevitably impact other parts of the market, convincing some to rent rather than buy, said Rabidoux.\n\"You're going to see it bleed into the resale market\u00a0three, six, nine\u00a0months down the road,\" he said.\nBut for anyone renting, maybe now is the time to start shopping around.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "Lauren Pelley", "title": "Amid 'astronomical' house prices, councillors push for bigger tax rebate in first-time buyers' pockets", "description": "Some warn proposal could curb city revenue stream, push up home prices", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/amid-astronomical-house-prices-councillors-push-for-bigger-tax-rebate-in-first-time-buyers-pockets-1.5439671", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5440622.1580141833!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winter-real-estate-signs.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 25, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-01-25T16:18:17.343Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A pair of city councillors are pushing for a rethink of Toronto's municipal land transfer tax rebate for first-time home buyers, suggesting the cap should be increased to match the city's sky-high home prices.\nRight now, residents hoping to enter the market for the first time are offered\u00a0relief on the municipal portion of land transfer tax on properties worth up to $400,000\u00a0\u2014 which equals savings of $4,475.\nCoun.

In\u00a0Calgary, Edmonton, Regina and Saskatoon, house prices fell.\nThe average house price\u00a0in Charlottetown rose from $200,000\u00a0to $277,000. Of the areas commonly tracked by CREA, only the Niagara Region and Vancouver Island saw higher percentage price increases.\nGreg Lipton, president of the P.E.I. Real Estate Association, said the seeds of the hot housing market were sown with the arrival of immigrants through the provincial nominee program.\n\"They came with a lot of money and they wanted something new, and we didn't really have a lot of new stuff at that time,\" said Lipton.\n\"New construction is very expensive. We're up to close to $200 per square foot nowadays to get anything built.\"\nP.E.I. has been one of the fastest-growing provinces population wise, and immigration has been a big part of that .\nFrom 2010 to 2018 more than 12,000 immigrants came to the Island. But at the same time, P.E.I. has the worst five-year immigrant retention rate of any of the provinces.\nWhen those immigrants leave, said Lipton, they are looking to get a return on their housing investment, so the price of that house goes up a little more.\n\"There's not enough housing here right now, affordable or any other kind of housing, so once again people will pay the price.\"\nBut immigration is not the only driver of house prices.\nVacation rental services, such as Airbnb\u00a0and VRBO, have also been a factor, as property owners have figured out they can get $200 a night for a unit\u00a0instead of $1,000 a month on a one-year lease.\n\"Airbnb\u00a0is something that we were very unprepared for,\" said Lipton.\nThe possibility of higher return has led to an interest in purchasing more properties to convert to vacation rentals.\n\"The duplex all of a sudden turns into, well, it's going to be a triplex. And the triplex is all single bedrooms with a shared kitchen and a shared bathroom,\" said Lipton.\nThat activity is driving up demand and, consequently, prices.\nAnd\u00a0it has led to a shortage in the rental market.\nIn 2018,\u00a0the apartment vacancy rate was 0.2 per cent. Under those circumstances, students are scrambling for a place to live. This is bumping up prices in the vicinity of UPEI.\n\"Anything that's within walking distance of the university \u2014 a single family or duplex or triplex \u2014 the prices on those are getting to be astronomical now,\" said Lipton.\n\"You can rent to a student and get four or five students in a place.\"\nAt $400 each, that can bring in $2,000 a month.\nThis combination of new immigrants creating more valuable housing stock and new uses for housing driving demand has\u00a0created some of the fastest growing home prices in the country.\nIt should be noted, however, that prices in Charlottetown are still some of the most affordable in the country.\nThe $277,000 average represents six years of the median household income in the city. That's about the same as in Halifax, where it is 6.5 years, but well under the national average of 10 years.\nIn greater Vancouver, the average home takes 20 years of median household income to buy.\nBut while those prices may mean it is still possible for a household of median income to afford to buy a home, and recent trends have made it easier for tourists to book their stay and students to find a place to live, Ann Wheatley of the Cooper Institute said lower-income Islanders are being squeezed out.\nWheatley said at the core of the problem is less focus on houses as a place to live.\n\"It's an investment, and it seems today in this market that it's a relatively safe investment for people who have the money to invest.\"\nRecent market conditions bolster the argument for government-owned affordable housing, she said.\n\"A very effective way of dealing with the shortage of housing is to provide more publicly funded, publicly run housing,\" said Wheatley.\nRather than funding private development of affordable units, Wheatley would like to see the government take direct charge of affordable housing, to ensure that it stays affordable.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "Tips for selling your home in a buyers' market", "description": "In this market, sellers need to be realistic about the price they set", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tips-for-selling-your-home-during-a-buyers-market-1.5158342", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3152559.1469065864!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-recovery.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 02, 2019 9:00 AM PT", "2019-06-02T21:29:06.651Z"], "source": null, "content": "Any home will sell if the price is low enough but that's of little comfort to people trying to sell their homes during a buyers' market. \u00a0\nIn this market, sellers need to be realistic about the price they set.

An unkempt house and/or landscaping gives the impression that you haven't been maintaining the house properly and that there could be other issues.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf need be, hire a professional to do a deep clean. This means cleaning such things as the inside and outside of all your appliances, restoring your grout, and getting rid of any unpleasant smells.\nPainting and doing some minor renovations are a must. In a hot market, buyers are willing to look past imperfections like chipped tiles or a broken bannister but not in a slow market. \u00a0\u00a0\nDon't give the buyers any excuses to grind down your selling price. Clean, paint and fix what you can \u2014\u00a0as my handyman friend is fond of saying \"do your best and caulk the rest.\" A fresh layer of caulk around your moldings in the kitchen or bathroom does wonders.\nAt this time, I wouldn't recommend doing a major renovation.\u00a0We are nearing the end of\u00a0spring so you should be listing your home as soon as possible before we hit the slow summer months. Instead, work with what you have but present it in its best light by using a professional photographer. \u00a0\nYou may also want to consider hiring a home stager or borrowing some furniture, paintings and the like, to make your home more appealing to potential buyers.\nIf, after a couple of months, your property is receiving little or no interest from buyers then it might be time for a change. Consider pulling your listing and re-listing with another Realtor.\nIf you did your part by setting a realistic price, making yourself available for showings, and taking the time to clean/paint/stage your home, then the problem is likely due to the valuation/appraisal or marketing \u2014 which is the Realtor's responsibility. \u00a0\nI've only replaced my Realtor once in my life and it wasn't easy. He was a great guy who spent a fair amount of time and money to market my home but for whatever reason it didn't work. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you are trying to sell your home, which for most people is their largest financial asset, it's okay to put your needs before those of your Realtor's.\nMany of my recommendations seem like common sense, but so many sellers fail to adhere to them. All the cleaning, painting and repairing pays major dividends in the long run. Do not underestimate the importance of first impressions.\nWhen choosing a Realtor\u00a0be selective. Don't make the mistake of choosing the realtor who says they can get the most money for your home. Have them justify their appraisal and grill them on their marketing strategy. They also need strong negotiation skills.\nBe accessible for short-notice viewings \u2014 particularly in the first two weeks after listing.\nConsider every offer. Even if you believe an offer is\u00a0too low it doesn't mean you have to accept it. But I would still try to negotiate. \u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

You don't have a choice,\" he recalls.\u00a0\nThe manager, Marion says, was insistent that electrical upgrades were needed in the aging 36-unit complex in Montreal.\u00a0\n\"It's dangerous for your life, and the bank wants you to leave,\" Marion says he was told.\nOther tenants received the same message \u2014\u00a0and many left, watching as their former apartments were given a fresh coat of paint, new windows and appliances, and the rent went up as new tenants came in.\u00a0\nSo-called \"renovictions\" are up sharply across Canadian cities, complicating an already challenging housing situation.\nIn 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, and new Kijiji rental listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up.\nIn Montreal, housing advocate Martin Blanchard says it's a scenario that has happened before \u2014\u00a0every time vacancy rates drop toward zero, new owners snap up rental stock, renovate the units and increase the rent.\n\"We used to get 50 to 100 calls per year,\" from people complaining about being forced out of their apartments by landlords, says Blanchard, a community organizer with Comit\u00e9 logement de la Petite Patrie, a housing advocacy group. \"Now we get many hundreds every year. It's a crisis.\"\nBlanchard points largely to foreign firms, which are buying up older apartment complexes in Canada's big cities and attempting to jettison existing tenants so the rent can be jacked up beyond limits set by provincial governments.\n\"It's a way of making outrageous profits in a very short time. So they've got a little money put down, you can make a lot of profit, but it involves putting people on the street.\"\nLegislation protecting renters varies from province to province, but often a tenant cannot be evicted simply because a landlord wants to renovate. Renters should be able to remain at an apartment under existing rules.\nIf construction is so significant that a tenant must temporarily move out, the landlord is often required to allow them to return to the unit \u2014\u00a0at the same price.\nBut building owners don't always follow the rules, says Kenneth Hale, director of legal services for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario.\n\"These kinds of evictions deserve special scrutiny about whether the applications are being brought in good faith.\"\nTenants Ontario urges renters facing these circumstances not to agree to anything and to contact them, though acknowledge they are inundated with calls now as they seek to bring cases forward to the provincial tribunal, the Landlord and Tenant Board.\nMany of the cases that come across his desk involve low-level renovations that, he believes, are largely an excuse to get renters out in favour of those who will pay more.\nThe group has tracked a nearly four-fold increase in renovictions over the past couple of years, with cases reported to the centre soaring from 18 in 2015 to 71 in the 2018-19 fiscal year. It says the actual number is likely much higher, since the advocacy centre can only rely on what is reported to its office.\nHale wants new legislation to better protect tenants from renoviction.\n\"They should take away the economic incentive to evict people. And that would be by putting restrictions on the amount of rent increase that can happen in between tenants,\" says Hale. \"Because right now it's unlimited. And we just see it as an opportunity for landlords to rent-gouge, and that shouldn't be allowed.\"\nToronto city Coun. Paula Fletcher says she wants the provincial government to require that a building permit is obtained before a renoviction, and have building inspectors ensure that the renovation/demolition is so substantial that it is indeed imperative the tenant move out.\n\"I think the Ontario government needs to change the bar for the Landlord Tenant Board,\" she says.\nMarion is still holding on to his basement unit in Montreal, though two-thirds of the other apartments have been vacated, including that of his former neighbour Radina Papukchieva.\u00a0\n\"It was eight months of pressure, and it just became like a psychological stress,\" Papukchieva says.\n\"We had mice. Garbage wasn't getting picked up. They were doing everything to make us feel uncomfortable and unwanted in our own place.\"\nBut Papukchieva and Marion's former landlord disputes that. Abraham Kellner, the manager of the building, says plumbing fixes alone cost $100,000.\u00a0\n\"I can tell you that we did plumbing, electricity, kitchens, toilets, windows, floors,\" he says. \"I mean, it wasn't minor at all.\"\nThe company that bought the apartment tried to do the best for all parties and did everything in good faith, Kellner says.\nKellner wouldn't say how much rent new tenants coming in after the renovations\u00a0are being charged, but denied it had doubled.\n\"It depends on the apartment, but after it's renovated ... it's normal that it's going to be more,\" he says. \"But I wouldn't say double, and in some cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's hard to say, it's a lot of apartments.\"\nPapukchieva\u00a0said she, too,\u00a0is paying more because of the move, going from a monthly cost of $725 to $1,000 just to stay in an increasingly pricey neighbourhood.\n\"They want to simply do cosmetic changes to the apartments, make them look super nice, keep it like that \u2014\u00a0they're not doing anything to the exterior of the building,\"\u00a0Papukchieva\u00a0says.\nSome tenants pre-empt renovictions by offering to pay more to stay. But others aren't given the choice.\nIn Toronto, Ivan Wadgymar resisted an eviction notice \u2014\u00a0but lost in a tribunal because the new owners converted the building from residential to commercial. It was at the hearings, seeing other tenants in the same position, that he says he realized the impact the rapidly growing number of renovictions is having on the fabric of his city.\n\"It took me going to those meetings and seeing people cry who are getting evicted as well to make me understand what a home is \u2026 how important it is to feel that you have a home. And then get kicked out of it.\"\nThe owner of the company that bought his building says they \"approach all projects with the rights and respect of the tenants and the law in mind.\"\n\"We care about our community and we are dedicated to working with our city throughout the process,\" says Basem Hanna.\nBut Wadgymar feels the neighborhood is changing and is increasingly unaffordable.\nHe now helps others fight against renovictions, though he's doing so from a bedroom in his mother's house, because the small-business operator is no longer able to afford rent in the area he called home for three years.\n\"I've been pretty depressed since this happened,\" Wadgymar says. \"I haven't even unpacked my stuff \u2026 I'm still absorbing this.\"\nThe building where he used to live is now fenced off, with construction supplies visible through the windows. His name has been removed from the buzzer on the door.\nWith its proximity to the downtown core, Toronto's Leslieville neighbourhood has become increasingly desirable. Many of its low-rise apartment buildings are more than 50 years old and are being scooped up by companies with a track record for renovictions, according to Fletcher, the city councillor for the area.\n\"I always say we cannot build affordable housing as fast as tenants in these types of rental situations are being evicted,\" she says.\nWhen some tenants in Fletcher's ward got notices to leave recently, she joined them in a protest outside the building. She also wants the Landlord and Tenant Board to demand proof that planned renovations are so extensive, that there is no other option but for a tenant to move out.\n\"There's only a few companies that come in and do this, but they seem to have a plan. Get in. Get the building. Give the notices. Renovate. Triple the existing rent,\" she says. \"It's a pattern.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Rent in Ottawa out of reach for low-income earners, report finds", "description": "Tenants must earn $26 per hour to afford 2-bedroom apartment, think-tank says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-gatineau-kingston-rent-wage-1.5216379", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5031438.1563475078!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-rental-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 18, 2019 2:23 PM ET", "2019-07-19T14:54:16.913Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For workers earning minimum wage, Ottawa is one of the least affordable places in Canada to rent an apartment, according to a new report.\nThe report, published Thursday by the\u00a0Centre for Canadian Policy Alternatives (CCPA), calculates the rental wage \u2014 the hourly wage needed to rent an average two-bedroom apartment\u00a0without spending more than 30 per cent\u00a0of a tenant's\u00a0earnings \u2014 in communities over 10,000 people.\nIn Ottawa, where the average rent for a two-bedroom unit is $1,301, an employee\u00a0earning\u00a0Ontario's\u00a0$14 per hour minimum wage would have to work 75 hours per week to afford the rent.

The last census year was 2016 and the next one is coming up next year.\u00a0\nWestern University sociology professor\u00a0Michael Haan, who is the Canada research chair in migration and ethnic relations, says one big factor is that London is doing a better job of attracting immigrants.\u00a0\nA few years ago, Haan was involved in research that flagged London was lagging as a destination for new immigrants.\u00a0\n\"London wasn't on the map until recently,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut that's changed due to a few factors.\u00a0\nHaan said one big plus is that Fanshawe\u00a0College and Western University are actively recruiting international students. In 2016-17 just under 10,000 international students came to London across all academic classes. He believes that number has\u00a0continued to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"And those count in terms of the population estimates that Stats Can releases,\" he said.\u00a0\nAlso, the city in 2018 approved\u00a0a newcomer strategy, with a full-time immigration specialist focused on getting newcomers to Canada to consider London as their\u00a0landing spot. There's also a city website with links to information newcomers need.\n\"In the past, we weren't welcoming our share of newcomers, so the city rightly decided that they needed to become a little bit more proactive in attracting people,\" said Haan, who helped with research for the strategy.\u00a0\nAnother boost for London is the recent growth of the U.S. economy.\u00a0\n\"When that happens, manufacturing hubs like London tend to rebound a bit,\"\u00a0said Haan. \"So it's possible that people who\u00a0left during the downturn are now returning.\"\u00a0\nAnother plus for London is that despite a steady surge in real-estate prices in recent years, it still remains an affordable market for many of those who feel priced out of Toronto and other larger Canadian cities.\u00a0\nHe says an important component of this\u00a0is that London has housing options for aging Baby Boomers who've had enough of raking leaves and shovelling snow.\n\"London's housing market seems to appeal to people as they exit the labour market,\" said Haan. \"My hunch is that we're picking up some retirees from places like Toronto where people can liquidate their housing assets and move to a place like London with money in their pockets.\"\n\"A lot of the new housing types are being set up for people in their elder years,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Kevin Yarr", "title": "Charlottetown house prices pushing point of 'being inaccessible'", "description": "'If the worst case scenario comes out he will be 70 years old before his house is fully paid off'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-house-affordability-1.5234240", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4074516.1492548977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pei-real-estate-2.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 8:56 AM AT", "2019-08-02T14:43:08.797Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The average Charlottetown home is still affordable to the average Charlottetown family, says a financial advisor, but won't be soon if prices keep rising as they have been.\nHouse prices are up 38.5 per cent in the last three years, with the average home going for $277,000. That's a tight squeeze for the average household after-tax income of about $48,000, said Daniel Martens of Martens Financial.\n\"It's still feasible,\" said Martens.\n\"We're getting to a point of it being inaccessible and too costly for Islanders to afford homes. We're at six times income now to purchase a home and things don't look like they're slowing down with home prices. So that's a bit concerning.\"\nWith five per cent down and a 3.5 per cent interest rate, the average family buying the average home is looking at a monthly payment of $1,314, or 33 per cent of their after-tax income. That's right on the bubble of the recommended 30 to 35 per cent maximum spending on shelter, and it doesn't include insurance or home maintenance.\nJust three years ago, that family could be expecting to pay 25 per cent of their after-tax income on their mortgage. If prices and incomes continue to rise at the same rate, in three years that would be 41 per cent.\nThat's a concern for Martens. A 25-year-old client who comes to him with no down payment, he said, will need about three years to save up for one. But that assumes house prices don't go up, so add another year. You could apply for the province's house down payment program. It's an interest-free loan, which Martens said has helped some of his clients, but it is still debt that can add a couple of hundred dollars a month to your payments.\nWith a standard 25-year amortization, that house is paid off when the client is 54. That's not too bad. But consider as well, interest rates are at historic lows. They are unlikely to stay that low for the next three decades.\nIf in 10 years, when the mortgage is coming up for its second renewal, the rates have gone up two or three per cent, that will add significantly to the payments. In order to keep them down, the temptation will be to extend the amortization period.\n\"What that does is now instead of 29 years to purchase your home and buy it could be 35 years before you're able to do it, and you could even be encroaching onto 40,\" said Martens.\nNow our 25-year-old is 65 before the house is paid for, and it gets worse if you start any later.\n\"I'll give you an example of a friend of mine. He's 30 years old he just purchased his first home. The numbers are very similar to what the averages are,\" said Martens.\n\"We've worked out a few different scenarios. But if the worst case scenario comes out he will be 70 years old before his house is fully paid off. That's scary.\"\nCPP and OAS payments would not even cover the mortgage payments. Continuing to work past 65 would be an absolute necessity, Martens said.\nSomething has to give, said Martens. He doesn't like the look of the Island if house prices continue to go up as they have been.\n\"We need mechanisms to help fight it because soon enough Islanders aren't going to be able to afford to live in the province they grew up in, and that's not something that I would like to see,\" he said.\nIn a statement to CBC News, the Department of Social Development and Housing said it is focused on increasing the supply of affordable housing not just in Charlottetown, but across the province.\nThis housing is aimed more at low-income households, but the department said that the rate of construction of new homes overall has increased.\n\"Although we are unable to\u00a0control the market, our goal is to increase the housing inventory for those most vulnerable,\" the statement said.\nHousing availability will be increased by these efforts, the province said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Home sales continue to rise after record low early this year, CREA reports", "description": "Average price up 5.5% from year ago, up 3.3% outside Toronto, Vancouver", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crea-september-housing-1.5321014", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321016.1571148126!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-home-sales-20191015.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 15, 2019 10:14 AM ET", "2019-10-15T14:14:44.583Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Canadian Real Estate Association says the number of home sales in September rose 15.5 per cent compared with a year ago, as sales in the country's big cities climbed higher.\nThe association says sales rose in Canada's large urban markets, including B.C.'s Lower Mainland, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton-Burlington, Ottawa and Montreal.\nOn a month-over-month basis, home sales through the Canadian Multiple Listing Service were up 0.6 per cent in September.\nHome sales in Canada have been climbing since hitting a six-year low in February.\nThe national average price for homes sold in September 2019 was about $515,500, up 5.3 per cent from the same month last year.\nExcluding the Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto regions, the average price was less than $397,000 and amounting to a year-over-year gain of 3.3 per cent.\n"}, {"author": "Catherine Cullen", "title": "Conservative millennials lay out a policy wish list for the party", "description": "To attract younger voters, millennials say the party must embrace diversity and tackle poverty", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/millennial-conservatives-1.5443425", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5419167.1579565379!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/conservative-leadership-20170526.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 02, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-02-02T18:54:08.408Z"], "source": "CBC", "content": "Leadership races can be bruising, bare-knuckled slugfests for political dominance.

He used to manage government advertising in Stephen Harper's PMO; these days he's a vice-president at Enterprise Canada.\nIn a recent Twitter cri de coeur, he reflected on what he described as his party's need to be contemporary.\nThe Conservative Party should embrace policies for the new decade, he said, by engaging on topics that matter to younger Canadians,\u00a0such as the opioid epidemic and the spread of workplace automation.\nOne thing I'd love to see on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twitter</a> or elsewhere is more discussions on conservative policies into the 2020s. What are the solid right-wing answers to poverty, insane housing costs, AI, opioid epidemic, manufacturing job loss, what social media is doing to society, China, etc.\nWe decided to ask some Conservative millennials which issues they'd like see their party take on to win over young voters.\nFighting\u00a0poverty should be a Conservative goal, said Shakir Chambers, a former senior policy adviser to Ontario Premier Doug Ford who also worked in Stephen Harper's PMO.\n\"I think if you're a Conservative you believe that anybody who is able-bodied wants to work ... So how do we create business incentives for folks to actually invest and hire those folks to get them the job experience they need and get in the door?\" he said.\nChambers, 35,\u00a0is thinking in particular about policies that would help people with\u00a0criminal records.\u00a0\n\"I think a lot of these folks, all they need is to open the door to get in and get some job experience so they can show\u00a0people, 'Listen, I have a criminal record but I'm not a bad person and I want to work.'\"\nThe dream of owning a home seems increasingly out of reach for some millennials, said Matthews.\n\"This is an issue that has real electoral implications in urban and suburban Canada and means completely different things in other parts of the country,\" he said, pointing\u00a0to soaring housing prices in Toronto and Vancouver in particular.\nMatthews said he doesn't know any quick solutions. The federal government will need to get creative, he said, adding he believes it could play a role in\u00a0\"breaking the logjam\" keeping many people out of the housing market.\nThe workplace is changing fast, thanks to widespread automation and the growth of the \"gig economy.\" Many millennials know they can expect their career paths\u00a0to be much different from those of their parents. Young Conservatives say they would like to see their party come up with policies to address that.\nThirty-three year old Alberta MP Garnett Genuis\u00a0said he would like to see policies that make it easier to work from home.\nMore and more stay-at-home\u00a0parents are operating home-based businesses, he said. Other parents may want to take parental leave while still being able to work on a few files from the office.\nHe said he'd like to see what he calls\u00a0\"family friendly\"\u00a0tax changes that would make those things easier.\nParents, he said, should be able to earn some income while on leave without facing aggressive income tax clawbacks, while the work-from-home tax deduction should be easier to access.\nThe Conservatives also should be thinking about policies to address the spread of automation, and to attract young people to the skilled trades, said 27-year-old Lauren McDonald, a former director of marketing for Premier Ford.\nShe points to the Ontario government's campaign to get young people to consider the\u00a0trades. It's intended to help address labour shortages, she said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it also could help young people consider a career path they hadn't before.\n\"When you traditionally think about skilled trades, you think about NDP and unions,\" she said.\nChambers said he wants to see the next Conservative leader do more to grow support among\u00a0minority voters. Doing that\u00a0 could involve everything from attending cultural events to putting forward\u00a0policies that speak to those communities' concerns, he said.\nChambers points to his own experience. His family is from the Caribbean and every year at Christmas, he said, he gets asked why he's a Conservative.\nHe said he believes it's something his party struggles with in many minority communities.\n\"They like our policy but they might think, as a minority, 'I shouldn't be a Conservative,'\u00a0because you don't see a lot of minorities in the party,\" said Chambers, a senior consultant with the PR firm Navigator.\nHe said he's heard people say\u00a0Conservative parties accept\u00a0diversity\u00a0\u2014 but don't necessarily celebrate it.\nTo improve that image, Chambers\u00a0said, Conservatives should take lessons from Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. Back when he was the federal minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Kenney was a constant fixture at cultural\u00a0community events across the country \u2014 part of a (largely successful) Conservative\u00a0campaign to win over new voters.\nGenuis\u00a0said he would like to see his party tackle online hate aimed at\u00a0minority groups\u00a0as part of a larger emphasis on civil rights.\n\"We have a particular appreciation of the importance of freedom of speech that isn't shared by other parties in the same way,\" he said.\u00a0\"But I think we can and we must do both.\"\nHe cites something he heard about recently through his work as the party's critic on multicultural issues \u2014 an image being shared online of a mock \"licence\" for hunting Muslims.\u00a0\nHe notes that while\u00a0there are laws prohibiting some of the worst online behaviour, it's not always clear that the authorities are as quick to act as some community members would like.\n\"Clearly, there's a problem out there in this space.\"\nTechnology has created a host of policy challenges, from growing automation displacing workers\u00a0to new virtual currencies. Dennis Matthews wants to add social isolation to that list.\nA U.K. government investigation into loneliness suggested it's as harmful to human health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\n\"It's a bigger question of what type of country and society do we want to build, and how we create a sense of patriotism, a sense of belonging that were hallmarks of conservative movements for so long,\"\u00a0said Matthews. \"How do you create a 2020 version of that?\"\nWhile it's not a problem that can be addressed overnight, Matthews points to social isolation as the kind of policy topic that could get many Canadians to engage with Conservatives.\nFinancial literacy means a lot more than just knowing how to use a bank account, said Chambers.\nHe said he'd like to see the federal government work with other levels of government to make sure young people know more about doing their taxes and how to invest.\n\"I think there are a lot of folks out there who know nothing about how money actually works.\"\nHe said it's an idea his party ought to embrace\u00a0because young people who understand money would\u00a0be\u00a0more likely to support the Conservatives.\nMcDonald, who's now director of\u00a0digital public affairs and campaign strategy at the lobbying firm Proof Strategies, said she knows that the plight of seniors might not be the most obvious policy topic for a millennial.\nBut she said she believes\u00a0many people her age are concerned about older Canadians.\n\"The huge baby boomer, silver wave is coming. They're seeing that and worry about what their parents are going to be [experiencing]\u00a0in terms of health care, long term care, hospital wait times,\" she said.\u00a0\"How are we positioning ourselves to be ready for that?\"\nOn this issue and others, McDonald argues Conservatives need to put more focus on the \"people\" side of policy.\n\"I know Conservatives, often times the language is 'the taxpayer', 'the voter', 'the constituent'. I think turning our minds to the people on the other end of the policy can help us think more intimately about how that's going to affect people in the long run.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stratford accepting applications for affordable housing project", "description": "35 units will available priced at 80 per cent of the local average market rent", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/stratford-ontario-affordable-housing-project-1.5200510", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5200634.1562275688!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/britannia.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 06, 2019 6:00 AM ET", "2019-07-06T10:00:00.223Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As local residents cope with an increasingly tight rental market, the City of Stratford, Ont., is accepting applications for a new affordable housing project.\nThe rental building on Britannia Street\u00a0will include 35 units: 20 one-bedroom apartments and 15 two-bedroom apartments, says Eden Grodzinski, the city's manager of housing.\n\"All different types of households are welcome, whether it's a single mother with a child or seniors,\" Grodzinski said. \"It's just open to everybody.\"\nThe units are priced at 80 per cent of the current rental market, which works out to $825\u00a0a month for the one-bedroom units and $1080 for the two-bedrooms.

Green means there's little evidence of a problem, yellow means there's some reason for concern, and red means there is a high risk.\nNationally, the CMHC\u00a0gives the housing market a yellow. It's the second quarter in a row for that rating, after assessments for the previous two and a half years\u00a0found there to be a high level of concern overall. Across the country, the CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration, or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag.\n\"Moderate evidence of overvaluation continues to be the only sign of vulnerability for Canada as a whole,\" CMHC's chief economist Bob Dugan said. \"Imbalances between house prices and housing market fundamentals have narrowed with declining home prices in the resale market and a growing pool of potential first-time home buyers.\"\nWhile the national picture is looking OK, there are regional pockets of major worry in various places across the country.\nRegina was given a red warning flag for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were also given a red overall because they all scored solid yellows in every category except that one. \"However, conditions for these factors are showing signs of easing in all three centres,\" the CMHC said.\nVancouver used to be on the red flag list, but came off it in the past quarter, mainly because prices have come down a little even as fundamentals have improved \u2014 in the CMHC's estimation. While the city's real estate is still moderately overvalued, there's little evidence of the other three categories, which is why it was a yellow flag overall.\nMoving east from B.C., Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg all scored yellows overall, mainly because of overbuilding. Otherwise, it's almost all green except for some modest overvaluation in Winnipeg.\nAcross central and eastern Canada,\u00a0Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Moncton, Halifax and St. John's were all deemed low risks overall, although\u00a0Montreal\u00a0and\u00a0Moncton\u00a0were singled out for overheating, while St John's is showing signs of\u00a0overbuilding.\nOverall, the agency says the real estate market is looking a little better mainly because average prices are ticking down, even as incomes and population levels keep rising.\n\"Combined with declining home prices in the resale market, these dynamics contribute to maintaining the average estimate of overvaluation near zero,\" the CMHC said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Nearly 1 in 10 homes sold in Waterloo region cities either flipped or rented out: study", "description": "Kitchener saw most short-term sale and investment activity, report says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cmhc-report-housing-market-waterloo-kitchener-cambridge-1.5246991", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4608263.1526058958!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/open-house-sign-guelph-for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 15, 2019 8:31 AM ET", "2019-08-15T12:31:00.076Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Nearly one in ten homes sold in Waterloo region's cities are either sold off quickly or purchased and leased out, a new report says.\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) released a new report Thursday morning, saying nine per cent of all homes that went on the market in Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge between Jan. 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018, were either for short-term gain or long-term investment.\nThis was a time frame that saw the real estate market in the cities heat up, with\u00a0bidding wars over homes as well as\u00a0houses selling for record-high prices.\n\"Perhaps unsurprisingly, investment activity became more pronounced as the pace of average price growth increased, which makes intuitive sense since there is larger potential gains to be realized in a market where prices are growing rapidly,\" the report said.\nFor the report, the CMHC defined a short-term sale as a house bought and sold within a 24-month period.\nA long-term investment was considered a home purchased and leased out within 24 months \"since this illustrates that the buyer had no intention of living in the unit long-term.\"\nKitchener saw the most short-term sales and investment activity out of the three cities, the report said.\nThis is \"partly because Kitchener has the largest population,\" the report notes, but \"population size alone does not entirely explain the findings.\"\u00a0\nKitchener has seen a steady rise in short-term and investment sales\u00a0from 2012 to 2018, the report said.\nThat may be in part due to the ION LRT.\nIn 2012, 7.8 per cent of all short-term sales and long-term investments were within one kilometre of an LRT station.\nThat rose to 14.4 per cent in 2017, although the report notes those sales did fall in the first two quarters of 2018, which is also when prices started to stabilize in the local real estate market.\nThe report noted for short-term sales or long-term investments, one in five buyers were identified as being a \"non-local buyer.\" That means the buyer did not have an address in Kitchener, Waterloo or Cambridge.\nThe report said 72 per cent of those non-local buyers were from the Greater Toronto Area, followed by Guelph in second place and Hamilton in third.\n"}, {"author": "Ashley Burke", "title": "Lack of affordable housing on Vancouver Island forces family to sleep in a tent and a van", "description": "'I don\u2019t know how anyone could hear that story and not be heartbroken': Singh", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bc-housing-singh-crisis-1.5299158", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299182.1569544219!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/betty-nicolaye.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 8:49 PM ET", "2019-09-27T02:23:36.741Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\u00a0\nJagmeet Singh learned first-hand Thursday about the affordable housing crunch, when a weeping Betty\u00a0Nicolaye came to his campaign event to tell him that she and her family were living in a backyard because they couldn't find rental accommodations.\nThe NDP leader called her\u00a0story heartbreaking.\nNicolaye says she sleeps\u00a0in a tent and\u00a0her three children live in a beat-up motor home in a family member's yard, because her family can't find an affordable place to live in Campbell River, B.C.\u00a0\nThe 69-year-old has been searching for a house to rent since April, after her landlord put the home where she was living\u00a0up for sale.

More specifically, the affordability of housing.\nReal estate in Whitehorse\u00a0is\u00a0booming, and has been for a while. House prices have been on a steady upward climb in recent years. Rentals are hard to come by.\nThe most recent data from the Yukon Bureau of Statistics put the average house sale price in Whitehorse in the second quarter of 2019 at a record-high $529,500 \u2014 a 10.5 per cent increase from a year earlier. The average condo went for $354,700.\n\"We have a shortage of affordable housing \u2014\u00a0entry-level type housing,\" said Marc Perreault, president of the Yukon Real Estate Association.\n\"It pushes people into having to buy homes that are more expensive than they would like to, or could, or can. And it pushes the prices up because people are getting the prices they're asking for homes ... we've seen it for years now, and it's a difficult issue to address.\"\nFor Cory Levasseur and his partner, it was enough to drive them out of the territory. They originally moved up from Ontario last year when his partner found work in Yukon as a firefighter, but after a year they reluctantly decided to go back.\n\"To just find a, you know, just a house or apartment that would be affordable on our budget, it was next to impossible to find,\" Levasseur said.\n\"It was bittersweet. I did not want to leave \u2014 at all. And I still think about it every day.\"\nFor Meg Grudeski, housing coordinator for the Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition, it's not just a matter of building more houses \u2014 although that's part of it.\nShe says Yukon simply does not have enough options for people with varied needs and financial resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Housing is growing as an issue as we see income disparity continue to expand \u2014 so the gap between folks who are on fixed income or low income, and folks who aren't, is getting larger,\" Grudeski said.\n\"There is a continuum of housing that needs to be available.\"\u00a0\nThat also means looking beyond Whitehorse, she says. Some people in Whitehorse may want to move back to their home communities, where housing is more affordable \u2014 but they won't if it means they can't access the services they need.\n\"People have to make very difficult decisions,\" she said.\nGrudeski\u00a0thinks it's something the federal government should take seriously, and partner\u00a0with local governments to find solutions.\u00a0\nDoris Bill,\u00a0chief of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation in Whitehorse, agrees. \u00a0\n\"Affordable housing is really a big issue in the territory. And I just really hope that whichever federal party gets in and forms government would make it a priority,\" she said.\n\"It's a community problem and we all need to be a part of the solution.\"\nSome in Whitehorse, including the Real Estate Association, have high hopes for the First Nation's plan to offer up land for lease on its territory. That could happen by next year.\nBut Bill says that's not the whole solution.\n\"It's not. It's maybe a portion of the solution, but there are other solutions out there that we need to explore,\" she said.\n\"Housing Yukoners\u00a0is not Kwanlin D\u00fcn's problem. It is everyone's problem. And government has a role in that.\" \u00a0\nYukon's federal candidates were asked for their take. They were asked how big of an issue they\u00a0think\u00a0housing is, and what solutions they might propose.\u00a0\nHere are some of their emailed statements, provided to Radio-Canada. They have been edited for length.\nLarry Bagnell, Liberal\n\"As I have said through out the campaign, the most important issues are climate change and housing.\n\"We have already funded a number of housing projects in the Yukon, both in Whitehorse and the communities. We have over 25 housing or homelessness initiatives with Yukon First Nations. But there is much more to do.\u00a0\n\"Starting\u00a0in 2020, we will implement the Canada Housing Benefit, a program that will assist over 300,000 families and provide an estimated average of $2,500 per year to each household that is having difficulty affording their rental payments.\u00a0\n\"Budget 2019 introduced the First Time Homebuyer's incentive, to help 100,000 first time home buyers, by having the federal government purchase up to 10 per cent\u00a0of their mortgage, thus making their mortgage payment lower.\u00a0\n\"We have also announced, that we would provide up to $40,000 interest free loans to up to 1.5 million Canadians to make their homes more energy and cost efficient, thus more affordable.\"\nJustin Lemphers, NDP\u00a0\n\"Access to housing is a critically important issue in Yukon. Without a safe place to call home, people are increasingly vulnerable and living at risk.\u00a0\n\"A New Democrat government will partner with provinces, territories, and municipalities to\u00a0create half a million units of affordable housing over the next 10\u00a0years. This will include social housing, community, and non-market housing, as well as co-ops. We'll make sure that affordable housing investments go to rural and northern communities too.\n\"We will spur the construction of affordable homes by\u00a0waiving the GST in Yukon\u00a0on the construction of new affordable rental units \u2014\u00a0a simple change that will help get new units built faster and keep them affordable for the long term.\n\"We will re-introduce\u00a030-year terms to CMHC insured mortgages\u00a0on entry-level homes for first time home buyers allowing for\u00a0smaller monthly payments.\n\"We'll also double the Home Buyer's\u00a0Tax Credit to $1,500\u00a0to help people with closing costs.\"\nLenore Morris, Green\n\"Housing is likely the number one\u00a0local issue in Yukon. Lack of access to affordable housing is a territory-wide problem but is most acute in the First Nations communities.\u00a0\n\"The solution is to build new affordable housing and\u00a0to renovate some of the existing housing. We need to increase our stock of public housing but I would also like to see incentives provided to private developers/builders, to build affordable housing, especially rental housing, rather than more high price condos and homes. I would also like to see this construction used as an opportunity to increase skills and capacity, in the communities in particular \u2014\u00a0to create jobs for people living there.\"\nJonas Smith, Conservative\n\"If we are going to attract, recruit and retain the workers we need across all sectors from health care and mental health services to responsible mineral development and aviation, the access to land availability and therefore accessible housing development costs is crucial to our territory's sustainability and self-determination.\n\"We are committed to tax cuts for small businesses, seniors and young families alike. We will eliminate the carbon tax and the GST on home heating fuel; a necessity here in the territory.\n\"I will work to ensure Yukoners have more money in their pockets, which can be allocated to their sheltering needs.\u00a0\n\"This, paired\u00a0with\u00a0what I think is one of the federal government's largest and most\u00a0important\u00a0roles; which is to support Yukon First Nations governments and their respective development corporations, with their land availability process, in order to make housing development costs more attainable for Yukoners.\"\nJoseph Zelezny, People's Party\n\"Housing is important just like everything else but more government interference is not the answer. The markets are inflated thanks to cheap debt and higher government fees and taxes. The incentives that exist in some cases due to government interference are backwards and also the value of houses reflect in part the devaluation of Canadian dollars.\n\"Cutting taxes and reducing the influence of government in\u00a0people's lives and repealing the economy-killing regulations like Bill C-69 and the carbon tax will enable prosperity and wage growth which will allow for a rebalancing between the value of a home and annual income. The gap is too great.\n\"Immigration numbers also must be reduced nationwide to reduce demand on limited supply.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "15 new affordable units give Victoria seniors chance to be more independent", "description": "Housing agency says older people are getting priced out of the housing market and ending up in shelters", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/victoria-bc-affordability-seniors-homeless-1.5351032", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5351040.1573094567!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/shawn-kuin.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 07, 2019 7:23 AM PT", "2019-11-07T15:23:10.197Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sixteen years ago, Shawn Kuin was homeless, working winters in hotel construction or other site jobs that gave him a place to stay.\nNow, the 62-year-old has his own apartment with a view of the Lieutenant Governor's mansion in Victoria.\n\"Having a regular place to stay and meals, I could work,\" he said. \"I've been able to get full-time employment.\"\nKuin is one of the first tenants to move into the third floor of Mount Edwards Court on Vancouver Street.

He said the main reason he's in his current apartment is that he was first to respond to an offer from the landlord.\u00a0\n\"I think they said they had over 100 people that they were picking from,\" said Bradley. \"So had I not responded in time, it wouldn't have worked out so well for me.\"\n"}, {"author": "Nicole Williams ", "title": "Proposed tenant eviction rules coming too late for these P.E.I. renters", "description": "'People are getting put out of their homes'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/p-e-i-renoviction-24-water-street-1.5478024", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5478554.1582833414!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/marlene-gallant-dylan-menzie-and-dave-neatby.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 7:02 AM AT", "2020-02-28T14:13:04.718Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group of soon-to-be-evicted tenants is saying proposed changes to P.E.I.'s residential tenancy legislation are coming too late.\nThe nine residents at 24 Water Street in Charlottetown were given an eviction notice this month, telling them\u00a0they would need to move out of their apartments by April 30 because of work being done to the building.\nThe letter outlines plans for a building that will be constructed next door, and that in order to move ahead with those plans, a fire-escape and sprinkler system needs to be installed to 24 Water Street.\nThat requires drilling holes inside the apartment units and the property manager, Jon Locke, said tests have shown there is asbestos inside the walls, meaning no one can be in there while work is ongoing.\nSeveral of the tenants say, though they were given the required notice, as long-term residents\u00a0they wish they had been given\u00a0more time.\u00a0\n\"I was pretty shocked and pretty full of anxiety,\"\u00a0said Dave Neatby, who's lived in the building for five years.\u00a0\n\"The big question is, 'Where am I going to live?' because I'm on a disability pension at the moment.

I can't afford a car.

I've been looking around and there's nothing available out there.

If residents want to move back into the building after the renovations are complete, the landlord still has to compensate them, as well as allow them back at the same rental price.\nBut residents like\u00a0Palazova said they don't know where they would go while the renovations take place.\n\"I think most of us, if we're forced to leave this building, are just going to give up and leave the city,\" she said.\nRoger Moores, who has\u00a0been a tenant in the building for 11 years, said he'd also have to come up with a lot of money if he had to leave his current unit.\nBut he, Palazona and others at the building said they've found legal representation to fight the eviction at\u00a0the Landlord and Tenant Board.\n\"It takes a lot to intimidate me,\" Moores\u00a0said.\n\"When it comes right down to it, we do not have to move.\"\nFletcher said while the city is aiming to build more affordable housing, they also need to find ways to protect it.\n\"We are losing places faster than we're giving somebody the keys for a new affordable unit,\" she said.\n\"This is just shining a light on this practice, which is more and more prevalent in many communities, and it just seems wrong.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Looking back at a decade of Vancouver real estate", "description": "'It's been a long and strange trip,' says urban planning professor Andy Yan", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-real-estate-andy-yan-1.5411244", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4999941.1562873249!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 31, 2019 9:18 PM PT", "2020-01-01T05:18:58.794Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The last decade was a tumultuous one for Vancouver's real estate market, according to researcher\u00a0Andy Yan.\nYan, a professor in urban planning and the director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University, has spent a decade poring over the data of one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.\u00a0\n\"It's been a long and strange trip,\" Yan told CBC's Gloria Macarenko on On The Coast.\u00a0\nHe kicked off the start of the decade with a major paper that detailed the number of empty condos in the city \u2014 noting\u00a0that nearly a quarter of condos in some parts of downtown Vancouver were empty.\nIn 2015, Yan published another study that attempted to establish\u00a0if\u00a0there was a link between foreign buyers and house prices on the city's tony West side neighbourhoods.\nIt was the beginning of a much closer look at the connections and global forces that were converging to create the massive surge in housing prices that characterized much of the decade.\u00a0\nYan said what he realized from his research how closely the\u00a0real estate market in Vancouver is connected to what's happening elsewhere in the world.\u00a0\n\"It's a story of connection as opposed to isolation that I think helped symbolized the last 10 years,\" Yan said. \"What's happening in metropolitan Vancouver, in British Columbia in general, it is connected to what's happening elsewhere, whether it's nationally or globally.\"\nAnd some of the solutions had international origins.

Craig Sauv\u00e9, the councillor responsible for housing.\n\"We think that in one year of signing this bylaw we'll be able to create 600 units of social housing and other several hundred units of affordable under-market housing and family housing,\" he said. \"That's just from this bylaw alone. So it's a pretty powerful tool and a lot of people are very excited about it in Montreal.\"\nOther jurisdictions are excited about it too, according to\u00a0Sauv\u00e9. Neighbouring municipalities are considering adopting it, he said, and he's been fielding\u00a0calls from officials across Canada, asking for details.\nThe bylaw is complex, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, but it makes it more expensive for developers to do the pay-out option, so they're more likely to build some turn-key affordable housing units.\nThat's\u00a0the \"best possible scenario\" for the city because it avoids the headache\u00a0of dealing with a construction project and delivers the units to citizens\u00a0in need sooner.\nIt's often referred to as the 20-20-20 bylaw, said\u00a0Sauv\u00e9, because it calls for 20 per cent non-profit housing, 20 per cent affordable sub-market housing and 20 per cent \"family housing,\" which means three bedrooms or more to create more housing stock for families to live within the city core.\nThe initiative comes amid a housing crunch in Montreal.\nThe rental market has become increasingly competitive, due to increased demand and rising real estate prices, leaving low-income families especially vulnerable.\nSauv\u00e9\u00a0said the bylaw\u00a0may not be a so-called magic bullet to solve homelessness, but he does believe it's a \"piece of the puzzle.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante wants the bylaw, which still needs to be approved by council,\u00a0to be in effect by Jan.\u00a01, 2021.\n"}, {"author": "Adam van der Zwan", "title": "Government says new Victoria micro-apartments will help with middle-income housing crisis", "description": "Housing advocates say the project still doesn't address the growing need for middle-income family housing", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/government-says-new-victoria-micro-apartments-will-help-with-middle-income-housing-crisis-1.5254183", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5254188.1566355315!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/microlofts-victoria.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 20, 2019 7:47 PM PT", "2019-08-21T02:47:38.358Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The federal government says a new micro-unit apartment in downtown Victoria will be a step closer to relieving the ever-growing middle-income housing crisis.\u00a0\n\"The 60-unit project will receive $13.25 million [in] support from the federal government,\" said Adam Vaughan, parliamentary secretary to the federal minister of families, children and social development.\nLike other Canadian cities, Victoria's affordable housing options are shrinking as wages stagnate and rental prices increase.

The program is available to\u00a0first-time homebuyers who earn\u00a0less than $120,000 a year, but under the expanded program those with incomes up to $150,000 will qualify.\nUnder the program, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) kicks in up to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the home, as long as the borrower comes up with the minimum amount for an insured mortgage, which is now set at five\u00a0per cent.\nUnder the current terms of the program, a buyer qualifies for assistance only if\u00a0the total value of the mortgage, plus the CMHC's portion, does not exceed $480,000.

Fullarton said members of the association have reported a 30 to 40 per cent increase in developers offering contracts for apartment and condo buildings.\nIn 2019, Moncton issued building permits for 16 new apartment buildings with 727 units, 68 new single-unit homes, and 114 duplex units.\u00a0\nCombined, residential permits accounted for 37.7 per cent of\u00a0$257.4 million in building permits issued last year, a new city record.\nLast year was also record-setting for Dieppe, where permits worth $96 million topped a $90 million record set in 2016. Dieppe's figures include permits for 314 new housing units, though the largest single permit was for the city's new arena complex.\nIn Riverview, the town issued permits worth a total of $25 million, shy of the 2015 record of $29 million.\u00a0\nAll of the construction activity means steady employment for people in the construction industry, Fullarton said. It's meant a shortage of workers in some trades that prompted the organization to plan a national and international recruitment campaign.\nThe region's immigration strategy calls for 2,700 to 3,500 immigrants per year by 2024 to sustain economic growth and fill jobs.\u00a0\nWishart said there are downsides, including the increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment from $698 in 2018 to $732 in October 2019.\n\"If you're bringing jobs to the community and you need to find housing for them, that is becoming difficult, especially for families,\" Wishart said. \"Maybe it's a good problem to have, but I'm not sure we can build (housing) fast enough and or at the right types.\"\nIn recent years, monthly home sales reports from the Greater Moncton Realtors du Grand Moncton have described the region's housing market breaking records.\nParise Cormier, president of the association, called it a sellers market. The inventory of homes on the market has hit a 15-year low, which she said has resulted in some homes getting multiple purchase offers.\n\"Prices are slowly creeping up, but we don't have markets like you see in bigger cities,\" Cormier said.\nThe average price for a single-family detached home in Greater Moncton stood at $197,600 in December 2019, up 4.6 per cent from a year before and 18.9 from five years earlier.\nCormier said while the association representing realtors doesn't have firm data, anecdotally they're seeing a lot of people moving from more expensive markets in Canada.\u00a0\nA home selling for about $200,000 here would sell for about $1 million or more in Oakville, Ont., she said.\u00a0\n\"A lot of people are coming back home, a lot of people are retiring here, a lot of people coming here to start a family,\" Cormier said. \"We have a better quality of life, we see a lot of immigration and our employment is pretty steady.\"\nBut rising prices and increasing rents also make the city less affordable for those with a low income. Moncton has struggled to deal with people who are homeless.\nLisa Ryan with the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee told CBC in December that there needs to be a stronger push to build more affordable housing.\u00a0\n\"When we see developments coming into our community, or no policies attached to that, we need to get brave at saying this is wrong,\" Ryan said.\u00a0\nOn Monday, Moncton council ratified a new policy to be implemented later this year that could allow developments with affordable housing to move through the city's approval process faster.\nThe decline in vacancy rates isn't limited to residential housing.\u00a0\nIan Franklin, a vice-president with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Atlantic, said\u00a0the office space vacancy rate downtown is\u00a0\"quite low,\" around four per cent.\n\"There's obviously a need for more office (space) downtown,\" he said. But he said he's not aware of any firm plans for new office buildings over the next two years.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Homeless moms vow to keep fighting after being forcibly evicted from vacant Oakland house", "description": "Moving into the house was 'an act of desperation,' says evicted woman Dominique Walker", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5426388/homeless-moms-vow-to-keep-fighting-after-being-forcibly-evicted-from-vacant-oakland-house-1.5428023", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5428025.1579112979!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/2486372.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 5:43 PM ET", "2020-01-15T22:43:39.709Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Dominique Walker says she was forced out of the home where her son took his first steps so a private company can profit from\u00a0her city's housing crisis.\nWalker is one of several homeless mothers who were evicted Tuesday from a vacant house on\u00a0Magnolia Street in\u00a0Oakland, Calif., which they'd been living\u00a0since November.\u00a0\n\"My son took his first steps in the house on Magnolia Street.

Frankly, those commitments have not yet been made from them, but that's my job.\"\u00a0\nThe electric bus idea also\u00a0hasn't come to council, and three councillors have already brought a motion\u00a0asking city staff to pursue options for \"higher order\" transit in the west end, an area of high growth and increasing traffic.\nHolder said Wednesday that electrifying the fleet and considering other transit options for the west end are \"two different issues.\"\u00a0\nHolder said the electric buses could be acquired over a 10-year period as the diesel buses reach the end of their service life.\u00a0\nDuring his speech Holder highlighted what he sees as London's success over the past year.\u00a0\nHe said job creation remains his top focus, followed by transportation and helping the city's most vulnerable.\u00a0\nOn the jobs front, Holder said the city has added 7,700 net new jobs, pointing to the success of the new website LondonJobsNow.ca which has had 1,000 unique visitors every month since launching in June.\u00a0\nHe pointed out that more jobs will come when Maple Leaf Foods opens next year (1,500 jobs) and the new Gateway Casinos location in southwest London (700 jobs).\u00a0\nHolder touted the creation of a Housing Stability Action Plan and the Core Area Action Plan to address problems of homelessness in a city where about 200 people sleep on the streets each night.\u00a0\nAnd while those measures come at a high cost, Holder said both are necessary.\u00a0\n\"We cannot afford inaction\u00a0because the cost of that, both financially and morally, far outweighs\u00a0the cost of what's being proposed,\" he said.\nHolder also pointed to Carepoint, the new name of the city's supervised consumption site, as a key part of the city's response to problems linked to addiction and drug use.\u00a0\nHe said since Carepoint opened in a temporary location at 186 King St., it's handled\u00a0more than 2,000 referrals to health care supports and other social services.\u00a0\n\"Carepoint doesn't just save money, it saves lives,\" he said.\u00a0\nHolder also said he expects Carepoint's planned permanent location at 446 York St. will open this year. In November, a decision by the province's Land Planning Appeal Tribunal cleared the way for the permanent site to go ahead, pending another possible appeal.\u00a0\nHolder said Wednesday he's optimistic the province will back the location and provide permanent funding, after health ministry officials originally supported making the King Street site permanent.\u00a0\nHolder also praised how the city responded to the Aug. 14 explosion on Woodman Avenue in East London which led to the evacuation of about 100 homes.\nHe gave first responders and city services high marks for their response, but also said stories of neighbours helping neighbours was inspiring.\u00a0\n\"There was no loss of life, only a community brought to life,\" he said. \"There were countless stories of heroism, kindness and compassion.

It asks that economy, or public fares, make up around 50 per cent of the seats each week.\u00a0\n\"This ticket is expected to be the least costly ticket but also offers the least extra services,\" the tender reads. \"It is anticipated that this ticket fare will allow Nunavummiut to be able to travel at a more affordable rate.\"\u00a0\nDuty travel is the next level\u00a0and medical travel is the highest cost ticket, but it offers the most flexibility.\u00a0\nA 2019-2020 business plan for Economic Development and Transportation also says\u00a0including the cost of public airfare in its contract\u00a0means \"a significant reduction in the cost of air travel has been realized for much of Nunavut's travelling public\".\nAkeeagok said\u00a0he is proud of the\u00a0change.

The Alberta average is 36 per cent.\nIn Edmonton Centre, 19 per cent of renters spend half or more of their income on rent.\u00a0\nKatherine Swampy, running for the NDP, said people don't just need housing they can afford.

Instead, their policy focuses on putting home purchases within reach for more Canadians.\u00a0\nThat includes taking another look at the financial stress test for first-time buyers, and extending CMHC-backed mortgages from 25 to 30 years.\nCBC was unable to interview Cumming, the Edmonton Centre CPC candidate, despite numerous attempts to contact his campaign.\nBoissonnault said a second-term Liberal government would continue on its current path.\n\"A re-elected Liberal government will do exactly what we demonstrated we were serious about in the first mandate, which is to continue the national housing strategy \u2014\u00a0$55 billion over 10 years to house 530,000 Canadians,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhile the need is great, getting an affordable housing project to fruition is a complicated undertaking, involving funding from three levels of government.\u00a0\nAli's townhouse was built by Edmonton non-profit Right At Home Housing Society in partnership with the Westmount Presbyterian Church, which is leasing the land for a small amount of money.\nRight at Home spent $2 million of its own money, which included some donations. The province kicked in $4 million. The only federal money for\u00a0the project was $10,000 in seed funding from CMHC.\nFederal grants depend on matching funds from provincial and municipal governments.\nGovernments also look for \"shovel-ready\" projects so organizations like Right At Home have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on land, permits, and designs\u00a0before getting\u00a0any funds.\nAnne Stevenson, director of strategic initiatives with Right At Home, said that means there needs to be a lot of coordination.\u00a0\nShe said the federal government could make it easier for groups like hers by giving direct grants.\n\"Being able to streamline that process for our organization would really help up bring more product online,\" Stevenson said.\u00a0\nShe said the government could also set aside surplus federal land for affordable housing.\nCurrent funding is tied to brand-new projects, but Stevenson said the federal government should consider offering grants for non-profits to buy existing buildings to turn into affordable housing.\u00a0\n\"We find the costs per unit typically tends to be a bit lower and it's a great way to be providing affordable housing in all neighbourhoods where land might be scarce.\"\nBefore she was accepted into affordable housing seven years ago, Ali had a hard time finding a place she could afford.\u00a0 She lived for a while in an affordable housing project along 107th Avenue but didn't feel it was safe for her children.\n\"Finding housing was quite difficult because I was only one income working at the time, so whatever I make almost would go to my rent,\" she said.\nEdmonton Centre candidates for the Oct. 21 federal election:\n"}, {"author": "Jason Vermes", "title": "Boomers, once critical of millennials, are more sympathetic to their housing plight, says professor", "description": "Parents 'recognize that their kids have it really different getting on the property ladder,' says Nancy Worth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/boomers-once-critical-of-millennials-are-more-sympathetic-to-their-housing-plight-says-professor-1.5203404", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4906657.1587666422!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/crea-home-sales-20180413.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 08, 2019 12:30 PM ET", "2019-07-08T20:58:04.947Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Rebecca Goldstone calls herself a \"1 per cent millennial.\" Thanks to financial support from her parents, she graduated in 2016 without debt and landed a full-time job in Toronto soon after.\nNow a freelancer in commercial film, the work is steady.

(Utilities were included in rent figures because the data didn't allow for costs to be separated out, according to the index.)\n\"These numbers clearly demonstrate why Canadians and housing advocates have been calling on our political leaders to take more immediate action to address the affordability challenges impacting so many families and individuals across the country,\" said Jill Atkey, CEO of the BC Non-Profit Housing Association, in a news release.\n\"Whichever party forms the next government will need to increase the investments into the National Housing Strategy in order to achieve its goals before this crisis gets even worse.\"\nOf the ridings identified in the index, Willowdale in Toronto\u00a0was the\u00a0worst for rental affordability;\u00a039 per cent of renters there reported spending half or more of their income toward rent.\nCBC News has identified five swing ridings\u00a0on StatsCanada's top-20 list for costly housing: Richmond Hill, King-Vaughan,\u00a0Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and\u00a0Don Valley North in Ontario; and\u00a0Burnaby North-Seymour in B.C.\nThe other Ontario ridings on the list are:\nIn British Columbia:\nRounding out the list are\u00a0Ville-Marie-Le Sud Ouest-\u00cele-des-Soeurs\u00a0in Quebec, Halifax in Nova Scotia and Winnipeg South in Manitoba.\u00a0\nThe crisis of affordability in some markets hasn't been lost on campaigning party leaders.

In terms of overcrowding and overspending, the hardest hit immigrant-led households are in the Greater Toronto Area, with 55 to 60 per cent of those households in Richmond Hill, Vaughan and Markham spending 30 per cent or more of their income on rent.\nBut those suburbs still might be the more affordable option for those looking to own\u00a0a home in Toronto\u00a0\u2014 people like new mom Jessica Botello.\nBotello said she's encouraged by Trudeau's housing proposal but thinks ultimately it's better suited to those looking outside the city core.\n\"Honestly, it's a great idea, but for $800,000, it's not realistic for Toronto,\" she told CBC Radio's\u00a0Metro Morning.\nBotello recently put in an offer for a home in Toronto, only to find six others did as well. Ultimately, the home sold for $840,000\u00a0\u2014 a price she said she simply couldn't compete with.\n\"We were pre-approved for $745,000,\" she told\u00a0Metro Morning.\u00a0\"But if it's listed for that price, they want multiple offers\u00a0\u2014 and they get them.\"\nWhat matters to you this\u00a0election?

Some had been homeless in the past, escaped violent relationships or survived childhood abuse.\u00a0\n\"You hear about this idea of invisibility,\" O'Neil told CBC's Information Morning. \"This sort of recurring theme of feeling disconnected.\u2026 One woman actually said, you know, my expiry date has come and gone.\"\nO'Neil said\u00a0some of the\u00a0women told her that they don't feel safe where they live.\u00a0\n\"So not feeling safe in the neighbourhood, having ongoing conflict with the neighbours, feeling threatened or challenged by landlords, or made uncomfortable by landlords or property owners,\" O'Neil said.\u00a0\nStill, she was surprised that so many found a way\u00a0to make a bad living situation better.\u00a0\n\"It shows the resourcefulness of women in dealing with really less than ideal \u2014 far less than ideal \u2014 circumstances, but also really draws attention to why should they have to be resourceful?\" said O'Neil.\nO'Neil's work is especially needed now that Halifax is in the middle of an affordability crisis, said\u00a0Claudia Jahn, director of community housing development with the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia.\u00a0\nShe also advised O'Neil on her thesis.\nThe rental vacancy rate in Halifax is at a record low 1.6 per cent, and the provincial NDP has called for action now that 20 per cent of households\u00a0spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent and utilities.\nShe said finding adequate housing isn't just a problem for older women.\nFor those with children, it can be\u00a0especially hard to find an affordable place to live, she said.\u00a0\nThe stigma is such a problem that the\u00a0Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission issued a warning this summer to landlords who refused to rent to families with children.\n\"Women with children are less mobile than men are because they are bound by a school district and don't want to move their children. So they are always tied to that community,\" she said.\u00a0\nSome women\u00a0might stay in a dangerous housing situation for the sake of their children, Jahn added.\n\"They don't want to uproot the children out of their schools, circle of friends, relatives. So making that step into a shelter is really the last, last resort.\"\nJahn has been working on housing affordability across the province since\u00a02003, and said things have only gotten worse as public housing deteriorates\u00a0and rental prices soar.\nAll the while new affordable buildings aren't being put up\u00a0fast enough, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Tweaking the system just a little bit here and there isn't really doing any justice for the severity of the issue,\" Jahn said.\u00a0\nBoth O'Neil and Jahn say for too long people tasked with creating more, and better, affordable housing\u00a0don't engage with the people who actually need it.\u00a0\nThat's the idea behind Home for Good, a joint project by Alice House, the Elizabeth Fry Society, the Marguerite Centre and YWCA Halifax. The three-year initiative\u00a0looks at the barriers women face once they leave supportive\u00a0housing programs.\nIn 2017, the groups interviewed 22 women between the ages of 19 and 60.\nWhat they found, said project manager Charlene Gagnon, is that the province needs an approach to housing that recognizes the needs of women as different from the needs of men.\n\"The programs that don't apply that gender lens, they really don't take into account things like women's economic security, being the leaders of single-income\u00a0households with children and histories of trauma,\" said Gagnon,\u00a0who travelled to Edmonton earlier this month to share the groups'\u00a0work at the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness.\nThe project will officially wrap up in January 2020, but Gagnon said the work is really just beginning.\nThe non-profits are now developing next steps, like credit counselling programs for women and online training for landlords to better understand what women renters face.\u00a0\nLike O'Neil, the researchers used animation\u00a0to share the participants' stories.\u00a0\n\"These are women who've worked really hard to go through programs,\" Gagnon said. \"They're told in their programming to be proud of where they come from and be proud of who they are, and then when they go tell their stories to landlords that actually becomes a barrier to them.\"\n\"That stigma is really alive and well in the province, and it's traumatizing in itself.\"\u00a0\nO'Neil's\u00a0creative approach to her research earned her the best thesis of the year at her university.\nBut for her, the real victory will be seeing her work translate into action.\u00a0\n\"I hope this would at the very least just generate an awareness that these women exist and are among us and have been huge parts of community life that maybe we don't value enough,\" she said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Scott Dippel ", "title": "Calgary pulling together list of projects for life after pandemic", "description": "Nenshi says governments are interested in creating jobs, getting economy moving when crisis is done", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/city-council-infrastructure-pandemic-1.5519916", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5498825.1584337662!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-nenshi-20191121.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 02, 2020 5:38 PM MT", "2020-04-02T23:38:27.683Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Calgary's mayor says it's no secret the city's economy will need a boost when the COVID-19 pandemic passes \u2014 and he wants city hall to be ready to roll.\nNaheed Nenshi told city council's intergovernmental affairs committee on Thursday that the city is pulling specific projects from its unfunded infrastructure list so it has a list of items that are ready to go.\nHe said other orders of government are looking for post-pandemic ways to immediately create jobs and get the economy moving again.\nThe need is particularly acute in Calgary, which Nenshi said has been ravaged by the pandemic, by the recent oil price crash on global markets and the fact the city has yet to fully recover from the 2015 recession.\nWhile he wouldn't get too specific about what's on the list or how much it might be worth, Nenshi said the city should\u00a0talk about how much cash the federal and provincial governments might be willing to offer.\n\"It's a question of how much money the other orders of government want to spend.

are very worried about their economic future,\" Nenshi said.\n\"Those are the sorts of things that we're really pushing forward to the other orders of government.\"\nThe city has no room to move beyond its budgeted capital program.\nThe mayor said the pandemic has resulted in a drop in revenues and it's spending more on unbudgeted items.\nUnlike the federal and provincial governments, the city cannot run a deficit.\nHe estimates the pandemic is costing the city up to $15 million a week.\u00a0\nNenshi is holding out hope that the province will allow the city to run a one-time deficit or that there will be some kind of bailout package put together for Alberta's municipalities.\nHe said there is no capacity to raise taxes during this economic crisis to help balance the books.\n"},

Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors.\n\"It's like hot weather and hot market,\" KWAR president Brian Santos said.\u00a0\n\"Typically speaking, our summer's usually a little bit more quiet, but it's been a really, really busy and active market.\"\nOverall,\u00a0586 residential properties were sold in July, for an increase of 15.1 per cent relative to July 2018.\nSales numbers in July varied by property type, which Santos said is because of increasing demand for homes at a price point of under $600,000.\nTownhouse sales\u00a0were up by 45.1 per cent\u00a0and detached home sales\u00a0were up by 16.4 per cent.\nIn comparison, condominium sales were down by 6.1 per cent and sales of semi-detached homes were down by 22.2 per cent.\n\"Demand continues to be really, really high and supply is low,\" Santos said, noting that KWAR typically has about 1,500 listings at a time, but that right now they have just over 800.\n\"So just over half our typical inventory levels, and I think that's really driving the market,\" he said.\nHomebuyers in Kitchener-Waterloo can\u00a0expect to pay more than they did last year, no matter what kind of property they're in the market for.\nThe average sale price of a home in Kitchener-Waterloo rose to\u00a0$521,101 this month, an increase of\u00a0to\u00a09.3 per cent\u00a0compared to July 2018.\nThe steepest price hikes were for townhouses \u2014 which sold for an average of $414,062, up 17 per cent over last year \u2014 and apartment-style condos, which sold at an average of $339,137, up 15.9 per cent.\nSemi-detached homes sold at an average $434,136, up 11.9 per cent over last year.\u00a0\nDetached homes, the most expensive property category of all, sold at an average $613,244, up 5.4 per cent over last year.\nSantos said\u00a0rising demand and rising prices are a natural consequence of increasing demand for homes in Kitchener-Waterloo, especially as more buyers move to the region from the Toronto area.\n\"More and more people are choosing it as a place to live, and there's just not a lot of inventory out there in the market, so I think that's what's really driving these prices upwards,\" he said, noting that buyers he works with often compete with multiple offers.\u00a0\nThe association's \"month's supply of homes for sale\" figure\u00a0stood at 1.7 months in July, 15 per cent lower than the same period last year.\nThat means if no new homes were to hit the market, inventory would run out in a period of 1.7 months, Santos said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Feds, Alberta set to clash over cash for

"source": null, "content": "Alberta is pushing back against the Trudeau Liberals' expectation that provinces and territories pick up half the cost of a new rent supplement, asking instead to substitute federal funding for their own.\nThe promised supplement was originally proposed as a joint funding venture between the federal and provincial governments.\nBut in negotiations over the funding arrangement, Alberta officials have sought to have their existing spending count towards the cost-matching approach instead of increasing funding as other provinces have said they would.\nThe details of the behind-the-scenes talks were provided to The Canadian Press by multiple people with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity, either because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss federal work, or to ensure relationships with governments and agencies weren't compromised.\nWhat has housing advocates concerned is that the new supplement may have limited effects if spending doesn't increase as originally envisioned.\nA spokeswoman for Alberta's housing minister says the province hopes to finalize a funding arrangement with Ottawa to streamline provincial rental assistance programs.\n\"We are working with the federal government to reach an agreement under the Canada Housing Benefit to better support Albertans in need of housing and our government hopes to co-ordinate this new federal funding with our rental assistance program,\" said Natalie Tomczak, press secretary to Alberta Housing Minister Josephine Pon.\n\"This will reduce duplication in the application process and ensure Albertans in need of housing can access the supports they need quickly and efficiently.\"\nWhat makes the new rent benefit unusual is that it will be tied to a person, rather than a social housing unit \u2014 meaning tenants won't lose the supplement if they move out of social housing, but rather get to apply it against the rent in a private unit.\nThe supplement is part of the federal Liberals' decade-long housing strategy and is slated to cost $4 billion when accounting for collective spending by federal, provincial and territorial governments.\nThe supplement spending is part of what the parliamentary budget officer has noted is $11.7 billion in cost-matching from provinces and territories contained in the Liberals' housing strategy, which is billed as carrying a $55-billion price tag.\nCost-matching provisions could lead lower levels of government to shift existing funds to meet federal demands without an overall increase in spending, the budget watchdog warned in a report earlier this year.\nPon spoke with her federal counterpart, Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen, on Nov. 28. In a statement at the time, she said that Alberta's \"key unilateral spending commitments\" made as part of \"a sustainable financial framework\" must be treated as cost-matching under the housing strategy.\nThe housing benefit wasn't mentioned by name in the statement.\n\"The federal government must respect how, when and where provinces choose to spend our money in areas of core provincial jurisdiction,\" Pon's statement at the time said.\nEven though the housing benefit is mentioned in deals provinces and territories signed with Ottawa to get money through the Liberals' housing strategy, the main agreements didn't contain the fine print about the rent benefit. The Liberals have to sign separate deals for that because the benefit is tailored to fit with each jurisdiction's unique needs and programs.\nThe first such deal was signed with Ontario this month. Each side is to put up $730 million over eight years for a $1.46-billion total.\nAt an event in Ottawa announcing the agreement, a Liberal point man on the housing file said different provinces are challenged by different economic constraints, but argued spending a little more on housing could save governments money in the long-term from things like reduced health care costs.\n\"This initiative, small at start, is going to free up other resources to tackle some of the other challenges we have in the housing sector,\" said, Toronto MP Adam Vaughan, Hussen's parliamentary secretary.\nQuebec remains the only province that hasn't signed funding agreement to be part of the national housing strategy, but Vaughan said a deal is close.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Where we live, where we die and the romances we read in between", "description": "From the cost of housing to the cost of dying, with a Valentine look at love in publishing ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/where-we-live-where-we-die-and-the-romances-we-read-in-between-1.5462205", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5462246.1581599369!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/death-romance-and-where-one-lives.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 14, 2020 9:00 AM ET", "2020-02-14T14:00:00.887Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Don't look now, but Canada's housing market is heating up again. \u00a0Prices are jumping across the country, and that is piled on top of Canada's mountain of household debt.\nPaul Haavardsrud looks at whether this renewed froth in real estate is another risk for this country's economy.

It's mid-morning and he's packing it all up. He has to be out of his hotel room by noon.\u00a0\nFive days before, a fire at the Fredericton rooming house where he was living left him and 10 others with no place to go. The Red Cross put him up in a local hotel room, but now the funding has run out.\u00a0\n\"I'm going to go put my stuff in storage and from there I really don't know,\" said Burtch. \"I have no options really.

Spoke to a lady there a little while ago. \u2026 She wanted $1,400 and\u00a0change for a room \u2014 for a room \u2014 that was first and last (month's rent), damage deposit, that's sort of what it cost in the long run.\u00a0\n\"I just can't do that \u2014 I could do it, but I'd probably go hungry.\"\u00a0\nIt's a struggle that has\u00a0become more common across the province. As the vacancy rate goes down and the rents go up, there is less and less affordable housing.\n'I've never felt shame like this in my life': 500 homeless, 5,000 await affordable housing\nAnd many in the province, like Randy Burtch, are just one misfortune away from being homeless.\nThere are 500 people experiencing homelessness in Fredericton, Moncton and Saint John and more than 5,000 households are on a waiting list for a subsidized apartment.\u00a0\nIt's something Brian Duplessis knows all about. He's the president of the board of the Fredericton Homeless Shelters.\nHe works with several organizations to find affordable housing and pushes\u00a0to get more built.\n\"About 10 years ago, there seemed to be an influx of affordable housing and subsidized units being built,\" he said.\u00a0\nSince then the need has grown, but the affordable housing stock hasn't.\n\"There's just such limited availability in Fredericton,\" Duplessis said. \"If you take a look around, almost all of the new apartments, and there's lots of new apartments being built, they're for the middle and upper-income folks who are coming into the city.\"\nIn 2017 in Fredericton, 122 apartment units were built in the city.\nJust two years later, in the first half of this year, 191 new units were started.\u00a0\nBut despite all the\u00a0construction, the vacancy rate in the capital city is still less than two per cent.\u00a0\nIn November, the City of Fredericton took developers, reporters and city staff and councillors on a bus ride to see some of that development.\u00a0\nAt every stop the story was similar \u2014 pricey apartments that were snapped up quickly.\u00a0\nIn a new building on Main Street, 16 one-bedroom apartments were rented within a week at $1,000 a month.\nIn Devon, a new 80-unit Colpitts development called Station House stretches nearly the entire length of the street.\u00a0\nAn indoor pool, gym, rooftop patio, woodworking shop and underground parking are just some of its amenities.\u00a0\nThe building won't be finished until April, but according to Craig McElroy, vice-president at Colpitts Developments, about half the units are already rented at $1,400 to $2,200 a month.\n\"It's clear affordable housing is not a priority here in the city,\" Perry Kendall, CEO of Habitat for Humanity in Fredericton, said after the tour.\u00a0\nWhether it be housing developments, condos or apartments, he\u00a0said every new development is focused on high-end rents and purchase prices.\n\"I feel there absolutely needs to be more of a focus on every aspect of the population\u00a0and there's more and more people,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Whether it be seniors, whether it be the young families, they have very few options and those options are getting worse and worse.\"\u00a0\nThe city recently donated land for the construction of two new affordable housing buildings, which will provide seven units. It's also contributing more than $100,000 to the overall project, a collaborative effort by several community organizations.\u00a0\nKendall said it's a good start, but it still leaves large gaps in the city's housing.\nThe solution?\nIncentives to build affordable housing have\u00a0to come from both the city and the province.\u00a0\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante recently introduced new rules\u00a0that will force developers to include social and affordable housing in all projects of five units or more.\nBut Fredericton's Mayor Mike O'Brien said he doesn't have that authority.\n\"I would love to see that, but we're not allowed to do that by legislation,\" he said.\n\"\u00a0\u2026 That's called inclusionary zoning. For example, you want to build 100 new units, and X amount must be for social housing or affordable rentals. Some other provinces have that legislation. We do not.\"\nErika Jutras, a spokesperson for the Department of Local Government, wouldn't say whether such a regulation\u00a0would be allowed in New Brunswick.\nBut Jutras said there is a tool available to local governments that could provide an incentive to developers.\nShe said municipalities can create what's called a density bonus zoning bylaw. That would give cities the ability to allow more units than would normally be permitted \u2014\u00a0if the developer created affordable housing units.\nA week after packing his belongings and leaving the hotel room, Randy Burtch did find a new place to live.\u00a0\nYou could say he was lucky. He had enough savings to buy a cheap car, which he lived in\u00a0for two nights.\u00a0\n\"I guess most people would probably say it sucks but I don't know, I kind of take things with a grain of salt. You know, it is what it is. I do what I gotta do.\"\nWhen his doctor found out where he was, she brought him blankets and a plate of ribs.\nThen, unexpectedly, a friend came through with a temporary room outside the city centre for $300 a month.\u00a0\n\"We need to build some houses.\"\n"}, {"author": "Sanjay Maru", "title": "Essex man sleeping in scooter after town's order to leave 'hazardous' apartment", "description": "70-year-old struggling with long wait list for affordable housing, rising rental rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/essex-man-facing-homelessness-amid-town-order-to-leave-1.5487810", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5487932.1583954880!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/wdr-john-kobelnak.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 10, 2020 6:00 AM ET", "2020-03-10T12:14:50.756Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "His apartment contains black mould, caved-in ceilings and cracked walls\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet John\u00a0Kobelnak\u00a0is more than happy to\u00a0call it home.\nThe 70-year-old Essex man has taken to sleeping in his electric mobility scooter after being issued an order by the town to immediately vacate his apartment. Now, he has been left to tackle a climate of rising rental rates and long wait lists for affordable housing.\nThe town deemed his apartment \"hazardous to the health and safety\" of people in and around it after complaints prompted an inspection on Feb. 24. The order also applies to the other two apartments on the upper floor and the dining hall on the lower level.\nAs for the landlord, the town's order requires him to \"retain an Ontario Professional Engineer\" who will review\u00a0the building after appropriate fixes have been made\u00a0and submit a report to the town's building department by March 24.\nKobelnak\u00a0has lived in the unit at 18 Talbot Street North for about 12 years \u2014 and said with rental prices rapidly rising and no family in the area, he has nowhere else to go.\n\"You have to go out. You can't stay here. You have to get out now,\" said Kobelnak, recalling the words of the inspectors on Feb. 24.\nHe adds town officials informed him he's allowed to \"come and go\" for\u00a0two weeks from that date to move his belongings out of the unit. For Kobelnak, \"that ain't going to happen\" since he doesn't have the money to afford a storage unit.\n\"Who's going to pay for all that? I can't pay for storage. No way,\" he said, adding town\u00a0officials informed the tenants it would be the landlord's responsibility to provide alternate accommodations. \"We already know he's not going to put us up.\"\nDespite the town's order, most of Kobelnak's belongings remain stuffed in a room with wooden pillars precariously holding up part of the ceiling. That same room also contains a large hole in another part of the ceiling, caked in black mould.\nWhen it's time for bed, the 70-year-old\u00a0said he resorts to sleeping in his electric mobility scooter. But there's one thing that keeps Kobelnak returning to the apartment everyday.\n\"I've got a cat to look after. He's my family. He's like a kid\u00a0\u2014 but he's my kid,\" he said, adding he doesn't have any friends or family in the area who can assist him with finding a proper place to sleep.\nEssex officials said they received one complaint about the building from a tenant back in 2013,\u00a0which concerned \"smaller issues\" that were quickly rectified by the landlord.\nA second complaint was received by the town two weeks before the Feb. 24 inspection. According to the town, \"significant issues in terms of structural framing, access to safe exits, and fire separation between units\" required the building department\u00a0to take swift action.\n\"As the organization responsible for enforcing the Ontario Building Code, we must balance the needs of multiple parties, but the protection of life and safety of the public is our number one priority,\" the town said in a statement to CBC News.\n\"While we understand the frustration of the tenant and difficulty in finding alternative housing, we believe the proper recourse and/or remedy would be a question for the Landlord Tenant Board.\"\nImmediately after receiving the town's order to leave, Kobelnak\u00a0submitted an application for subsidized\u00a0housing to the Windsor-Essex Community Housing Corporation \u2014 which the organization said it has expedited in light of his situation.\nHowever, it still may be \"months\" before Kobelnak makes it to the top of the wait list, according to the city's executive director of housing Debbie Cercone, who points to a 50 per cent increase in the need for affordable housing since 2011.\nAccording to Cercone, the wait list sits just shy of 6,000 people. Of that, more than 400 people have also had their applications expedited like Kobelnak.\n\"We used to be able to turn people around fairly quickly, within weeks,\" she said. \"We are now months and years for wait times.\"\n\"Our one-bedrooms make up about half of the list. The wait can be fairly long for those particular units.\"\nOne option Kobelnak has, she said, is to seek emergency shelter.\u00a0That would require him to relocate to Windsor\u00a0\u2014 specifically, The Salvation Army.\n\"In terms of any other options, we have support agencies in the community that would help individuals who require help in searching for available units,\" said Cercone.\n\"They would be able to work with this gentleman in order to address his needs on the short-term if he required a unit immediately.\"\nNolan Hennin, case work manager at the Essex MPP constituency office, said the number of rental units \u2014 and their values \u2014 on the private market has seen a significant increase throughout the past five years.\n\"I've seen bachelor's [apartments] as high as 1,200 dollars,\" he said, adding affordable housing stock is a \"growing need\" in Essex.\nAccording to Hennin, the majority\u00a0of people who come into the constituency office with housing problems are seniors who have occupied their unit \"for a long time.\"\nThese photos were taken by CBC News during a visit to Kobelnak's apartment on Mar. 5:\n\"An individual is in a building. He's been in there for 20 years and is paying five to six hundred dollars a month rent. Maybe the building gets condemned or somebody wants to sell the building,\" said Hennin. \"All of a sudden they need to find a new place.\"\n\"Then, they look into the market rate and they have to shell out another five to six hundred dollars for their rent.\"\nIn terms of options for people who end up in these situations, Hennin\u00a0said many either stay with family or move into an emergency shelter, adding affordable housing stock is a \"growing need\" in Essex.\u00a0\n\"It's really about what their support network is like. Some people may have access to family who would take them in, whereas other people wouldn't\u00a0\u2014 and then don't really have any other resource than trying to use a shelter service or something along those lines.\"\nKobelnak said his\u00a0main source of income is old age security, which amounts to $1,500. He adds the search for affordable rental properties in Essex is a significant challenge with\u00a0that income.\n\"It's $1,300 for a one-bedroom. Plus, you've got to pay for your heat and hydro,\" said Kobelnak. \"I only get 15 [hundred]. What am I going to eat?\"\nBuilding owner Earl McCormick spoke with CBC News on Friday and acknowledged the ceiling needs to be completely redone. He added a contractor would be called in that same day to start repairing the roof.\n\"I'm hoping they'll have everything fixed where they wouldn't have to leave. It'll be all fixed, say, within a week or so. That way they can stay,\" said McCormick, adding he doesn't believe he bears \"any responsibility\" for the condition of the building.\nWhen asked about Kobelnak's claim that he's only attended the apartment about five times in 12 years, McCormick didn't dispute that. However, he said weather conditions have made it difficult for him to apply fixes.\n\"I've always kept up on everything. You can't very well repair [the roof] ... in the winter. My hands were tied,\" he said.\nMcCormick adds the reason why he hasn't been able to fix the large hole in Kobelnak's storage room that appears to be caked in black mould \u2014 along with a nearby portion of the ceiling being held up by two, wooden planks \u2014 is because there's been\u00a0too much stuff in the way.\n\"I'm getting prices [from contractors] to get it all fixed,\" McCormick told CBC News on Friday.\nAs for Kobelnak, he said all he can do now is take a \"wait and see\" approach, as he considers the possibility of facing legal action for continuing to spend time in his apartment.\n\"I wouldn't wish this on anybody because it sucks. That's the truth of it.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Liberals look at short-term changes to expand rural broadband", "description": "Document is aspirational, doesn't come with any new spending", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/broadband-rural-liberals-1.5192177", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5192187.1566596425!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rural-strategy-20190627.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 27, 2019 11:00 AM ET", "2019-06-27T15:11:02.436Z"], "source": null, "content": "The federal government is promising to piggyback on existing projects and networks as much as possible to expand broadband access to rural communities as part of two reports being made public today.\nOfficials are also looking to rework some programs to make it easier for rural communities to benefit from federal spending as part of the related strategies.\nBut aside from specific targets to connect Canadians to high-speed internet service, the rural strategy is largely without benchmarks.\nRural Economic Development Minister Bernadette Jordan says the aspirational tone of the document reflects concerns from rural communities about a one-size-fits-all approach.\nThe government isn't announcing any new spending, but ways to more efficiently dole out promised cash, including $6 billion worth of plans to connect every household in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.\nJordan says the plans are not designed to help the Liberals in this fall's federal election, but rather reflect the concerns rural Canadians raised during consultations.\n\"We want to make sure going forward that we are addressing those concerns,\" Jordan said in an interview.\n\"In reality, rural communities haven't said, 'We want you to come in and fix our problems.'

He says he needs a roommate to help split the cost of rent.\n\"That's pretty much the only way you can really get by,\" he said.\nAccording to the latest statistics from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Regina was $1,130 in October 2018, compared to $1,116 in October 2017.\u00a0\nThis is mainly due to an abundance of newly constructed rental units that tend to charge more than older units. Newly constructed units have outpaced demand for rent, nudging Regina's vacancy rate from 7 per cent to 7.7 per cent.\nThis elevated vacancy rate has pushed landlords and property managers of older units to lower their rents as they try to compete with new rentals.\nThe CMHC report breaks down what happens if\u00a0you remove newly constructed buildings from the equation.

Either that, or the average price for a house would need to come down\u00a0by half.\n\"These are massive numbers,\" said the report's lead author, Paul Kershaw, who described the numbers as a \"troubling portrait.\"\nThe report said the chasm between money made and money needed\u00a0is widest in B.C. and Ontario, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. The price of a house in the West Coast city is quadruple what any millennial could \"safely\" afford, and triple their\u00a0budgets in the Six.\nIn Vancouver, millennials would need to make $200,400 every year in order to afford the average home.

The authors said it would take 21 years in Toronto.\nThe average time to save a down payment across Canada is 13 years, which is still eight\u00a0years longer than it would have taken in 1976.\nThe problem is also pronounced in Victoria and\u00a0Kelowna\u00a0in B.C., and in Hamilton and Kitchener in Ontario.

Vacancy rates or Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) rental averages? The \"million-dollar line\" for detached homes being at Main, Commercial, or Boundary?\u00a0\nEveryone agreed Vancouver was still in a housing crisis. But nobody could put a set metric to it.\u00a0\nSimon Fraser University\u00a0economist Josh Gordon said ending the crisis isn't the same as Vancouver suddenly becoming affordable to everyone.\u00a0\n\"A return to conditions of 2014 [when home prices were around 10 to 30 per cent lower than they are now]\u00a0would represent the end of the crisis, but it wouldn't represent the\u00a0solution to all our affordability problems,\" Gordon said.\u00a0\u00a0\nA point repeated by University of British Columbia economist Tom Davidoff.\n\"No matter what government does in the long run, Vancouver is going to be an appealing place for people to work, and it's going to be a hard place to build. So affordability is always going to be a problem for government to handle,\" Davidoff said.\nMeanwhile, Central\u00a01\u00a0deputy chief economist\u00a0Bryan Yu said, \"I don't think it's a term I necessarily use because ...\u00a0I can't really define it very easily,\" while B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association CEO Jill Atkey\u00a0provided a more circuitous response.\n\"We can say we're no longer in a crisis when people are no longer experiencing a crisis within the housing system,\" she said.\u00a0\nFun fact of the day: average price of a Greater Vancouver house has increased as much in the past six months as it did from 1980 to 2006.\nEven though the monthly sales statistics are a main\u00a0barometer for talking about the housing market, those surveyed said there are better places to look for determining how much of a crisis the market is in.\u00a0\n\"The rental market is where the affordability issue is most critical,\u00a0because of course low-income people struggle the most with affordability, and they're most prone to be renters rather than owners,\" said Davidoff.\u00a0\nAtkey agreed, and said that while vacancy rates remain low, changes could be on the way, as governments at all three levels have been building rental stock and affordable housing at levels not seen in decades.\u00a0\n\"With every crisis there's a turning point. And I think what's interesting and and in some ways unique here in B.C. is that we are very much at that turning point and the stars are aligning,\" she said.\u00a0\nBut she's hopeful that the end of the crisis\u00a0\u2014 whenever that comes\u00a0\u2014 doesn't mean an end to current government funding and incentives for below-market housing.\u00a0\n\"Once we have it solved I'm really really hoping that we've got enough collective memory to prevent ourselves from getting back here again,\" she said.\u00a0\nAs for James? Her ministry responded to our question asking what defines a housing \"crisis\" and what would constitute a \"balanced\" market, but didn't answer with any specifics\u00a0\u2014 though she did highlight the taxes her government has implemented.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhich makes a certain amount of sense: if you don't define when a problem is solved, you can have maximum flexibility in trying to solve it.\u00a0\u00a0\nOr, as put most famously by Stanford economist Paul Romer, \"a\u00a0crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "'Broken system' favours tenants, says CEO of Ontario Landlords Watch", "description": "Kayla Andrade\u00a0met with Ontario Housing Minister\u00a0Steve Clark late last month", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/broken-system-favours-tenants-says-ontario-landlords-watch-1.5389170", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5389328.1575911131!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kayla-andrade-and-gail-ryder.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 09, 2019 12:06 PM ET", "2019-12-09T17:42:19.698Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Most landlords aren't getting rich on the backs of tenants.

She calls it her retirement plan, but it's not easy.\n\"Even for the price that we bought the sixplex at, it barely covers itself. And that's what the reality is for real estate in Ontario now. Sometimes these properties are not even covering themselves.\"\nAndrade is quick to suggest\u00a0the Residential Tenancies Act and the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) favour tenants.\nShe said the set of rules that govern the landlord-tenant relationship in Ontairo are part of a\u00a0\"broken system.\"\nLate last month, Andrade\u00a0met with a representative of Ontario Housing Minister\u00a0Steve Clark and after combing through the statistics from the LTB\u00a0tribunal, outlined her concerns. Andrade said landlords are filing the bulk of the applications and usually because a tenant hasn't paid their rent.\n\"It's all favoured toward protecting the tenants. A lot of it comes down to giving tenants lots and lots of time\u00a0and allowing them to appeal judgments and also apply for a stay. It ends up prolonging the eviction process,\" said Andrade.\nOn average, Andrade said it takes about five months to resolve an\u00a0LTB case, which often means five months in unpaid rent.\nAndrade\u00a0said with costs going up, some mom and pop\u00a0landlords are struggling to break even. Increases to taxes, insurance and utilities can often outpace what a landlord is legally able to increase the rent by each year.\n\"Every time you put your property taxes up or you're waiving development charges for a developer ... our property taxes go up,\" said Andrade.\u00a0\"So keep putting property taxes up and we have to re-evaluate our rental unit and the price that it's costing us to run that building and that's why you're going to see more rents increasing.\"\n\"But if you keep the cost low to the landlord, then we can keep it low to the tenants,\" Andrade explained.\nGail Ryder owns three properties in London and told London Morning's Rebecca Zandbergen\u00a0she's also frustrated by the restrictions in the legislation. \"We're not allowed to ask for damage deposits and I think that's probably been the biggest challenge for me. Recouping those losses in between tenants. Yes, I understand it is the cost of doing business but to a degree.\"\nRyder admitted it can\u00a0be challenging\u00a0choosing a tenant who receives funds through the Ontario Disability Supports Program or through Ontario Works, \"because there's no recourse for landlords to get their money. So if there's a default in payment, we have to take people to the board to get your money back.\"\nThat's one of the changes Andrade wants the Ontario government to consider. In a document prepared for Housing Minister Steve Clark, she writes, \"Tenants should not be allowed to receive rent money directly instead, the government funded rent program should stipulate that it must be paid to the landlord directly.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/programs/radionoon/are-you-being-priced-out-of-living-in-montreal-1.5174304", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Montreal's Molson brewery to make way for new residential neighbourhood", "description": "Sprawling site to integrate housing, commercial space and community infrastructure billed as 'historic'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/molson-site-consortium-montreal-agreement-1.5163306", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5163334.1559752580!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/moslon-coors.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 05, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-06-05T20:30:30.832Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The landmark\u00a0Molson brewery, a looming presence on Montreal's waterfront for more than two centuries,\u00a0could soon be transformed into a neighbourhood\u00a0with as many as 4,000 homes.\nMayor Val\u00e9rie Plante\u00a0called the proposed deal with a consortium of developers \"historic.\"\nPlante said the developers won't get the green light\u00a0without first ensuring space is set aside for a school, community centre, public park, waterfront promenade\u00a0and 200 social housing units.\n\"When we think about the city of the future, we want it like that, exactly like that,\" Plante said at Wednesday's meeting of the city's executive committee.\u00a0\nThe sprawling\u00a0site, the equivalent of nearly 11 CFL football fields, runs north of the St. Lawrence River to\u00a0Notre-Dame Street, between Panet Street and Papineau Avenue.\u00a0\nIt is part of what will be dubbed the\u00a0Quartier\u00a0des\u00a0faubourgs, which also includes the new\u00a0Maison\u00a0Radio-Canada building going up just north of the\u00a0Molson\u00a0site\u00a0and the existing tower, which is to be transformed into new offices and housing.\nUnder the agreement, the consortium of Groupe S\u00e9lection and Groupe Montoni will acquire part of the land, while giving the rest to Montreal for development into public infrastructure.\nThe deal still needs to be approved by city council.

There was a requirement that the properties needed to be renovated or demolished within three years of purchase, and for those who didn't renovate, homeowners would get money-back incentives.\nHomes were priced for what was owed to the town in property taxes. The price tag at the time was anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 per\u00a0lot.\nFaro's population has grown since then. As of June, the population was at 419 people.

This growth has come in response to record low vacancy rates and a tight housing market that has seen prices rise 38.5 per cent in Charlottetown in the last two years.\nBut Ndoro said his analysis shows there are already too many homes being built on P.E.I., which will lead to a supply and demand mismatch.\n\"Currently there's an excess of housing starts,\" he said.\n\"When deviations between actual and fundamental levels are high or positive, this gets resolved very quickly in the short term, and that's by housing starts declining.\"\nCMHC's housing market outlook, released last week, projects as many as\u00a01,700 housing starts in 2019.

For example, said\u00a0Ndoro, people are marrying later in life and that also affects forming a household.\nWhile the number of new homes being built on P.E.I. is projected to peak in 2019, Canada as a whole peaked in 2017. Ndoro said that is because housing markets don't operate the same across the board.\n\"In the past few years Atlantic Canada has actually been at polar opposites in what is happening in the rest of the country, and affordability is one of the key factors,\" Ndoro said.\nWhen other areas in Canada become unaffordable, more people tend to choose Atlantic Canada because it is often more affordable, he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Montreal's Molson brewery to make way for new residential neighbourhood", "description": "Sprawling site to integrate housing, commercial space and community infrastructure billed as 'historic'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/molson-site-consortium-montreal-agreement-1.5163306", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5163334.1559752580!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/moslon-coors.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 05, 2019 4:00 PM ET", "2019-06-05T20:30:30.832Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The landmark\u00a0Molson brewery, a looming presence on Montreal's waterfront for more than two centuries,\u00a0could soon be transformed into a neighbourhood\u00a0with as many as 4,000 homes.\nMayor Val\u00e9rie Plante\u00a0called the proposed deal with a consortium of developers \"historic.\"\nPlante said the developers won't get the green light\u00a0without first ensuring space is set aside for a school, community centre, public park, waterfront promenade\u00a0and 200 social housing units.\n\"When we think about the city of the future, we want it like that, exactly like that,\" Plante said at Wednesday's meeting of the city's executive committee.\u00a0\nThe sprawling\u00a0site, the equivalent of nearly 11 CFL football fields, runs north of the St. Lawrence River to\u00a0Notre-Dame Street, between Panet Street and Papineau Avenue.\u00a0\nIt is part of what will be dubbed the\u00a0Quartier\u00a0des\u00a0faubourgs, which also includes the new\u00a0Maison\u00a0Radio-Canada building going up just north of the\u00a0Molson\u00a0site\u00a0and the existing tower, which is to be transformed into new offices and housing.\nUnder the agreement, the consortium of Groupe S\u00e9lection and Groupe Montoni will acquire part of the land, while giving the rest to Montreal for development into public infrastructure.\nThe deal still needs to be approved by city council.

Let's start to brand Calgary as \"North America's Family Friendly City.\"\u00a0It is our sweet spot!\nRecently, I sold two very cool Bob lounge chairs\u00a0on Kijiji (which I had previously purchased on Kijiji) to a Calgary newcomer who had just bought a new house in Airdrie with two living rooms\u00a0\u2014 a fact he shared with me several times.\nAfter we loaded the first chair into the back of his new Kia Telluride, with his young daughter sleeping in the back seat, I had to ask, \"What brought you to Calgary?\"\u00a0\nHe told me he and his wife were living in a small flat in Paris with two children and another on the way and decided they needed to live somewhere more family friendly.\nHe smiled and said, \"We were living the good life in Paris, but realized we needed more room.\"\u00a0\n\"Why Calgary?\" I asked.\nIt turns out these two IT professionals, born in Cameroon, picked Calgary because they could get a good paying job in their profession\u00a0as well as a big house and a big vehicle to get around in.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen the light bulb went on!\u00a0\nCalgary shouldn't be focusing on trying to attract the young-and-hip\u00a0tech worker, looking for big city culture and nightlife. We should be trying to attract the 30-something tech workers who are looking to settle down and raise a family.\u00a0\nCalgary needs to play to its strengths.\u00a0\nWhile Calgary is the fifth most livable city in the world (The Economist 2019 survey), it probably isn't in the top 50 (maybe 100) of the most exciting places to live for young entrepreneurs.\nI am betting Amsterdam, Austin, Berlin, New York, Barcelona, Paris, London, San Francisco, Melbourne, Sydney, Seoul, Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal enter their minds\u00a0long before Calgary. If Calgary ever does.\nIronically, as I was researching family-friendly cities for this piece, a German relocation service called Movinga published its Best Cities for Families 2020 findings that ranked 150 cities around the world. Calgary was ranked eighth.\nNot surprisingly, the top 10 was dominated by northern European cities, but a big surprise was Quebec City coming in at No. 2, just behind Helsinki.\u00a0Montreal finished ninth and Ottawa 14th. Neither Toronto nor Vancouver made it into the top 20.\u00a0\nCalgary ranked high in several of the 13 factors Movinga measured: affordability, education, air quality and neighbourhood safety.\u00a0Our high unemployment rate hurt us, as did children's activities, which surprised me.\nOne of the biggest barriers to raising a family in many cities is housing affordability.\u00a0\nSo, rather than talking up our new library, music museum, bike lanes or festivals, Calgary should be promoting the fact that you can buy an 1,800-square-foot house just minutes from downtown,\u00a0for under $500,000 US, or an even bigger house in the suburbs for the same price. This is unheard of in Vancouver, San Francisco, New York or London.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to renting, a small one-bedroom apartment rents for $3,400 US in San Francisco or New York City \u2014 if you can find one.\nYou could get a $450,000, three-year fixed mortgage in Calgary for about $1,800 US per month, which would be an annual saving of $19,000 a year.\u00a0Or you could get a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in Sodo (the shiny new 35-storey residential building on 10th Avenue in the Beltline) for about $2,000 Cnd. or $1,523 US per month, and pocket $1,900 per month, or $22,800 per year.\u00a0\nAnd yes, we should quote value in US dollars. Not only does it make our housing look more affordable, it also makes it easier for internationals to understand.\nAccording to a\u00a0study done by Zoocasa, based on December 2018 data, the most affordable North American\u00a0cities were:\nYes, Calgary is No. 1.\nSecond on the list of what makes Calgary attractive to parents is our average commute time: 26 minutes.\u00a0Compared with 68 minutes in San Francisco or 74 minutes in London or 43 minutes in New York City, this is a great selling feature for parents of a young family.\nCalgary is a great place for families to live because it is clean and safe, relative to other big cities. Also, our schools and health-care facilities are attractive and inexpensive, when you compare them to most other cities. Plus Calgary has one of the most child-friendly (read, fun-looking) hospitals in the world. Yet I can't recall ever seeing the Alberta Children's Hospital in a promotional video.\u00a0\nUNICEF's \"Child-Friendly Cities\" initiative encourages cities around the world to consider the perspectives, needs and interests of children when making decisions and developing policies and programs.\nAmong its key points, the initiative calls for children to \"live in a safe, secure and clean environment with access to green spaces,\" and to \"meet friends and have places to play and enjoy themselves.\" Hey \u2014 that's Calgary.\nDid you know that every Calgarian is within a five-minute walk to a park?\nYes, Calgary is blessed with over 5,600 parks and open spaces, as well as 1,000 kilometres of pathways, over 100 dog parks (dogs are a big part of family life these days) and 1,000 city playgrounds (that's about five per community, and that doesn't include school playgrounds).\u00a0\nAnd our modern recreation centres offer a plethora of programs and activities that makes them a welcoming gathering place for people of all ages and backgrounds.\nWhile some might say Calgary isn't family friendly because it is so car-oriented, I would argue most international families would love the fact that they can own a car and drive their kids to places, rather than using crowded transit or cycling \u2014 especially in the middle of winter.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while it is legitimate to lament Calgary's car dominated culture, Calgary drivers are some of the most pedestrian-friendly in the world. There are not many cities where drivers routinely stop and let families cross the street (walking or cycling).\nCalgary is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in North America, making it an attractive place for international families looking to raise a family in a welcoming society.\nBack in 2002, Richard Florida wrote a book called The Rise and Fall of the Creative Class.\u00a0His premise was that, in the 21st century, young creative professionals would choose where they wanted to live and work based on how bohemian, gay-friendly and ethnically diverse a city was.\nThe creative class included everyone from software engineers to dancers, from IT professionals to chefs.\nFlorida argued it would be the employees, not the corporations, who would determine what cities would thrive in the 21st century, as companies would move to cities where their employees wanted to live, or were already living, to avail themselves of the knowledge workers they needed.\nWe saw this exact situation play out when Amazon was determining where it would locate its second headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorida created several indexes (bohemian, diversity, talent, gay) to help cities identify their strengths and weaknesses in attracting the creative class. Soon cities around the world were scrambling to see how they measured up and trying to determine how they could get themselves a higher ranking.\u00a0\nWhat Florida missed was the \"family friendly\" index.\u00a0\nWhat happens when the 20-somethings reach their 30s? Most of them pair up and start raising families, which means they start thinking about a house instead of an apartment, a mortgage instead of rent, a car instead of transit or a bike, and schools and playgrounds\u00a0rather than bars and festivals.\u00a0\u00a0\nPerhaps Calgary Economic Development should adopt the moniker, \"Calgary: The Family Friendly City\" or maybe \"The Family Fun City,\" as we try to diversify our economy.\nAnd how about including more families having fun in our promotional videos, rather than the young and restless.\u00a0\nJust a thought.\nThis column is an opinion.

So what will the city get back from Justin Trudeau now that he's forming a minority government?\nIn a campaign marked by scandals, from revelations of Trudeau wearing blackface to questions over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer's dual Canada-U.S. citizenship, policy issues took a backseat to finger-pointing over the gaffes and foibles of party leaders.\u00a0\nBut against that backdrop, Trudeau did make sweeping pledges on issues of critical importance to Toronto residents and city officials.\n\"His campaign promised to continue investing in transit expansion in Toronto, in affordable housing, and in kids and families as an important element in addressing the roots of gun violence \u2014 three important priorities for our City,\" said Mayor John Tory in a statement on Monday night.\nOn the housing front, and likely of interest to residents in an area where rent is sky-high and the average house price is more than $800,000, Trudeau's incoming government plans to offer first-time home-buyer subsidies of 10 per cent on new home purchases and five\u00a0per cent on resale homes, with certain restrictions.\nThe Liberals also hope\u00a0to build 100,000 affordable homes over a decade\u00a0\u2014 a goal that's five times smaller than was proposed by the NDP under\u00a0Jagmeet Singh.\nWhile the New Democrats only won 24 seats, Coun. Mike Layton\u00a0\u2014\u00a0son of the party's late former federal leader Jack Layton\u00a0\u2014 hopes the minority scenario allows the party to encourage bolder action from Trudeau's ranks.\n\"We've got two parties there that are going to want to outdo one another, and hopefully what that will mean is they'll get together and work out a scenario so that we can see money activated quickly in Toronto for affordable housing,\" he said.\nThe \"easiest\" thing the Liberals could do out of the gate to get shovels in the ground, Tory said on Tuesday morning, would be to quickly make parcels of federally owned land available for housing projects.\n\"At my request, they've done an inventory, not just in Toronto but across the country ... I think this will be something they'll get strong support on from the New Democratic Party,\" he added.\nMore money could also start flowing through the Liberal's National Housing Strategy, a 10-year plan that\u00a0includes the $4-billion Canada Housing Benefit, which the federal government previously said would provide an average rent subsidy of $2,500 annually beginning in April 2020.\u00a0\n\"We'll have to make sure they keep their word on that,\" Tory warned.\nOn the transit file, the Liberals promised an additional $3 billion in public transit funding each year. And a big Toronto-specific pledge came late in the campaign: investment in the city's transit priorities.\nThe announcement came the same day Tory and provincial officials revealed a potential agreement on the transit front, with council poised to back Premier Doug Ford's Ontario Line\u00a0in exchange for the province scrapping plans to take over the entire subway system.\u00a0\nAnnounced back in April, the proposed transit line\u00a0is set to run from Ontario Place, across the downtown core, and\u00a0up to the Ontario Science Centre. Longer than the city's in-motion plans for a long-awaited downtown relief line, the route\u00a0would cost close to $11 billion to build, the province says.\n\"This agreement that we see is a good omen, and the Liberals' commitment to public transit, stated in the last [term], should materialize in getting things built here,\" said Ryerson University professor Murtaza Haider.\nThough the Ontario Line route has stirred controversy over potential delays, amid questions about whether the proposal is feasible from the Liberals and others, Tory expressed hope that he'll be able to facilitate discussion between both higher levels of government.\n\"It's my job to bring them both to the table to help build transit,\" he said.\nGun violence in Toronto has also been a key issue, with hundreds of shootings recorded annually, and it's also an area where the Liberals focused some of their campaign energy.\nThe federal government previously introduced\u00a0Bill C-71, expanding firearm background checks, and\u00a0rolled out more gun-control policies\u00a0mid-campaign\u00a0with a promise to ban semi-automatic assault-style rifles.\nThe party also pledged to give cities more power to restrict or ban handguns. It's a move welcomed by Tory, who\u00a0said \"considerable\" additional investment in neighbourhoods and families\u00a0will also be crucial to preventing violence.\u00a0\nThe question now is how many of the promises potentially affecting Toronto will become a reality\u00a0\u2014 since a minority parliament could create some hurdles for Trudeau, and lead voters\u00a0back to the polls sooner than they'd like.\n\"It's going to be more difficult for the Liberals to put forward their agenda going forward,\" said University of Toronto political science professor Andrew McDougall.\u00a0\n\"So we're going to have to see what the other parties think about those priorities.\"\n"}, {"author": "Isaac Olson", "title": "'Now is the time for action,' says Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante, as Montreal vacancy rate hits 15-year low", "description": "Tenants' advocates worry critical housing shortage will lead to 'renters finding\u00a0themselves on the streets'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-low-rental-housing-rates-1.5428726", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3510284.1544202334!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/moving-day-scavengers-20140701.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 16, 2020 4:30 AM ET", "2020-01-16T09:30:00.414Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Montreal is running dangerously low on available rental housing, and\u00a0the city's mayor is calling on both Quebec and Canada to help.\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) released its rental market report Wednesday, showing the city's rental vacancy rate is the lowest it's been in 15 years \u2014 1.5 per cent.\u00a0\n\"Now is the time for action,\" Montreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante tweeted in response to the CMHC findings.\nThe city will continue to work with the federal and provincial governments to find solutions, as they have an \"important role to play in the area of housing, in particular so that investments in social and affordable housing are quickly confirmed,\" she said.\nShe said the administration is \"working tirelessly to develop housing adapted to the needs and budget of Montrealers ... but we cannot do everything alone.\"\nLe taux d\u2019inoccupation des logements locatifs dans la grande r\u00e9gion de Montr\u00e9al a atteint 1,5 % en 2019, r\u00e9v\u00e8le la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SCHL_ca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SCHL_ca</a>.

In 2019, 8,500 new units were added to the city's rental stock \u2014 1,000 more than in 2018.\nWith a record number of people migrating to the region, nearly every available apartment is occupied, especially in boroughs\u00a0such as the Sud-Ouest and Verdun, where the vacancy rate has dropped\u00a0as low as 0.5 per cent.\nApartments with three bedrooms or more are in the highest demand, with an average monthly rent hovering around $1,070 per month and a vacancy rate of 0.7 per cent.\nAnd things aren't looking much better off-island, as the vacancy rate in the suburbs has dropped to 1.2 per cent.\nThe rise in housing prices has also played a role, as fewer people under 35 are buying properties.\u00a0At the same time, with the aging population, more older homeowners are\u00a0downsizing to rentals, the report says.\nThe availability of rental housing in Montreal is on par with what's happening across the country. The national vacancy rate stood at 2.2 per cent. That's down from 2.4 per cent in 2018, making it the lowest level since 2002.\nSome landlords and developers say Quebec's\u00a0strict regulations \u2014 rent control, costly building permits, zoning laws \u2014 are hurting the industry and making the situation worse.\n\"The more regulations we have, we have\u00a0less production of new housing stock,\" said Hans Brouillette, spokesperson for the Corporation des Propri\u00e9taires Immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0(CORPIQ), a landlords'\u00a0association.\nThe first step, he said, is to scale back on provincial and municipal regulations that raise costs for investors looking to build or renovate properties.\u00a0All the extra\u00a0costs get passed onto the renters, he said.\nProperty owners who can't raise rent enough to cover those costs\u00a0may turn to other options such as subdividing the property, letting their family move in, or hosting short-term rental services like Airbnb, he said.\nThey may even resort to leaving\u00a0the property vacant because it's not profitable to invest\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars in a unit that can only be rented at a nominal rate under the province's rental control laws, he said.\u00a0\n\"The rents are too low for the trouble of managing those apartments or renovating them,\" Brouillette said.\nHowever, those very regulations and policies that are\u00a0keeping more rental stock off the markets, according to Brouillette's group,\u00a0are what\u00a0tenants' advocacy groups say Quebec needs to tighten up.\nA provincial coalition of housing advocacy groups, RCLALQ, is demanding Quebec's housing minister come up with short-term emergency measures.\n\"Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest must act quickly if we want to prevent renters from finding\u00a0themselves on the streets on July 1,\" said RCLALQ spokesperson Maxim Roy-Allard in a statement.\nRents are becoming unaffordable\u00a0for many tenants, says RCLALQ, with\u00a095,000 Quebecers\u00a0paying more than 50 per cent of their income toward shelter, forcing them to cut back on other necessities.\nAnd the competition for rental units creates other problems as well, the group says.\n\"These low vacancy rates intensify the discrimination experienced by tenants as owners become more selective,\" tsaid RCLALQ.\n\"Even if discrimination is prohibited under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, many landlords do not hesitate to discriminate or use different schemes to avoid renting to certain people.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Houses in New Brunswick selling at unusually fast rate", "description": "Increase in home sales backed by record-setting month in May", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-real-estate-housing-market-sales-growth-1.5201871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5165054.1559841646!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/open-house-housing-realtor-real-estate-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 05, 2019 4:41 PM AT", "2019-07-05T19:41:33.666Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "New Brunswick homes are selling at the fastest rate in 10 years, creating a demand for supply that has agents hitting the streets in search of new listings, according to the New Brunswick Real Estate Association.\nThe rise in sales is backed by the best month the association has ever recorded. In May, 1,124 units were sold, an all-time record and 24.6 per cent higher than May 2018.\nThe numbers for June are still being crunched, but association president Sheila Henry said sales should remain high for much of 2019.\u00a0\n\"What we're seeing essentially is a great situation for sellers in New Brunswick,\" Henry told Information Morning Fredericton on Friday.\n\"Basically what's going on if you've got a home in good condition in a good location, and you've priced it well, it's going to sell fast and, as such, demand is still there.\"\nShe said housing supply is low, make situations ripe for multiple offers.\nThe year-to-date figures, gathered by the Canadian Real Estate Association, are also strong. A total of 3,622 units were sold across New Brunswick in the first five months of the year \u2014 a 20.3 per cent increase from the same period in 2018.\nThe trend has been felt acutely in the capital city. Home sales in Fredericton have outpaced the first five months of 2018 by 58 per cent. In Moncton, the increase was 23.7 per cent and 11.6 per cent in Saint John.\nThe association's other district \u2014 Northern Region and Valley \u2014 was the only one to see a decline in year-over-year sales, which dipped 6.7 per cent.\u00a0\nHenry said there are several factors at play, including more people coming, or returning, to New Brunswick.\u00a0\nThe \"mixed bag\" of buyers include U.S. making the most of the exchange rate or escaping the current political climate, people coming home to retire, and Canadian workers heading east for \"very good jobs here.\"\nNew Brunswick also has the lowest average home price in the country.\u00a0\nThe year-to-date average sale price rose to $180,385, a 4.8 per cent jump from the first five months of 2018.\nAccording the national association, the average price for sales in May 2019 jumped to $192,848, from $177,272 in May 2018.\nThe closest average price in another Canadian jurisdiction in May 2019 was $233,456 in Newfoundland and Labrador. The average price in Prince Edward Island was $242,318 and $252,442 in Nova Scotia.\n\"People who are coming back, let's say, to retire and they've been out in Calgary for a while or whatever,\" said Henry. \"What you've sold your home for in Calgary buys you a lovely property here with money to spare.\"\nThe average price of a home in Alberta is roughly $200,000 higher than in New Brunswick. That gap jumps to more than $400,000 in Ontario and more than $500,000 in British Columbia.\nHenry said the housing sector was also under the impression interest rates would jump this year.\n\"But that really hasn't happened,\" she said. \"So that makes it even better for the home buyer because your dollar buys a little more.\"\u00a0\nHenry said if the listing is \"reasonably priced\" it will sell fast. Sellers who hear of the high demand may be tempted to raise the asking price, she said, but they could face a much longer time on the market.\n\"If you've got a realtor who can come into your home and give you an analysis based on what's been selling, because that's always really the bottom line when it comes to it,\" Henry said, \"what we've been seeing is if those homes are properly priced, they've been selling quicker and they've been getting approximately 97 per cent of their asking price.\"\nThe high demand is supported by a decrease in housing stock. The Canadian Real Estate Association reported a total of 5,648 active MLS listings at the end of May \u2014 a 17.5 per cent drop from this point last year and an 11-year low.\nA decrease in listings balances the market, Henry said, but it has also forced agents to rethink how they operate.\n\"You get somewhat more back to basics, if I can call it that,\" Henry said.\u00a0\n\"You go door knocking. You know, you really do, you know, a higher level perhaps of solicitation, you maybe call your past clients, people who were interested who might have been expired and say, 'Look, here's what the market's like now.'\u00a0\n\"So there's a lot more backdoor activity, if you will, from the real estate perspective to get people to realize what the market's like.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Government lays out fine print of new CMHC program that could contribute 10% to price of first home", "description": "Program will be limited to first-time buyers who earn under $120K a year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cmhc-first-time-buyer-program-1.5178055", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178080.1560775983!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/housing-realtor-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 17, 2019 9:09 AM ET", "2019-06-17T16:23:51.786Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The government on Monday released details of\u00a0a program announced during the last federal budget,\u00a0an initiative that could see Canada's housing agency contribute up to 10 per cent of the price of a buyer's first home if certain conditions are met.\nUnder the\u00a0fine print for the First Time Home Buyer Incentive program, which was announced\u00a0in March and will officially launch in September, a first-time homebuyer who earns less than $120,000 can qualify. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation would kick in up to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the home, providing the borrower comes up with the minimum amount for an insured mortgage, which is now at five\u00a0per cent.\nThere's also a requirement that the total value of the mortgage plus the CMHC's portion don't\u00a0eclipse $480,000. A government official says that\u00a0effectively means the program is only available for properties worth a maximum of about $565,000, regardless of whether or not they have met the\u00a0other requirements.\nIf that bar is met, the CMHC may kick in an additional five\u00a0per cent of the purchase price of a resale home. For a newly built home, the CMHC\u00a0may contribute\u00a0up to 10 per cent.\nThe\u00a0stakes from the CMHC\u00a0would be\u00a0interest free, meaning no ongoing cost to pay down, like a mortgage does.\nBut the government says in exchange for its stake, the CMHC\u00a0would get\u00a0to participate \"in the upside and downside of the change in the property value\" \u2014 which means they would be\u00a0entitled to any corresponding increase in the value of a home when the buyer eventually sells. On the flip side, the government would\u00a0also be on the hook for any share of the loss if the property depreciates.\nOn a home costing $500,000, if the borrower puts up $25,000 and the CMHC puts up the same amount, the CMHC\u00a0would then\u00a0own\u00a0five\u00a0per cent of that home. So if, down the line, the house appreciates\u00a0to $600,000 and the borrower wants to sell, they would have to give the CMHC\u00a0five per cent of the sale price \u2014 $30,000 in this example \u2014 not the $25,000 the CMHC put down in the first place.\nWhile a bill would\u00a0be paid down the line, the savings over the years could\u00a0add up. In the example above, the program would save a would-be borrower $286 a month in mortgage costs over the life of the loan,\u00a0$3,430 a year.\n\"This will mean more money in the pockets of Canadians and will help up to an estimated 100,000 families across\u00a0Canada,\" said Jean-Yves Duclos, the Liberal MP and cabinet member in charge of the CMHC.\nFinancial adviser Rajiv Bissessur\u00a0says the program will likely help some people, but ultimately, it\u00a0amounts to just another form of debt for overleveraged borrowers.\n\"It's an interest-free loan, but it's still a loan they will have to pay back,\" he said.\nHe also said\u00a0the relatively low cap on prices and loan amounts\u00a0won't do much to help people who need it most, to\u00a0buy in some of the more expensive markets. \"We are not really fixing the problem.\"\nThe program must be paid back within 25 years \u2014 or if the buyer sells before that \u2014\u00a0but there's no financial penalty for buying the CMHC out of its stake, at whatever the fair value of the home is at the time.\nApplications will be accepted as of Sept. 2 for home sales that will close no earlier than Nov.\u00a01.\nIn addition to offering these programs itself, the government has earmarked $100 million a year to help fund other organizations that already offer similar programs.\nThat's a group that could include Toronto-based Options For Homes, which\u00a0has worked with 3,000 homeowners over the last quarter century on a similar model \u2014 putting up money to help them become home purchasers, in exchange for a stake in the property down the line.\n\"[This]\u00a0will go a long way to help to improve access to home ownership for middle-income earners and make progress in tackling affordability issues,\" CEO Heather Tremain said.\n\"We've been using the shared equity mortgage model for more than 25 years and have seen first-hand the positive impact it can have on working Canadians looking to achieve the dream of home ownership.\"\nBut some are critical of the government's program because they say it does little to help buyers in expensive cities that need the most help.\nMortgage Professionals Canada, which represents brokers across Canada, noted the $560,000 cap on the program makes it essentially useless in Toronto and Vancouver, where even entry-level homes cost far more.\nAgain, FTHBI helps aspiring homebuyers buy homes which cost less than approx $500,000. While this program may help in some parts of Canada, the average May 2019 home price reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TREBhome?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TREBhome</a> in the GTA, where the announcement was made, was $838,540.<a href=\"https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8\">https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qT23CPAh6n\">pic.twitter.com/qT23CPAh6n</a>\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, said the government program could actually reduce a would-be buyer's purchasing power in some cases. Eligibility is capped, where the amount being borrowed must be no more than four times the person's\u00a0annual income, but standard mortgage stress test rules allow for borrowers to get between 4.5 and 4.7 times their income.\n\"Those who would be attracted to the program would be Canadians who are trying to purchase at their maximum qualification,\" Laird said.\u00a0\"However, because the program diminishes how much you can qualify for, it doesn't serve the needs of the group it is targeted at.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation would kick in up to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the home, providing the borrower comes up with the minimum amount for an insured mortgage, which is now at five\u00a0per cent.\nThere's also a requirement that the total value of the mortgage plus the CMHC's portion don't\u00a0eclipse $480,000. A government official says that\u00a0effectively means the program is only available for properties worth a maximum of about $565,000, regardless of whether or not they have met the\u00a0other requirements.\nIf that bar is met, the CMHC may kick in an additional five\u00a0per cent of the purchase price of a resale home. For a newly built home, the CMHC\u00a0may contribute\u00a0up to 10 per cent.\nThe\u00a0stakes from the CMHC\u00a0would be\u00a0interest free, meaning no ongoing cost to pay down, like a mortgage does.\nBut the government says in exchange for its stake, the CMHC\u00a0would get\u00a0to participate \"in the upside and downside of the change in the property value\" \u2014 which means they would be\u00a0entitled to any corresponding increase in the value of a home when the buyer eventually sells. On the flip side, the government would\u00a0also be on the hook for any share of the loss if the property depreciates.\nOn a home costing $500,000, if the borrower puts up $25,000 and the CMHC puts up the same amount, the CMHC\u00a0would then\u00a0own\u00a0five\u00a0per cent of that home. So if, down the line, the house appreciates\u00a0to $600,000 and the borrower wants to sell, they would have to give the CMHC\u00a0five per cent of the sale price \u2014 $30,000 in this example \u2014 not the $25,000 the CMHC put down in the first place.\nWhile a bill would\u00a0be paid down the line, the savings over the years could\u00a0add up. In the example above, the program would save a would-be borrower $286 a month in mortgage costs over the life of the loan,\u00a0$3,430 a year.\n\"This will mean more money in the pockets of Canadians and will help up to an estimated 100,000 families across\u00a0Canada,\" said Jean-Yves Duclos, the Liberal MP and cabinet member in charge of the CMHC.\nFinancial adviser Rajiv Bissessur\u00a0says the program will likely help some people, but ultimately, it\u00a0amounts to just another form of debt for overleveraged borrowers.\n\"It's an interest-free loan, but it's still a loan they will have to pay back,\" he said.\nHe also said\u00a0the relatively low cap on prices and loan amounts\u00a0won't do much to help people who need it most, to\u00a0buy in some of the more expensive markets. \"We are not really fixing the problem.\"\nThe program must be paid back within 25 years \u2014 or if the buyer sells before that \u2014\u00a0but there's no financial penalty for buying the CMHC out of its stake, at whatever the fair value of the home is at the time.\nApplications will be accepted as of Sept. 2 for home sales that will close no earlier than Nov.\u00a01.\nIn addition to offering these programs itself, the government has earmarked $100 million a year to help fund other organizations that already offer similar programs.\nThat's a group that could include Toronto-based Options For Homes, which\u00a0has worked with 3,000 homeowners over the last quarter century on a similar model \u2014 putting up money to help them become home purchasers, in exchange for a stake in the property down the line.\n\"[This]\u00a0will go a long way to help to improve access to home ownership for middle-income earners and make progress in tackling affordability issues,\" CEO Heather Tremain said.\n\"We've been using the shared equity mortgage model for more than 25 years and have seen first-hand the positive impact it can have on working Canadians looking to achieve the dream of home ownership.\"\nBut some are critical of the government's program because they say it does little to help buyers in expensive cities that need the most help.\nMortgage Professionals Canada, which represents brokers across Canada, noted the $560,000 cap on the program makes it essentially useless in Toronto and Vancouver, where even entry-level homes cost far more.\nAgain, FTHBI helps aspiring homebuyers buy homes which cost less than approx $500,000. While this program may help in some parts of Canada, the average May 2019 home price reported by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TREBhome?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TREBhome</a> in the GTA, where the announcement was made, was $838,540.<a href=\"https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8\">https://t.co/yb7CfUSCv8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qT23CPAh6n\">pic.twitter.com/qT23CPAh6n</a>\nJames Laird, president of mortgage brokerage Canwise Financial, said the government program could actually reduce a would-be buyer's purchasing power in some cases. Eligibility is capped, where the amount being borrowed must be no more than four times the person's\u00a0annual income, but standard mortgage stress test rules allow for borrowers to get between 4.5 and 4.7 times their income.\n\"Those who would be attracted to the program would be Canadians who are trying to purchase at their maximum qualification,\" Laird said.\u00a0\"However, because the program diminishes how much you can qualify for, it doesn't serve the needs of the group it is targeted at. Canadians can get a larger loan by not participating in the program.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jason Proctor", "title": "B.C.

Supreme Court judge has rejected a Chinese woman's bid to certify a class action lawsuit against a foreign buyers tax designed to tackle the province's housing affordability crisis.\nJustice Gregory Bowden dismissed Jing\u00a0Li's claim after finding that the 20 per cent tax levied against foreign purchasers of residential property in B.C.'s hottest housing markets does not discriminate against either Asian or\u00a0Chinese buyers.\nIn a 43-page decision released Friday, Bowden found that the tax draws distinctions based on immigration status \u2014 not ethnic or national origin.\nAnd that people who don't have Canadian citizenship, including Chinese nationals, don't have to pay the tax if they are permanent residents or provincial nominees.\n\"The structure of the tax is not responsible for any unequal burden on Asian persons,\" Bowden wrote.\n\"It is not a numbers game. Buyers from Asian countries, such as China, receive equal treatment that is proportionate to the demand from those countries.\"\nThe judge's decision comes after a landmark summary trial held to determine the fate of legislation the previous Liberal government introduced in 2016 in order to cool an overheated\u00a0Lower Mainland housing market.\nThe tax initially required foreign entities (including foreign nationals) to pay an additional 15 per cent on the purchase of residential property in Greater Vancouver.\nThe current NDP government increased the tax to 20 per cent in February 2018 and expanded the reach of the tax to include the Fraser Valley, Capital Regional District, Nanaimo Regional District and the Central Okanagan.\nLi moved to Canada from China in 2013 to complete a master's degree in public administration.\nShe entered into a contract to buy a half-million dollar condo in Burnaby\u00a0in July 2016, the\u00a0month before the tax came into effect.\nHer\u00a0closing date was in November, which meant she would have to pay an additional $83,850 as she was neither a permanent resident nor a Canadian citizen.\nThe case was decided through a summary trial in which\u00a0both Li and the government argued the case through written affidavit evidence and expert reports from an array of academics who have been among the most widely quoted voices on the housing crisis in the past decade.\n\"It is not disputed that there has been a housing affordability problem in the [Greater Vancouver Regional District] for a number of years,\" Bowden wrote.\n\"Home ownership in Vancouver became less affordable than all other cities in Canada. Vancouver had become one of the most unaffordable real estate markets in the world.\"\nThe judge explained\u00a0that the provincial government decided to follow in the footsteps of jurisdictions including Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel and Australia in implementing a foreign buyers tax.\n\"Local factors did not appear responsible for the inflation of housing prices and public\u00a0commentary pointed to foreign demand,\" Bowden\u00a0wrote.\nLi argued against the tax on a number of different grounds. She claimed that the province was trying to usurp federal powers over immigration and citizenship.\nAnd she also accused the province of violating Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against discriminating on the basis of race,\u00a0national or ethnic origin or colour.\nThe judge found that the tax was intended to \"dampen demand\" and discourage foreign nationals from purchasing real estate. He said it was designed to make the local housing market more affordable without denying non-Canadian citizens the opportunity to own, rent or lease housing.\nHe also rejected Li's claim that the tax perpetuates prejudice, stereotyping or disadvantages of Chinese people in B.C.\n\"It is also notable that there was overwhelming support for the tax among Asians living in Greater Vancouver,\" Bowden wrote, citing the research of urban studies professor Andrew Yan.\n\"Professor Yan states that Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Chinese descent are equally impacted by housing affordability and equally will benefit from any measures that improve affordability.\"\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "In Nunakput, residents grapple with the N.W.T.'s most complex challenges", "description": "'How do we survive?

Honestly, I don't have an answer,\" he said.\u00a0\nIllasiak isn't alone in this situation. Families in all four of the Arctic communities that make up the Nunakput riding find themselves in similar situations\u00a0as they deal with the high cost of living, inadequate housing, and distance from the government services that are supposed to help them.\u00a0\nSix candidates are running to represent Nunakput\u00a0in the Oct. 1 territorial election: Annie Steen, Jackie Jacobson,\u00a0Alisa Blake\u00a0and Holly Campbell\u00a0from Tuktoyaktuk; Sheila Nasogaluak from Sachs Harbour; and Herb Nakimayak, the incumbent from Paulatuk.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhoever is elected will be tasked with addressing the complex issues families like Illasiak's face in the territory's biggest and most northern riding.\u00a0\nNunakput is made up of Tuktoyaktuk, Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour, and Paulatuk\u00a0\u2014 some of the territory's most expensive communities.\nIn Paulatuk, flour sells for $23.79 for a five-kilogram bag, a two-kilogram bag of sugar costs $10.29, and a kilogram tin of coffee sells for $30.99. In Yellowknife, the same bag of flour was $8.99, the sugar was on sale for $2.50 and the coffee was $18.99.\nGetting out on the land isn't cheap either\u00a0with trips often costing $2,000 or more, explained George Krengnektak, a hunter with one eye and tobacco stained hands.\u00a0\n\"I don't want my family, my grandchildren to go hungry,\" Krengnektak, 72, said. \"I bring food for them all the time. I don't like to see them hungry for meat and fish.\"\u00a0\nSlow economic activity in the region compounds this problem.\u00a0\nUnemployment across Nunakput is 24 per cent, three times the N.W.T. rate. Nearly half of\u00a0workers work part-time or only part of the year, while only one in four are employed full time year-round.\nOil and gas exploration and extraction remains stagnant in the region, and many work a few different jobs to make ends meet.\n\"The oil companies all pulled up their stakes and went south, you've got no one in the region right now,\" said Eddie Dillon, the chair of the Tuktoyaktuk Community Corporation.\u00a0\nThree of the four communities are fly-in only for the entire year, and Tuktoykatuk is still getting used to having year-round highway access.\u00a0\nIt's been nearly two years since the $300-million Inuvik Tuktoyaktuk\u00a0Highway opened, but people in Tuktoyaktuk say they still aren't seeing the transformative changes that were promised.\u00a0\nTourism has increased, though it isn't driving the economy in a meaningful way, and the community isn't getting the support it needs to care for tourists who come, Dillon said.\u00a0\n\"It's nice to talk about tourism, but we haven't gotten the dollars to upgrade the facilities to meet the tourism needs,\" he said.\u00a0\nBut some are worried that even if the road hasn't changed things yet, it may in time become a wedge between Tuktoyaktuk and the coastal communities, simply because Tuktoyaktuk is no longer isolated.\nThe road gives Tuktoyaktuk the ability to control costs in a way that the other communities, who rely solely on barges and airplanes for re-supply, can't.\n\"The reality of living in Tuk is different than the reality of living in Sachs Harbour,\" said Vernon Amos, the chair of the Sachs Harbour Community Corporation.\u00a0\n\"There's a core set of problems that are common in all communities, but each community has its own unique set of problems.\"\nFor example, while all the communities are dealing with the effects of climate change, in\u00a0Tuktoyaktuk, homes are about to fall into the ocean, with community officials crying out for relief from the federal and territorial governments.\u00a0\nPeople have started talking about splitting the riding, with one MLA representing Tuktoyaktuk and another representing the coastal communities.\u00a0\n\"Family-wise we're still connected, whether there's a road or not. But it's a valid point,\" said Merven Gruben, the mayor of Tuktoyaktuk.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven if the road does change the relationship between the three communities, housing will remain a common problem. Leaders in all four communities say it constantly tops their list of issues to solve.\u00a0\n\"Everything comes down to housing, it's a bigger issue,\" said Eddie Dillon of Tuktoyaktuk.\u00a0\u00a0\nThroughout Nunakput, there aren't enough places for people to live, and many of the homes that are available are unfit for the number of people living in them.\nJosie Green is working a steady job as an environmental resources monitor in Paulatuk, but she's homeless. She\u00a0blames a\u00a0housing official for giving her wrong information, which forced her to leave her home.\n\"You can't get any answers from the [housing] board here,\" Green said.\u00a0\"It felt like nobody was listening.\"\u00a0\nGreen is one of many on the housing waitlist across the riding \u2014 which is also a larger issue throughout the Northwest Territories. Some have been waiting years for a home, or are forced to deal with inadequate, mouldy units.\u00a0\nLocal authorities call the NWT's housing policies 'paternalistic' here's why\u00a0\nMayor Laverna Klengenberg sees the same thing happening in Ulukhaktok, and blames bureaucrats in Yellowknife for shutting local leaders out of the decision process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They don't seem to know what it's really like in the smaller northern communities,\" she said.\u00a0\nOthers have echoed these concerns, saying they feel local officials are unable to get things done. Instead, they're left to navigate complex bureaucratic systems, often alone.\u00a0\nBack at his kitchen table, Illasiak has some advice for whoever wins the seat on Oct. 1: pick up the phone, return emails, and listen to the people living in the riding.\n\"Don't say you're going to be there for the people,\" he said.\u00a0\"Don't say you're going to pick up the phone unless you're actually going to do it.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Jack Julian", "title": "'$150 can go a long way': Mother of 5 says her rent is being unfairly raised", "description": "Melissa Douthwright says 2 of her neighbours didn't receive the same increase", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mother-worries-rent-unfairly-raised-1.5499658", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499714.1584397342!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/melissa-douthwright.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 17, 2020 1:54 PM AT", "2020-03-17T16:54:07.697Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A mother in Lower Sackville, N.S., is feeling squeezed out of her rental home because she says her landlord plans to raise\u00a0her rent in part because she and her husband have five children.\nMelissa Douthwright\u00a0said she\u00a0and her family, who\u00a0have\u00a0been living in the home on Romaz Court since July\u00a02018, learned recently their monthly rent would rise by $150 to $1,450 on July 1.\n\"I was sick to my stomach, thinking, 'Why such an increase?' ... $150 can go a long way when it comes to food or clothing. We have one income,\" she said.\nDouthwright shares the home with her husband, Mike, and five children:\u00a0Alivia, 10, Kyliee, 8, Kaden, 5, Brooklyn, 3,\u00a0and Liam, 7 months. The three-bedroom home is part of a cul-de-sac development of 12 identical homes owned by Klavdia Gonopolskiy of Halifax.\nDouthwright said\u00a0she moved into the home because the street offered a safe place for her children to play with neighbours. The current $1,300 monthly rent, which includes cold water but no other utilities, fits her family's budget, she said.\nThen on Feb. 29, Douthwright said\u00a0she received a notice from her landlord about the rental increase, which she said\u00a0she can't afford.\nDoughwright said two neighbours she's friends with received rental increases of $25 a month, and another\u00a0received no increase at all. After the increases, those neighbours will be paying between $1,325 and $1,375.\nDouthwright sent an email to her landlord\u00a0asking why her increase was\u00a0so much more than her neighbours.\nIn an email reply, Gonopolskiy said Douthwright was not honest about how many of her children would be living in the home when she signed her lease. Gongolposkiy said she'd charge $1,450 per month to a large family who wants to move in.\n\"If I will need to rent a unit to a family of 6: 2 adults and 4 kids with a big dog, I will ask for the same price,\" Gonopolskiy wrote.\nShe wrote that she would not discuss how much she charges her other tenants as the amounts are \"confidential.\"\nDouthwright said\u00a0she doesn't understand why she and her family are being treated differently and doesn't believe it's fair.\nMegan Deveaux, a community legal worker with Dalhousie Legal Aid in Halifax who specializes in residential tenancy disputes, said landlords in Nova Scotia can increase rents by any amount once per year, as long as they give tenants adequate notice.\nBut there are several grounds for a tenant to appeal, including that they are being singled out in some way and receiving a rent increase much larger than others who live in similar-sized units in the same building.\nDeveaux,\u00a0who wouldn't comment\u00a0on Douthwright's situation, said\u00a0tenants can appeal a rent increase that's too high compared to market rates for a similar unit. But she said\u00a0leeway is given to landlords who have made improvements to their properties or who are incurring extra costs.\n\"The landlord's burden at that point is to demonstrate that this is a reasonable increase, even though it's different than everybody else's,\" Deveaux said.\nShe said landlords have no legal authority to bar family members living together in a home, unless there's a safety issue such as a restraining order against another tenant in the building.\nLandlords can charge more rent for more residents in a unit, but only if they can demonstrate an increased cost burden as a result.\nGonopolskiy denied in an interview that\u00a0she is discriminating against the Douthwrights and said she too has children. She\u00a0said\u00a0she purchased the buildings on Romaz Court in 2016, about a year after she immigrated to Canada from Israel.\nHer experience as a landlord has been good, she said, but\u00a0dealing with Douthwright has been hard work.\nShe said\u00a0Douthwright's rental cheques\u00a0are routinely returned with insufficient funds, and that she pays her rent late nearly every month. Gonopolskiy\u00a0said it often takes dozens of messages to collect a month's rent.\nIn May 2019, the residential tenancies board issued an eviction notice to the Douthwright family for chronic late payment of rent. Gonopolskiy said\u00a0she allowed the family to stay in an attempt to be compassionate.\n\"Because they have kids, I said, 'OK, now you know you can stay. If you will pay your rent, I will still give you time,' because they were already overdue,\" she said.\nGonopolskiy said\u00a0the new rental amount\u00a0is fair market value for the unit, and the discrepancy in rents between units has to do with when her various tenants moved into Romaz Court.\n\"If I rent her unit to another family, I would ask for this amount. It's a price on the market. They are almost there two years, and it's the first time I give them an increase,\" Gonopolskiy said.\nBoth Douthwright and Gonopolskiy have appealed to Nova Scotia's residential tenancies board for relief.

But, officials with the centre say finding enough rentals\u00a0to fill that list has become harder in recent years.\nAdam\u00a0Brazier, artistic director of performing arts at the Confederation Centre, said many of the properties that had been available in the past have transitioned to short-term rentals.\n\"Places that we rented that had a good five months for the artists to live in are now off the market for us.\nBrazier said the centre typically brings 40 to 50 actors,\u00a0directors, designers and musicians\u00a0to P.E.I. to work on various productions in the Charlottetown Festival\u00a0throughout the summer. He said increasing rental prices have also made it difficult to find affordable places that also fit the actors needs.\n\"We're putting out the call because it has become a bigger challenge over the past three years and this is something that we need community support in to make happen,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We need these artists to be able to come and afford a cost of living here on the Island.\"\nBut Brazier said for some actors, making the trip to the Island is no longer financially\u00a0viable. He said some actors and other workers on the productions are simply not willing to be a part of the festival because of the cost of housing.\u00a0\n\"The challenge is for a lot of artists, that 'Well if I can't rent out my place in Toronto or Calgary or wherever I am, I can't actually afford to come and do the festival,'\" Brazier said.\nHe also said since many of the actors come to the Island from other provinces or countries, they usually don't have cars and need to find housing within walking distance of the centre.\u00a0He said some have had to resort to sharing accommodations or finding space in people's living rooms in order to stay in Charlottetown.\n\"We've had some artists who have had to go couch-surfing for a while, and it's really unfortunate and we really try very hard not to let that happen,\" he said.\n\"We can't unfortunately create housing, we can only work with what we have.\"\nBrazier said anyone willing to offer a rental property can reach out to the Confederation Centre to have it added to the list.\u00a0\nHe said the centre is interested in all available rentals, even if they aren't available for the entire season.\u00a0\n\"Whether it is something that can be held for five months or even if it's something that you have for five weeks as well, it's worth reaching out.\"\nBrazier said the centre is also working with Holland College to rent dorm rooms,\u00a0and the centre is open to exploring other housing options moving forward.\n"}, {"author": "Winston Szeto", "title": "Metro Vancouver housing sales remain sluggish in May", "description": "Latest report shows property sales 23 per cent below 10-year average", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-housing-sales-sluggish-may-1.5161979", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5068893.1559692193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 5:16 PM PT", "2019-06-05T00:30:15.197Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Housing sales in Greater Vancouver were\u00a022.9 per cent lower last month than the 10-year average and the lowest for May\u00a0since 2000, according to\u00a0a report by Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV) published Tuesday.\nThe real estate board says\u00a0a total of 2,638 homes were sold in May 2019, a 6.9 per cent drop from the 2,833 homes sold in May 2018.\nHowever, sales were up 44.2 per cent from the 1,829 homes sold in April.\nOur latest stats report is out!

The waiting list for people in this city is very, very long\u00a0to get into affordable housing. Very long. And it's a struggle,\" Robinson said.\u00a0\nGillian Benoit Gonzalez,\u00a0the resident engagement coordinator for Ford City Neighbourhood Renewal strategy, said she regularly speaks with individuals in the neighbourhood struggling to find housing that's affordable,\u00a0safe and accessible.\n\"Before, this was the cheap area. It's no longer the cheap area,\" Gonzalez said.\nShe said new businesses in the area have helped revitalize the neighbourhood, but housing costs have risen as a result.\u00a0\n\"People are having a hard time finding something that they can afford rental-wise, [and] purchasing a home has become really expensive,\"\u00a0said Kayla Lessard, the community development coordinator with Ford City Neighbourhood Renewal.\nLessard added that as a result, it's pushing some people out and\u00a0away from the place\u00a0they used to call home.\nNot long ago, one could find a one-bedroom apartment in the realm of $550 or $650, Gonzalez\u00a0explained.\u00a0Now, however, apartments cost\u00a0closer to $1,000.\u00a0\n\"That was unheard of two years ago even. And so, across the city, but specifically in Ford City, seeing that happen is kind of shocking,\" she said.\nGonzalez\u00a0explained that\u00a0many residents in the neighbourhood have been forced to resort to living situations that aren't necessarily safe or legal.\nShe gave an example of a man in the area who lives in a basement apartment that regularly floods and has black mould.\nGonzalez said he can't afford anything else, adding that for others in similar situations, there's a fear that if they file a complaint about their unsafe living conditions, they'll end up on the streets because they'll have no where else to go.\nWith the federal election around the corner, Gonzalez said she'd like to see candidates push for more subsidies for low-income individuals; more incentives for landlords to keep their homes affordable; and more investment towards geared-to-income housing.\nThe Liberal party\u00a0aims to build 100,000 affordable housing units over the next\u00a0decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes \u2014 with restrictions.\u00a0\nIn a statement, Windsor-Tecumseh\u00a0Liberal candidate Irek Kusmierczyk said, from his experience as a Windsor city councillor, he's seen that there is \"absolutely a shortage of affordable housing,\" as well as as a long wait list for affordable housing.\u00a0\n\"As the member for Windsor-Tecumseh, I want to advocate for our community to make sure we benefit from our Liberal government's new, 10-year investment of nearly $20 billion in social infrastructure,\" said Kusmierczyk, adding that the Liberal party will prioritize significant new investment in affordable housing as well as seniors' facilities.\u00a0\nThe NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to building 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.\n\"This is a real challenge for people,\" said Cheryl Hardcastle, the NDP candidate in Windsor-Tecumseh.\u00a0\n\"First of all, the opportunities that young people have to be first-time homebuyers is nearly impossible now. The second thing is the variety of housing options that we have is extremely limited now,\" Hardcastle said. \"So, regarding your income or stage of life for instance, you want to downsize as a senior, the market just is not accommodating people that way and in a way that they can afford. So it really is a big concern.\"\nShe added that, in addition to building more units, the NDP will work to make things easier for first-time homebuyers; will implement a foreign buyers tax on residential properties bought by people who do not live in Canada; and will find ways to develop a greater variety of housing options for would-be\u00a0residents.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the Conservative party\u00a0plans on reviewing the so-called \"stress test\" to help first-time homebuyers get approved for mortgages and allow people to take out longer mortgages for lower monthly payments.\u00a0\nLeo Demarce, the Conservative candidate for Windsor-Tecumseh, said the Conservative\u00a0party will also look at federal Crown land and bring it to the market to provide development for affordable housing. Furthermore, he added that the party is looking to eliminate the federal carbon tax, which he said has a huge cost on affordability.\u00a0\n\"Personally I am going to go into the communities and talk about affordable housing with our city councillors and our mayors and talk about really reaching out to the developers in terms of creating developments for affordable housing, as opposed to larger houses with more condensed access, more condensed housing,\" Demarce said, adding that he'd like to prioritize housing for seniors as well.\u00a0\nWindsor-Tecumseh Green party Giovanni Abati said there is certainly a housing crunch.\u00a0\n\"The Green party is pushing for giving incentives, either tax incentives if people want to donate land or property, tax incentives like removing the GST from builders if they want to build affordable housing or senior's homes or childcare spaces, there's a need for all that.\"\nDaniel Burr, Windsor-Tecumseh People's Party candidate,\u00a0said it's necessary to look at the causes of affordable housing issues in the riding, pointing to high levels of immigration in Canada as a concern.\n\"Immigrants are settling in large cities like Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and driving up the housing prices in those cities,\" he said.\n\"We're seeing a trickle down effect in Windsor as far as the housing prices in Windsor from people moving from Toronto are \u2014 you know, driving up to housing prices in Windsor.\u00a0So if we can lower the immigration levels to more realistic levels for Canada, I think that will help with affordable housing.\"\nHe said there is no housing plan included in his party's platform, but there is a plan to make life in general more affordable.\nLaura Chesnik, Windsor-Tecumseh Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada (MLPC) candidate,\u00a0said the government needs to invest in high-quality public housing, adding that there needs to be more units in place to address rent control, private monopolies of buildings\u00a0and to protect individuals against discrimination when they seek housing.\u00a0\n\"One of the MLPC policies is that housing is a right and so it should be enshrined in the constitution as a basic human right,\" she said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-march-11-2020-1.5492157", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2020 6:56 AM ET", "2020-03-11T10:56:52.767Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

(APBC) says after 25 years that wage increases\u00a0to $77,000.\nCrighton, Koonts and Stephens all worked part time in their home communities before applying for coveted full-time jobs which, for the most part, are available only in Metro Vancouver because of higher call volume.\u00a0\nB.C. Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) hires approximately 300 paramedic recruits annually who work part time as they gain seniority\u00a0and are able to compete for full-time jobs.\u00a0\nAccording to BCEHS, based on the way the seniority system works, it typically takes\u00a0four to five years to gain a full-time job and well into a career\u00a0before a spot opens up in a smaller city.\u00a0\n\"I know paramedics in the Okanagan that commuted for 10 years\u00a0before they were able to get back to where they lived,\" said Stephens, who now works in Kamloops, B.C.\u00a0\nHer husband recently got a full-time job in Kelowna.\u00a0\nCrighton and Koonts expect to be waiting years for a job on Vancouver Island.\u00a0\nBCEHS, however,\u00a0says the latest collective agreement with paramedics will create more full-time jobs and there should be shorter waits for paramedics to work close to home.\u00a0\u00a0\nParamedics work four days on and four days off.\u00a0\nMost of those who commute make the trip down the day before their rotation starts and head home as quickly as possible after it ends.\u00a0\nStephens says at one point she and her husband were both commuting the often treacherous Coquihalla Highway at the same time and hired a nanny to look after their children.\u00a0\n\"We would drive the night before our first day shift. And, then after our last nightshift we would drive home,\" said Stephens.\u00a0\nIt meant they were away from their children five nights out of eight.\u00a0\nFor Koonts, going\u00a0back and forth from Vancouver Island each day would incur\u00a0the expense of a ferry trip\u00a0and that's too much.\u00a0\nKoonts now travels to Vancouver for her four-day rotation, stays in town during her days off and works some overtime shifts,\u00a0and then works her next\u00a0four-day rotation.\nShe doesn't see her family for 12 days at a time.\n\"If I could afford to live over there, I absolutely would,\" she said of Vancouver.\u00a0\nInstead Koonts\u00a0pays $625 a month to rent a bedroom in a house\u00a0in Tsawwassen, south of Vancouver,\u00a0to use while she's at work.\nIt's not uncommon for groups of commuting paramedics to rent an apartment and share it between\u00a0platoons on different shifts.\u00a0\nThey refer to the accommodations as haciendas.\u00a0\n\"There's always somebody in the hacienda, somebody always staying there and it cuts the cost of rent down significantly,\" said Crighton.\u00a0\n\"Instead of just one person renting it, there's eight people renting it.\"\u00a0\nAPBC president Troy Clifford has watched the affordability crisis evolve over his 32 years as a paramedic.\u00a0\nThere used to be a time, he says, paramedics aspired to come to Vancouver.\u00a0\nNow, he says, if they're from outside the region, they're forced to come up with whatever remedies they can to make ends meet.\u00a0\u00a0\nCrighton\u00a0and the others\u00a0agree the additional cost of commuting is still\u00a0cheaper than moving to\u00a0live in Vancouver.\u00a0\n\"The cost of living here versus the cost of living in Parksville, it's not even comparable,\" said Crighton.\u00a0\nTreading Water is a series from CBC British Columbia examining the impact of the affordability crisis on people in Metro Vancouver and across the province, including the creative solutions being used to make ends meet.\nIf you have a story for our Treading Water series, please click\u00a0here\u00a0and tell us about it.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Jon Hernandez", "title": "'A mother should never ever have to be put in this position': Chilliwack mom on brink of homelessness", "description": "Michelle Paquette cares for 5 children; 2 have disabilities", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/this-is-all-for-her-chilliwack-mom-on-brink-of-homelessness-struggles-to-support-family-1.5393325", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393464.1576258494!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/michelle-paquette.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 13, 2019 3:00 AM PT", "2019-12-13T11:00:00.331Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Michelle Paquette\u00a0nearly lost her baby daughter\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0once \u2014 and she's trying her hardest not to lose her again.\nLast summer, Paquette found the infant lying\u00a0lifeless inside her crib in the middle of the night, just weeks after she was born. The incident was later diagnosed as\u00a0a case of sudden infant death syndrome.\n\"My attempts at giving her CPR didn't work,\" Paquette\u00a0told CBC News from her home in Chilliwack. \"I had to call on my son Lucas to help...\u00a0and he saved her life.\"\nThough Eleanor survived, the baby,\u00a0now just over six months old, suffered severe brain damage. She's partially blind and has been diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Paquette says she spends many of her days travelling to medical appointments across\u00a0the region.\nBut\u00a0she has four other kids to care for, and the family is in dire financial straits. Paquette couldn't afford to pay the December rent on her three-bedroom apartment as she grapples with health, food and living costs.\nPoverty advocates say Paquette's\u00a0situation has become all too common in the Fraser Valley and beyond, as the unaffordability crisis hits families across the province.\n\"As the cost of living increases, the cost of housing, the cost of child care \u2014 particularly for children with special needs \u2014 people are falling into poverty,\" said Helesia Luke, a spokesperson with the poverty advocacy group First Call B.C.\nA recent provincial report card found that\u00a0one in five children in B.C. are in poverty.\n\"This is not a problem exclusive to the metro region at all,\" said Luke, \"As people leave those urban centres to get more affordable housing, housing prices in those [other]\u00a0areas go up as well.\"\nPaquette hopes\u00a0her family will get accepted\u00a0into an affordable home provided by B.C.

A mother should never ever have to be put in this position \u2014 to really be faced\u00a0to look at paying expenses and bills, or paying your rent,\" she said. \"It's really hard.\"\nPaquette is a former support worker for vulnerable women, now\u00a0off work and collecting a monthly disability payment.\nThe family moved to Metro Vancouver from Cranbrook, B.C. in 2017, where they lived in subsidized housing. Leaving that behind was a tough decision for Paquette, but she felt it was necessary.\nHer six-year-old son Boden\u00a0has autism and she said there are more health services available for him in B.C.'s Lower Mainland.\n\"We left B.C. Housing for market rental \u2014 and we've just been trying to survive ever since,\" she said.\nSince then, she's had three more kids.\u00a0Eleanor\u00a0and her twin brother, Max, were born in June. The family of six has since settled in Chilliwack.\nTreating both Boden and Eleanor's disabilities on a limited income has been a\u00a0challenge. Paquette\u00a0has to make weekly trips to Vancouver for medical services, often for days at a time. The costs of food, fuel, accommodations, and medications have piled up.\n\"I'm just overblown with the amount of appointments we have make,\" she said. \"We see a pediatrician once a month, a neurologist once a month, physiotherapy, occupational therapy. We see a dietitian, we see an ophthalmologist... It's put us into a financial crisis.\"\nPaquette asked to be\u00a0issued an eviction notice prior to the day before her rent was due, knowing she couldn't afford it.\nThe document allows her to apply for a $700\u00a0crisis supplement\u00a0from the Ministry of Children and Family Development. She's hopeful she can put the dollars toward a delayed rent payment.\nPaquette has been working closely with housing advocates at the Salvation Army. Captain Matt Kean said the organization has been working\u00a0to find housing options for her.\nB.C. Housing would not comment on the circumstances due to confidentiality, but noted there are more than 20,000 people on its registry whose needs are assessed on a case-by-case basis. The agency offers subsidized units to families \u2014\u00a0but advocates say they can be difficult to access.\nViveca Ellis, a community organizer for the B.C. Poverty Reduction Coalition, said single mothers with more than three children struggle to find adequate housing in Metro Vancouver and across the province.\n\"They end up waiting on the affordable housing lists for a very long time, because there is not enough large family stock in British Columbia.\"\nIt's a future that feels fragile, and uncertain. But Paquette draws inspiration from her daughter.\n\"This is all for her. It is absolutely all for her,\" she said.\n\"Life is just too short, and when you have such a miracle such as her, you have to cherish every moment. I just look at her, and I'm just extremely blessed,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1604466243753", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Don't get scammed: Fraudulent online rental ads on the rise in Montreal", "description": "Prospective tenants need to know their rights and keep an eye out for scams", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/fraudulent-online-rental-ad-1.5229379", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5229605.1564436829!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-fleuridas.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 30, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-07-30T10:54:22.464Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Carole Fleuridas\u00a0was looking to rent her condo in Rosemont\u00a0and posted an ad online, but she was surprised when two prospective tenants showed up unannounced at her home, saying they had an appointment to view the place.\nFleuridas\u00a0said the two young women\u00a0had been in contact with a man who had convinced them to put up a financial deposit in exchange for viewing the apartment.\n\"I was quite shocked,\" said Fleuridas.\nShe realized quickly that the girls had seen a fraudulent ad on a housing website advertising her condo and using her photos but with a lower price.\n\"I realized that there was something wrong,\" she said. \"The guy had a whole story.\"\nThe man behind the fake ad\u00a0told the potential tenants that\u00a0he lived outside of the city and required a deposit in order to meet them for an apartment visit.\nThe women tried to contact him after it became clear that he was not the owner of the condo, but it was too late.\nFleuridas\u00a0doesn't remember exactly how much the two women said they paid him, but said it was more than $100.\n\"I told them to see the police with all the information they had because obviously it was a fake,\" she said.\nThese kinds of apartment rental scams have been around for years, but are becoming increasingly\u00a0common in Montreal, according to industry insiders.\nThey say\u00a0these kinds of scams often use images and text posted by real landlords but with a cheaper\u00a0price and a\u00a0scammer's contact information.\nPhilippe Marchesseault, who works for the apartment listing site Appartmap, told Radio-Canada that pirated ads have tripled in recent years.\nHe said the company is trying to get ahead of it by taking more steps to verify landlords and remove fraudulent ads.\n\"We are in the process of reviewing everything,\" he said, adding that they are looking at verifying landlords' identities using tax records.\nThe same type of scam\u00a0can be found on the site\u00a0Kangalou, where administrators say the number of fake ads has doubled in the last year alone.\n\"Especially given the current housing shortage, it's more difficult to find nice rentals at a decent price,\" said\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois Albert, technology director at\u00a0Kangalou's parent company, the\u00a0Corporation des propri\u00e9taires immobiliers du Qu\u00e9bec.\u00a0\n\"It can be tempting to say, 'I found it.

Since 2009, 12 people who were sick with active tuberculosis in Nunavut have died.\u00a0\n\"This is one of our most serious domestic issues. It requires attention and it requires a budget,\" Philpott said.\u00a0\nThe government of Nunavut spends around $10 million a year on treatment alone, but actively fighting the disease costs much more.\nBeginning in February 2018 three of the territory's 25 hamlets received community-wide screenings, in which almost every community member was tested. The price tag for those three interventions was nearly $6 million.\nThe federal government covered the cost of the community screening clinics, but the funding has since dried up. Nunavut's chief public health officer, Dr. Michael\u00a0Patterson, says he wants to run more clinics.\n\"If we are going to do community-wide screenings we need to have funding levels that are sustainable and predictable and we can run it as a program,\" Patterson said.\nAnd if the clinics don't continue, Patterson is unequivocal \u2014 tuberculosis\u00a0will remain a problem. Officials at the Department of Indigenous Services say they are fully committed to supporting Nunavut's efforts, but the necessary funding has yet to materialize.\nPatterson said Nunavut's Department of Health is working with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated \u2014 the organization that represents Inuit in Nunavut \u2014 to develop a regional plan, which will be unveiled in March. He says he is hopeful that the federal government will make the necessary financial commitments by then.\nBut there is a larger problem \u2014 clinics alone won't lead to the elimination of TB.\n\"TB numbers will drop but if we don't fix other problems \u2014 housing, food, employment \u2014 the numbers will come back,\" Patterson said.\u00a0\nThe housing crisis among Inuit is a major factor in the spread of TB and addressing the current housing needs in Nunavut will cost more than a billion dollars.\nPhilpott said it's time for Canadians to wake up to the fact that their fellow Canadians are dying as a result of underfunding.\n\"It comes time to put our money where our mouth is ... Canadians have not done what's right,\" Philpott said.\u00a0\nShe said the answer is to create unavoidable political pressure, which will only happen when all Canadians make northern living conditions a priority.\n"}, {"author": "Sarah MacMillan", "title": "'Tent town' draws attention to Island's affordable housing crisis", "description": "'There are people that are very close to this situation \u2026 there are people living in cars.'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tents-affordable-housing-protest-1.5168014", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5168084.1560025282!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tent-town-event.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jun 08, 2019 6:28 PM AT", "2019-06-09T13:06:43.710Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Volodymyr Zahorodniy is in a situation familiar to many renters in Charlottetown.\nHe needs to be out of his apartment by the end of the month\u00a0and is looking for an affordable apartment for him and his family.

When asked what impact it's making in her life, she said, \"a good impact, a really good one.\"\n\"I've been eating healthier and I've lost weight from not eating junk [and switching] to eating tomatoes, grapes \u2014 all those good foods.\"\nAccess to healthy food in the area is a problem, say patrons, as is the price point for such foods.\n\"It's helped us [because] we haven't really been able to afford a lot of groceries,\" said\u00a0Christine Murchison, who stopped by the Bear Clan \"den\" for food.\n\"It gave us fruit and vegetables which we rarely could afford to buy.\"\nThe average household income in Point Douglas is just over $39,600, according to the U of M study. That's significantly lower than the Winnipeg average of just over $58,500.\nIn addition, nearly half of all renters in the neighbourhood\u00a0spend about 30 per cent of their income on housing, compared to 37 per cent of renters in the rest of the city spending that percentage of their income on housing.\nThe unemployment rate for Point Douglas is 9.5 per cent, compared to 5.9 per cent for the rest of Winnipeg, according to the study.\nThe researchers found the Bear Clan program serves an average of 117 people per day, although some days that number is much higher. One day in September this year, the program served 422 people, including 122 children.\nBrian Chrupalo, the board chair for the Bear Clan, said the number of people accessing the program is increasing every month.\u00a0\n\"To see it develop to where it is now, how it's expanded even from January to now, the amount of people that are coming here\u00a0\u2026\u00a0we see people lining up around the corner,\" Chrupalo said.\n\"So clearly there's a need for it and a huge demand for the service we're providing here.\"\nBear Clan Patrol has a partnership with six grocers in Winnipeg, who donate food that would otherwise be\u00a0bound for the garbage bin.\nVolunteers\u00a0pick\u00a0up food that's\u00a0near or past its best-before date\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is generally still perfectly safe to eat\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or otherwise deemed not suitable to sell.\u00a0\nSee how the Bear Clan food project helps those in need:\nFrom there, patrons are guided by staff and volunteers to select food. Selections are\u00a0based on factors like whether the patron knows how to cook with the food, what\u00a0they already have at home, their personal tastes\u00a0and any health conditions, such as\u00a0diabetes.\nAlthough the food is donated by grocery stores, Bear Clan covers costs for the vehicles to pick up and deliver the food and for employees.\nThe U of M report says\u00a0Bear Clan's program is different from other charities of its kind because it provides choice, freshness and frequent access\u00a0to healthy food.\nIt's also based right in the community.\n\"People are walking from close proximity to come and get this stuff,\" Chrupalo said.\u00a0\n\"They can't sometimes go to the bigger organizations like Winnipeg Harvest and Siloam. They're all doing great work, but at the same time, we're right here in the community, community-based, and we're helping the people that are in this area.\"\nThe study also said patrons, many of whom have chronic illnesses, reported\u00a0that their health improved as a result of the increased food access\u00a0\u2014 something Chrupalo said he's also heard from people using the program.\n\"It's a huge benefit for the community for this food distribution program to be going on.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "From big bargains to bank breakers, Edmonton real estate stays stagnant", "description": "About 60 properties listed at less than $100K and 60 listed for more than $2 million", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/real-estate-edmonton-alberta-1.5406951", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5401030.1577125502!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/for-sale-graphic-edmonton-image.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 03, 2020 6:00 AM MT", "2020-01-03T13:00:00.755Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Search high or low in Edmonton's real estate market and you'll find similarly sized clusters of properties waiting to be sold.\nOn the low side, about 60 Edmonton properties were listed at less than $100,000 late last year.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, roughly the same number of properties were listed for more than $2 million.\nIn this sluggish market, the struggles can be similar for sellers, whether the home has a spiral staircase and room for a baby grand piano or is a one-bedroom condominium in an aging building.\n\"(They're) different leagues but it's interesting that some of the same pressures apply but in\u00a0different ways,\" said Michael Brodrick, chair of the Realtors Association of Edmonton. \"The whole market has been subject to these pressures on price.\"\nBut every real estate market is defined by opposing forces, which means if things are rough for sellers the possibilities are great for buyers.\n\"At the high end, you're getting very good value for your money. You're getting everything you could possibly want for a reasonable price,\" Brodrick said, adding that those looking to enter the market will find reasonable prices, too.\nThe lowest end of Edmonton's real estate market, excluding mobile homes, is dominated by one-bedroom condominium units. At least two were listed for less than $50,000 in late 2019.\n\"If you think about the things that affect housing value, this all makes sense,\" said David Dale-Johnson, the Stan Melton executive professor in real estate at the University of Alberta. \"They're old, small and generally speaking they're not close to the downtown core or hubs of business and retail.\n\"These are all factors that affect the value of any home, and these are no exception.\"\nSuch prices might evoke memories of the 1990s for long-time real estate watchers. And many units in that price range were built long before that, often in the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0\nThat brings risks for buyers, Dale-Johnson noted.\n\"If I were looking to buy one of these, one of the very first things I would be asking is, 'How well has the property been maintained? What's been replaced? What's going to need to be replaced in the near future?'\"\nA new heating system, roof or windows are all significant costs that might be passed on to individual unit owners if a building's reserve fund isn't big enough. A condominium association can impose a special assessment on owners to cover such expenses for the whole building.\nOverall, the average condominium sale price in Edmonton in October 2019 was $227,802 \u2014\u00a0an almost three per cent increase over the previous year. But that average price was down about\u00a0eight per cent from 2015.\nThe drop in Edmonton condominium prices has been blamed on a number of factors: overdevelopment in the past and a flood of new units now entering the market; a flurry of conversions that turned rental units into condos; and investors who bought during the boom and now want to get rid of their properties.\n\"It's not a great market, to be honest,\" said Dale-Johnson.\u00a0\n\"The city continues to grow but it won't grow as quickly until either the pipeline gets on stream or we develop other business activities to fill the void. Having said that, it's a great city, with good schools and affordable housing. People do like it.\"\u00a0\nCalgary had just two properties listed for less than $100,00 at the end of 2019.\nClimb the price scale and you'll find mansions on well-manicured lots, with majestic river valley views and plenty of granite and marble.\nMulti-million dollar properties are relatively rare in the city.\n\"When you look at the Edmonton market versus a market like Vancouver, we still have space in which to build,\" said Brodrick from the realtors association.\n\"When you start getting into two-, three-, four-million dollars in Edmonton, there are still places where you can buy whatever lot you want and you can build whatever house suits your style.\"\nThe highest priced Edmonton property listed for sale late last year was an $8.5-million mansion that belonged to businessman Bruce Saville. The house has almost 20,000-square-feet of living space, an indoor pool and a wine room.\nBut it sat on the market throughout 2019.\n\"The right question for these properties is, 'Is the right buyer out there?'\" said Dale-Johnson.\n\"Money isn't an issue for these households or individuals. It's more a question of whether the property suits their wants and needs. That said, if they're buying today, they know what's going on in the economy and they will negotiate aggressively.\"\nAnd even the wealthiest sellers sometimes have to consider their options in a tough market, said realtor Wayne\u00a0Moen, who has sold real estate in the city for about 45 years.\nHe noted one client trying to sell a luxury property outside of the city who had dropped his price from $1.5 million to $1 million but still couldn't find a buyer.\n\"I had to be frank with the client and said, 'If you had a good renter, I think you'd be better off renting,'\" he said.\u00a0\n\"You just try to counsel people. Our job, if we're going to call ourselves professionals, we have to actually tell people the way we see things and what the outlook is. You don't want to blue sky people, you have to tell them, you have to be aggressive with price selling and make sure your property presents itself well.

It is row housing, with a difference,\" said Casey. \"It's called joint control, or condominium housing.\"\nIn a condominium, the purchaser bought a unit, rather than renting it from a landlord. And all owners jointly controlled the surrounding property.\n\"It's an old idea, but new to Ontario,\" added Casey, who said the province had allowed the ownership format for less than a year.\nIt was so new that banks were still figuring out how to finance such purchases.\n\"The one big problem ... is the apparent reluctance of lending institutions to provide financing for these condominium developments,\" said Peter Langer, a real estate developer.\u00a0\nBut he said he expected banks would eventually come around, and more condominium developments would follow.\nCasey said the appeal of condominiums was their lower price compared with traditional single-family dwellings.\nAt one such\u00a0development at Jane Street\u00a0and Finch Avenue\u00a0in northwest\u00a0Toronto, prices started\u00a0at $19,300 with a down payment of $3,400. (That's more than\u00a0$140,000 in 2019 dollars.)\nA renter had told Casey one of the realities of living in a condominium, which he paraphrased\u00a0as the camera showed residents relaxing outside their units.\u00a0\n\"You have to like children.

Her landlord,\u00a0Paval Kanagathurai, bought her building at the corner of King Street West and Cowan Avenue through a numbered company in August 2017.\u00a0\nSoon after, Goldfeder says the landlord started renovating the first floor to turn it into a Domino's Pizza, a process she says involved turning off the heat, which was never fully restored.\n\"It's been horrendous \u2026 I haven't been able to live in my unit for a lot of the winter,\" Goldfeder said. \"It's so cold, it goes down to like 12 to 14 degrees in here and I have four of the portable units on all the time.\"\u00a0\nA Toronto by-law requires landlords to maintain a minimum air temperature of 21 C\u00a0in tenants' units between September and June. Landlords are also not allowed to withhold vital services, like heat, under Ontario's Residential Tenancies Act.\u00a0\nDespite reporting the issue to Municipal Licensing and Standards, and a violation notice issued by the city, Goldfeder says she still doesn't have adequate heat.\u00a0\n\"He's definitely freezing me out so I leave,\" she said.\u00a0\nWhen it gets too cold in her apartment, Goldfeder says she stays with friends who live in the area.\nIn a statement, Kanagathurai told CBC Toronto he does not want to \"comment on matters that are before the courts,\" but the allegations made by his tenants are \"either outright false or otherwise coloured to disguise the truth of the matter.\"\u00a0\nGoldfeder has considered moving, but so far says fighting for heat is still better than looking for affordable rent in Toronto. She pays $750 a month, less than the\u00a0average $1,081 per month rent for a bachelor apartment in Toronto, according to\u00a02018 data from\u00a0Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation (CHMC).\u00a0\nGetting priced out of the city is a fear Goldfeder shares with other tenants facing eviction from the same landlord at 410 Queen Street West.\nCBC Toronto spoke to a tenant from each of that building's three rental units, who've had a potential eviction hanging over their heads for almost a year. The tenants say Kanagathurai turned off the central heating used by two of the three units soon after buying the building\u00a0in December 2018.\u00a0\n\"We'd be sitting in our kitchen with our parkas on and gloves on, like that's how cold it was,\" said Paddy Gallagher, one of the tenants affected. \"He gave us portable heaters \u2026 and they were blowing fuses left and right.\"\nThe landlord installed a new heating system in the units\u00a0a few months ago \u2014\u00a0before an eviction hearing at the\u00a0Landlord Tenant Board (LTB). Kanagathurai\u00a0is trying to evict all of the tenants so that he can personally use the units.\u00a0\nAn affidavit Kanagathurai filed with the LTB for the eviction application\u00a0says the landlord plans to move into the Queen West building with his family to run the Domino's Pizza franchise he opened on the ground floor.\n\"My family has made the decision to move into the building where we work for both financial and family reasons,\" Kanagathurai's affidavit says. \"We will be listing our current family home on the market for sale.\"\u00a0\nChim Kan is another one of the tenants there. When he, Gallagher and others were trying to figure out whether they could fight the eviction notice, Kan discovered that Kanagathurai didn't personally own the building, but instead had bought it through a numbered company.\n\"This landlord is not like a mom and pop shop kind of landlord,\" said Kan. \"He actually owns multiple buildings and he's doing the same thing.\"\nCBC Toronto obtained property and business records that show in total Kanagathurai's companies own a dozen buildings in the city, which each include rental units and a Domino's Pizza franchise.\u00a0\nThe landlord also owns two houses in his name about an hour north-east of Toronto\u00a0that were purchased for more than a million dollars each. \u00a0\nFor the moment, Chan, Gallagher and the other tenants of 410 Queen West aren't going anywhere.\nThe eviction for personal use was dismissed in late December by the LTB because of an amendment that was made to the Residential Tenancies Act in 2017. Since that change was made, rental units owned by a corporation can't evict tenants for personal use.\u00a0\nEarlier this month,\u00a0Kanagathurai offered each unit at 410 Queen West $20,000 to move out, but the tenants rejected that offer, and now the landlord is appealing the LTB decision to Divisional Court.\u00a0\nIn the last four years there's been an 84 per cent increase in private landlords seeking evictions to reclaim a property for their own personal use, and a 294 per cent jump in applications for so-called \"renovictions\" in Toronto, according to an affordable rental housing report released last fall.\u00a0\nThat's part of the reason these eviction attempts don't surprise Parkdale legal worker, Cole Webber.\u00a0\n\"There is a big financial incentive for landlords to get rid of longtime tenants,\" Webber told CBC Toronto. \"Part of the problem is that of course there's insufficient enforcement of the rules.\"\u00a0\nAs a result, Webber says the onus is on tenants to be proactive and put pressure on their landlords themselves.\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of money to be made in real estate in Toronto \u2014\u00a0that's really what it comes down to,\" he said.\nGoldfeder understands that for her landlord\u00a0this is business, but she's still looking for accountability when she heads back to the LTB in March.\u00a0\n\"I think this is disgusting behaviour from human to human,\" Goldfeder said.\n"}, {"author": "Michelle McQuigge", "title": "GTA seniors delaying downsizing, putting housing squeeze on younger people: study", "description": "Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation analyzed 10 years of housing data for GTA residents 65+", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/seniors-toronto-housing-cmhc-1.5240953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4096701.1493784068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-real-estate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 08, 2019 7:13 PM ET", "2019-08-08T23:13:15.244Z"], "source": null, "content": "A growing trend among Toronto-area seniors to delay downsizing efforts and remain in their homes for longer could indicate future housing pressures for younger generations, a new report said Thursday.\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation analyzed 10 years\u00a0worth of housing data among residents of the Greater Toronto Area\u00a0aged 65 or over, evaluating how many opted to remain in the real\u00a0estate market.\nThe report found that seniors were more likely to be home owners in 2016 than they were in 2006, noting they made up 25 per cent of\u00a0local homeowners compared to 20 per cent a decade before.\u00a0\n\"Housing is a continuum,\" Breidburg said in a telephone\u00a0interview. \"If seniors don't sell their homes, eventually it limits supply for all further generations ...

Because each of those thousands of rotting avocados was \"contaminated\" by a little plastic PLU (or price\u00a0look up) sticker. It carries a number, standardized around the globe, that identifies the type of produce and whether it's conventionally or organically grown, to help cashiers enter the right price at the supermarket checkout.\nJane Proctor, vice-president of policy and issue management at the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, said while the stickers are voluntary, most chain supermarkets require them. \"It is not a regulatory requirement,\" she said. \"It's a business requirement.\"\nThe stickers are too small to be screened out in the waste sorting process, but don't break down during composting. Antler said they end up sprinkled as \"foreign matter\" through the finished product \u2014 compost that's destined to be used to enrich soils in places such as gardens, farmland and parks.\u00a0\nThe stickers aren't toxic and don't harm the compost \u2014 although presumably they add microplastics to the environment \u2014 so it's mostly a cosmetic issue, Antler acknowledged. But there are strict guidelines about how much foreign matter is allowed in compost, especially higher grades. And too much can make compost unmarketable.\nMindful of the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out,\" composting plants that want to produce and sell higher grades of compost need to be careful about what raw materials they take.\nIn the case of the B.C. facility, Antler offered to remove the stickers from the avocados, but the composting plant manager declined. \"He just sent the truck away, so that material went to landfill.\" She's pretty sure it happens all the time. \"The scale of waste is massive.\"\nIt's not just a waste \u2014 it could also speed up climate change.\u00a0\nAt a compost plant, organic matter typically decomposes in the presence of oxygen, generating CO2 and compost that can nourish plants. At a landfill, it decomposes without oxygen into methane, a greenhouse gas that has about 30 times the global warming impact of CO2 over a century. (Some organics plants use anaerobic digestion, which also generates methane, but it is captured and burned so it doesn't go into the atmosphere.)\nBut there are solutions, including other ways to affix the PLU to bulk fruits and veggies, such as:\nPaper stickers or certified compostable plastic stickers, which have been successfully tested in the U.S.\nInk stamps like the ones used to label eggs.\n\"Branding\" with lasers.\nProctor said produce sellers often don't see the extra investment as worthwhile when many customers don't have access to municipal composting. She added that the recent introduction of scannable barcodes on PLU stickers \u2014 which Canadian stores are expected to adopt soon \u2014 requires the labels to show fine detail and maintain durability, which only plastic enables.\nIn the meantime, you can help by making sure you take the little stickers off your fruit and veggie peels and rinds before tossing them in your green bin at home.\n\u2014 Emily Chung\nEmily Chung's piece on wood buildings last week garnered a lot of feedback from readers, some of whom were concerned about the safety of the material itself. \"I have reservations regarding wooden highrise buildings,\" said Bob Miller. \"These include: Wood burns. Wood is not recyclable. Wood is subject to rot.\"\nThis article from last year highlights the concerns of some fire chiefs and also includes a comment from a senior researcher at Natural Resources Canada.\nOther readers were concerned about where all the wood would come from.\n\"Are you seriously promoting the denuding of our planet's trees as a green solution! Methinks this is seriously flawed logic,\" wrote Simon Faunt.\n\"We already cut and clear-cut, unfortunately, too many forests,\" said Joan Thompson. \"Can and will we replant enough trees to maintain the natural wildlife spaces, clean our air and prevent soil erosion... I'm not sure. We build and we build and we build. There are no restrictions. We need to consider each option carefully \u2014 pros and cons.\"\nLast week in this space, we discussed the stock market slide for a number of the best-known oil and gas companies. This week, we're highlighting some of the biggest players in lithium-ion battery storage, which will be a key industry in the global transition away from fossil fuels. All of these companies supply car manufacturers (as well as electric utilities). In addition to upstart Tesla, there are a couple of Chinese newcomers \u2014 Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD \u2014 as well as more established names like South Korea's LG Chem and Japan's Panasonic. The chart below reflects 2018 figures for each company's total storage capacity.\nOil companies are having a rough spell, and so are countries dependent on the profits from extracting oil. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, as fossil fuel demand decreases, the wealth of Gulf oil producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could dry up in 15 years. \nBrad McLaughlin says it should be easy for a northern country like Canada to build the kind of home that is so efficient it makes more energy than it uses.\nBut McLaughlin, the general manager of MCL Construction Ltd. in Quispamsis, N.B., is beginning to wonder if reducing residential greenhouse gases is really a priority in this country.\nHis certified net-zero home has maxed out energy efficiency. The house has insulated concrete walls, triple glazed windows, 44 solar panels and a backup rechargeable battery system.\nOn a sub-zero February afternoon, it's sending excess electricity back to the provincial grid in exchange for NB Power credits to be used on the coldest days, or at night when the sun is down.\nBut the three-bedroom, two-bath home stubbornly refuses to sell. It has been on and off the real estate market since 2017.\n\"It hasn't moved,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a lot of people through it.\"\u00a0\nStarting out, McLaughlin's asking price was $695,000. By May 2019, he had lowered it to $570,000. This week, he put the two-storey house back on the market at $495,000.\nMcLaughlin points to mortgage \"stress tests\" and indifference from bank-hired appraisers as obstacles pushing buyers away from these higher-than-average priced homes. McLaughlin feels the federal government could do more to kick-start construction of these kinds of homes.\nHis first suggestion would be to revamp the mortgage stress test introduced to cool red-hot housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto. McLaughlin said the test lacks flexibility and is locking people out of the net-zero-carbon housing market by denying them mortgages for homes with higher purchase prices, without allowing for the fact the buyer won't have any heating and electricity costs.\nHe said appraisers are at a loss when it comes to a sustainable house like this.\n\"Around here, they just don't know how to value it.\u2026They just say, 'Well, there's a similar house down the street,'\" he said. \"Well, sure it might look the same, but it's a lot different.\"\nMcLaughlin isn't alone in his thinking. The Canadian Home Builders Association and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) are also calling for changes to the system. CREA national president Jason Stephen, who is a Saint John realtor, said the stress test should be adjusted to suit regional markets across the country.\n\"If this was a system that was brought in to address escalating housing prices, month over month, or year over year, we just don't have that, which is why we always say there's not one housing market [across] the whole country,\" Stephen said.\nDuring the 2019 election campaign, the federal Liberals promised to introduce a $5,000 grant to buyers of net-zero homes and to offer interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to homeowners and landlords for energy saving retrofits. The program has yet to be introduced.\nOther efficiency programs are already available to builders and buyers in New Brunswick.

We saw inventories build and prices trend downwards.\u00a0However, things appear to have changed since then.\nAccording to the Canadian Real Estate Association, national home prices have increased for six consecutive months. The national home price index is up by 0.9 per cent\u00a0since August 2019.\nEconomists from RBC and Sotheby's have declared the housing correction over and expect a gradual rebound over the near term.\u00a0Homes priced up to $1 million have seen an uptick in selling activity,\u00a0whereas the higher priced luxury market, which has been hit the hardest, remains soft.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the spring, sentiment around real estate has improved. Interest rates have been dropping and prices have adjusted downwards. This means that buyers can afford more \"house\" compared to last year.\nThere is also a greater sense of urgency to purchase compared to last spring due to the China/Hong Kong conflict.\u00a0Some fear that if the conflict escalates, as many as 300,000 Hong Kong/Canadian dual citizens could flood our local market and drive up prices.\u00a0\nIt's hard to generalize our real estate market.\u00a0 It isn't one \"Lower Mainland\" market \u2014 it is more like 30 submarkets. Overall, I'd say it is more or less balanced, with lots of hot and cold pockets. It really depends on the location and price point.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPre-sales and newly built condos aren't selling very well.\u00a0Not only is there currently a large number available on the market, there are more expected over the next year.\nSeveral pre-sale projects have been cancelled due to a lack of demand with some developers needing to offer incentives to entice buyers.\u00a0\nThis past June, a developer was famously offering buyers a years' worth of avocado toast, but since then they have had to up the ante. Now, instead of toast, one developer is giving away a Telsa worth $55K with every home purchase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother area not doing well is the luxury market. This has been the hardest hit with price drops, in some areas, of 40 per cent. The main reason for the lack of buyers is that, despite the 40 per cent\u00a0price drop, the luxury market is still expensive. A home worth $7 million\u00a0in 2017 would still cost over $4 million\u00a0today,\u00a0a price few can afford.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose buying in the luxury market in 2017 were often foreign buyers and that market has completely dried up.\u00a0Many have suggested that foreign buyers used our real estate market as a bank account. Well, instead of making deposits, they are now making withdrawals.\u00a0\nFor the first time in decades, the Chinese have become net sellers of global assets, which includes Vancouver real estate. As a result of this behavioural change, the areas of our market that were popular with foreign investors are now struggling.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother consideration that will have an impact on real estate is the upcoming election. Exactly how the election will affect housing is hard to quantify as we don't know who will win, whether they will follow through with their pre-election promises or, if they do, how fast they implement their plan.\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not rushing into this market even if some experts say that it has bottomed.\u00a0It can bounce along the bottom for quite some time. It is rare that you see a V-shaped recovery with real estate unless there was a major crash.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the end of the day I use spreadsheets. If the math works, be it a home for you to live in or a revenue property,\u00a0then I would be inclined to go through with a deal.\u00a0If the math doesn't work, then be patient and try again when the numbers make more sense.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The eldest had entered the workforce and were laid off in the period after the 2008 market crash. Those who graduated in the late aughts recall the sparse job offerings and widespread financial anxiety. As a result, they're feeling more prepared for whatever's coming now.\nThe Canadian Press spoke to three Canadian millennials on what they learned during their first recession and how to get through the current one.\nDon't be too hard on yourself, says one Toronto financial counsellor.\nThirty-four-year-old Jessica Moorhouse spent the majority of her first year in the working world unemployed.\nShe graduated from Simon Fraser University with a degree in film in 2009. Though she'd heard whisperings from her parents and older friends about the toll the 2008 housing crisis had taken on the country, Moorhouse didn't expect to face a job market as stripped of job prospects as the one she saw.\n\"As I was approaching that graduation deadline, then I kind of realized, 'this seems a little bit harder,\"' Moorhouse says. She lived with her parents for a stint to save money while passing out resumes, all the while thinking, \"this is not the future I was promised after studying and working so hard and getting a degree.\"\nShe eventually found work at a Vancouver-based newspaper, where she stayed for three years, making just enough to move out of her parent's house and into a basement suite with two roommates. \"It was tough. I was broke,\" Moorhouse says.\nGrowing tired of living paycheque to paycheque, she began reading personal finance blogs and books on investing, and eventually completed a digital marketing certificate program and built a career as a financial counsellor and blogger.\nMoorhouse says researching past financial crises \u2014 including the forces behind market crashes and the course of their inevitable rebounds \u2014 brought her a sense of comfort through the darker hours of the 2008 recession.\n\"Give yourself that kind of background that this isn't the first time this has ever happened. It's the first time it's happened to you, but not the first time in history,\" she says. \"Hold tight for a few years and you're going to be just fine.\"\nMoorhouse also says it's important to be kind to yourself if you're experiencing financial strain, as finding ways to make spare cash under lockdown orders is virtually impossible.\n\"Cut yourself a bit of a break, realize this is special, and it's not your fault,\" she says.\nFor Calgary web designer Nick Heer, resourcefulness is key.\nAt just 30 years old, Heer says the current recession is the third he's experienced in his adult life.\nThe Calgary-based web designer turned 18 as the market was crashing in 2008. He graduated from university in 2014, just as his province's economy took a sharp downturn due to plunging oil prices. Understandably, applying for jobs was a challenge.\n\"I sent out resumes for, I don't know, probably like 50 jobs,\" Heer says. \"And I got one call back.\"\nFortunately, that interview turned into a job. \"I've been really lucky,\" he admits. But looking back, he says the amount of economic turmoil he's witnessed in little over a decade is troubling.\n\"Something is deeply wrong if I've gone through this three times in my adult life,\" he says.\nHeer says it's difficult to dole out financial advice in periods when the population is in survival mode. But if there's one thing he's found to be central to making it through a recession, it's resourcefulness.\n\"Every piece of financial advice that I have been given has had to be stretched out or maximized in some way,\" Heer says. \"It's no longer enough to save a little bit every paycheque for a short-ish period of uncertainty. It's now necessary to save more for more uncertainty.\"\nVancouver-based animator Amanda Wong's advice is to stay busy.\nWong graduated from design school in 2009, at a time when \"there were absolutely no entry points for new graduates\" in her industry.\nNow 36, Wong says she had to rely on her background in commerce (for which she earned a bachelor's degree prior to venturing into animation) to get through the recession. She got a job in marketing at the Vancouver Film School, where she spent a year. Eventually, she was able to pivot back into the work she wanted to be doing, but says many of her classmates weren't as lucky.\n\"There was at least a third that never made it into the industry,\" Wong says, noting that in recent years, prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus, she's seen graduating classes at major film schools achieve hiring rates closer to 90 or 100 per cent.\nWong says it's important not to blame yourself if you're struggling financially at the moment. With the job market tenuous and many working conditions unsafe, the most productive way to get through the coming recession will be to enhance your employability.\n\"Go to a resume workshop. Network. Try to keep yourself busy with an individual project to boost your portfolio,\" Wong suggests. \"It's important to keep your mental health up and not blame yourself too much for worldwide economic conditions that you cannot control.\"\n"}, {"author": "Andrea Ross", "title": "The first baby born in B.C. in 2000 is hopeful and a little wary about the next decade", "description": "Bradley Parks is doing what generations before him did: working hard and learning more.

In the two decades since, his childhood and future prospects have been shaped by the global financial crisis, the advent of the iPhone, social media and accelerating climate change.\nToday, he turns 20. He works as a car mechanic and as he\u00a0enters a new decade, he's considering his prospects for education, a relationship, and the idea of someday buying a house.\u00a0\nHe's\u00a0bracing for challenges\u00a0previous generations didn't have to face.\n\"It's really difficult to be able to afford things nowadays,\" said Parks, who lives with his parents in White Rock.\u00a0\n\"The whole economy has made it super difficult to live day-by-day.\"\nThe cost of living has risen for everyone, but it'll be harder than ever for post-millennials like Parks to achieve the milestones of previous generations, like buying property.\nIn 2000, the average price of a single family home in the Greater Vancouver real estate area was $376,000. Adjusted for inflation today, that would be about $533,000.\nThe average price of a single family home in November 2019 was $1.57\u00a0million.\u00a0\nBecause wages haven't caught up, working harder won't make up for the glaring difference, said Paul Kershaw, a policy professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of advocacy group Generation Squeeze.\n\"Gen Xers had the worst earnings, but home prices hadn't gone up as crazy as they have now,\" Kershaw said.\n\"Millennials had better earnings than Xers but they had much more challenging home prices. And now you've got post-millennials \u2026 they're inheriting both: challenging earnings and really frightening home prices.\"\nA common sentiment across generations is the desire for security, Kershaw said. But a lack of focus on protecting the environment, investment in child care and parental leave, inflated housing prices and stagnant wages have led to a \"bad generational deal\" for younger Canadians and future generations, he added.\u00a0\nBut it's not all bad news \u2014 Kershaw says the challenges post-millennials will face in the coming years can be eased if older generations \"squeeze back\" by re-evaluating societal goals and how we support one another.\n\"We cannot individually work our way out of this squeeze between time, money, service and environmental pressure,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We can only really do it collectively by changing the system which we're inheriting.\"\nParks wants to stay in B.C. and hopes to own a house and have a family someday. To achieve those goals, he's doing what generations before him have done.\n\"Working hard, learning more,\" he said.\u00a0\nIn the next decade, he's is looking forward to earning his Red Seal in the trades, recognized as the standard of excellence in training in the industry.\nFor the first baby born in B.C. when the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1, 2020, his advice is to not grow up too fast.\n\"Do what you want to do. Study\u00a0hard in school. Do whatever you want to do but just make sure that it will support you in what you want in life,\" he said.\n\"Enjoy being a kid while it lasts, because it changes pretty quickly on you.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Anti-poverty group wants vacant downtown properties turned into affordable housing", "description": "Mayor John Tory says 11 sites already identified for conversion to affordable housing, report coming this fall", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sherbourne-affordable-housing-toronto-1.5198883", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5199162.1562189811!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/214-230-sherbourne-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 03, 2019 6:09 PM ET", "2019-07-04T00:27:58.700Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group of anti-poverty activists is urging the city to expropriate a section of land in the Cabbagetown area before it's sold to developers in an effort to combat a lack of affordable housing in Toronto.\nAt a media conference at city hall Wednesday, the group, including\u00a0architects, academics and organizers with the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), put forth a plan to build up to 260 rent-geared-to-income public housing units at 214-230 Sherbourne St., a series of seven properties currently sitting vacant in the area.\nAmong the properties is one\u00a01900s-era building\u00a0long home to rooming houses, now largely empty.\u00a0The group says the properties' owners put the buildings up for sale in 2018, but later took them off the market after city council considered purchasing them.

But once the effects of the\u00a0pandemic begin to wane, there are fears in some quarters that the massive government spending could lead to inflation. That would mean\u00a0a confusing and uncertain outcome.\nAfter more than a decade in which official measures of rising prices showed inflation close to zero, a return to rising prices, and the rising interest rates that central banks have traditionally used to contain them, could well upend the way we think about money and investment.\nNot only are\u00a0central banks lowering rates and buying up bonds in the hope\u00a0bond holders\u00a0do something else with the money,\u00a0governments around the world are spending trillions of dollars they don't have to keep households and businesses solvent.\n\"Let's just call this simply what's going on. We're printing a lot of money to provide liquidity in the system,\" former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge told David Parkinson at the Report on Business last week.\nWhile Dodge agreed that the Bank of Canada's plan to pour money into the economy with quantitative easing\u00a0(QE) was the right thing to do, he said there will be consequences.\nQE\u00a0may be hard for most people to grasp intuitively, although some of us will be familiar with the term from when the U.S. and Europe flooded markets with cash to prevent the 2008 credit crunch from spiralling into something worse.\nIn an era when almost all money consists of digits in computers, when the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz began QE last Wednesday, he wasn't actually \"printing\" $100 bills. What the bank did was conjure a billion dollars into existence and used it to buy bonds on the market.\n\"It is the last best trick our governments have to save the good ship economy,\" economist Armine Yalnizyan once told Michael Enright on CBC Radio's Sunday Edition in an explanation of QE that stands the test of time.\nBut, of course, the Bank of Canada is not the only source of cash flooding into the Canadian and world economy.\nGovernments around the world are\u00a0borrowing from the future and running up deficits at levels not seen since the Second World War as they hand\u00a0out emergency aid to businesses and ordinary people.\nIn the short term, with so many people out of work and whole industries in contraction, inflation is the least of our worries.\nOne of the reasons for all that government spending is to prevent the exact opposite of inflation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a spiral of deflation. Aggregate prices could fall because of the crash in demand as people stop buying, not just gas and plane rides and cars and houses, but the industrial inputs that go into their creation.\nMost economists worry that\u00a0deflation is much worse for an economy than inflation because, rather than spending their money, consumers can benefit by holding off until prices are lower, leading to even lower demand.\nBut like everything else about this unprecedented pandemic and the unprecedented government reaction, it is not entirely certain what the longer term effects will be.\n\"Though it seems like deflationary end times to some right now, the COVID-19 scare is going to pass, and we will be left with monetary and fiscal bazookas having been fired,\" worries market analyst Gary Tanashian on the site Seeking Alpha.\nOnce a government has started pouring stimulus money into an economy, it is notoriously hard to start pulling it back out again, especially, as in the U.S. case, during a presidential election year. Similar forces will be at work in Canada where, because of the Liberal minority government, an election could happen at any time.\nTanashian suggests the inflation is already happening now, but is disguised by the temporary COVID-caused crash in demand. And once the lockdown begins to lift and everyone roars back to working and shopping and eating out, there will be too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. And that's the classic definition of inflation, which he sees showing itself by the end of 2020, and surging over the next two years.\nIf we do see a return to inflation,\u00a0it's hard to predict how it will play out. But central banks likely will start raising rates to keep it in hand.\nExisting bonds,\u00a0a great investment over the past decade as interest rates fell lower and lower, will no longer be good to hold. The value of assets such as housing will fall as borrowing costs rise. Outstanding consumer loans will become a bigger burden.\nEmployment incomes that rise with inflation will be a better source of money for the working young than cash piles held by the rich and old. Spending money now will be better than waiting, because the price of things you want will go nowhere but up. And a generation who's never seen it will have to figure out inflation all over again.\nFollow Don @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "London's weather, traffic and gas prices for Friday", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-s-weather-traffic-and-gas-prices-for-friday-1.5334871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334875.1571996138!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/pumpkins-o-plenty.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Oct 25, 2019 5:47 AM ET", "2019-10-25T09:47:24.535Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Thank you Donna Currie\u00a0for this Fall photo of pumpkins at a local nursery.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can share your pictures with us by emailing them to londonmorning@cbc.ca.\u00a0\nTop Story:\u00a0Local elementary teachers hold a strike vote.

It often boils down to two emotions \u2014 greed or fear.\nIn our current market it's all about fear. Buyers hope to find a seller who has had a house on the market for some time and who is reading all\u00a0the negative headlines about\u00a0the housing market. They\u00a0want a seller to agree to their low offer\u00a0out of fear. Buyers need a compelling narrative, backed by data, to convince sellers that the longer they wait, the worse it could get. \u00a0\u00a0\nBy feeding into the seller's fear of a price collapse, a buyer hopes they capitulate and take\u00a0the \"bird in the hand\" low-ball offer. And buyers have a number of arguments at their disposal.\nB.C. Finance Minister Carole James vowed to stop money laundering which, in her words, has hiked real estate prices by 20 per cent\u00a0in certain parts of Vancouver. This, combined with the mortgage stress test, the foreign buyer's tax, school and speculator tax, have all\u00a0reduced demand.\nReal estate is a numbers game. Many sellers reject initial offers they see as too low, so buyers need to continue to negotiate or just move on until they find the right deal. It's currently a buyers' market so there is no need to rush a purchase.\nI believe that real estate values will continue to rise over time as it is very expensive to build a home or condo in the Lower Mainland. \u00a0Back in 2011, I built two homes at a build cost of $100 per square foot, not including the price of land. To build similar homes today it would cost over $300 per square foot.\u00a0In just eight\u00a0years the cost to build has tripled due to higher labour and\u00a0material costs\u00a0and new regulations.\nRecently several developers cancelled or delayed projects citing cost as the reason. If this trend continues, once the current stock of condos is sold, we could experience a lack of housing inventory in a couple of years.\u00a0It is at this point in the real estate cycle when demand outstrips supply and prices start to rise.\nOne group that I believe should take advantage of our current market are the owners of two- or three-bedroom condos and townhouses who are looking to upgrade to single family homes.\nOver the past three\u00a0years, the price of townhouses has been increasing while single family homes were trending down. If these owners sell their townhouse, they would be able to buy a lot more house today than they could have two or three years ago.\u00a0\nAnother group who should consider buying are those who are looking to buy a home to live in for at least five\u00a0years.\u00a0Prices could continue to trend down for a couple more years, but they will rebound. If you negotiate a good deal and are happy living in your home, then you needn't worry about the short-term fluctuations.\nFor people looking to be landlords, it's a much harder call. It is very tough to make the numbers work to justify the headaches of owning a revenue property.\u00a0Unless you get an amazing deal\u00a0or are an experienced landlord, you might want to take a \"wait and see\" approach.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

cities in Western Canada generally saw prices drop.\nPorter said global uncertainties are already driving borrowing costs lower, which could further boost the Canadian market, but if economic declines prove serious then interest rates will be secondary.\n\"The downside is that if global uncertainties\u00a0morph into something much more serious for the domestic economy, interest rates will be playing a second fiddle.\"\nTD senior economist James Marple said the housing market looked robust for the month, supported by strong population growth, solid job growth and lower mortgage rates.\n\"This can only be described as a solid month for the Canadian housing market ... with most markets in balanced territory or better, the immediate downside risk to home prices have diminished considerably.\"\nHe said there is some uncertainty as to where rates will go, since domestically the economy looks strong while there are considerable international challenges as global economic growth looks even softer than previously thought.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2683744399", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null,

Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin met with Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest\u00a0Thursday to propose ways the province could help out.\u00a0\n\"We have a crisis within a crisis,\" Pedneaud-Jobin said.\nThe mayor said the city was already short before the floods of 2017 and 2019 and the 2018 tornadoes, the latter wiping out\u00a01,600 housing\u00a0units alone.\nPedneaud-Jobin said it's harder than ever\u00a0for people to find proper affordable housing.\nThe latest numbers from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation show a rental vacancy rate of only 1.2 percent in Gatineau as of\u00a0November, down from 3.8 per cent the previous year.\nIt's below the provincial average of 2.3 per cent for communities larger than 10,000 people.\nThe province announced Thursday it's investing more than $6 million for the construction of 75 housing units, many\u00a0for families in\u00a0Aylmer.\nThe first\u00a0will provide 30 new housing units in six buildings on rue Desch\u00eanes\u00a0for families only, particularly those with several children, and should be completed in the fall of 2020.\nThe second project adds 45 housing units in the western part of the Plateau.\u00a0Work has already begun and the first tenants are expected to move in early 2020.\nGatineau is contributing more than $1.8 million.\nThe mayor says this\u00a0investment will help, but it won't solve the problem on its own.\n\"We're far from a solution, we would need hundreds more units,\" he said.\nHe said he's asked the government to adapt the provincial program to help build units that make sense for Gatineau's local reality.\n\"The program recognizes construction costs that are the same all over Quebec, but it's way more expensive in Gatineau to build,\" he said.\nFor him, the key to helping solve the affordable housing is in the long term.\n\"That would be a huge step for [developers] to move faster to give us more units because that's basically the real solution,\" he said.\nHe also said the government must invest in rental subsidies in places where people can't find affordable housing, with the government footing the difference in cost for up to five years until people can find available units.\nMunicipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest said she is satisfied with the working meeting she had Thursday abut how to tackle Gatineau's housing crisis.\n\"Our government is listening to the needs of our citizens.\" Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest said.\n\"We're working together to find the best possible solutions

Westbank covered the entire cost of the chandelier and is\u00a0on the hook for any maintenance.\u00a0\nAs part of the city's\u00a0rezoning conditions, Westbank\u00a0will contribute 106 new rental homes and more than $21 million in\u00a0levies to the city.\nUnits in the Vancouver House, however,\u00a0cater to the wealthy: A three-bedroom unit is listed at $6.9 million, while a two-bedroom penthouse is up for nearly $9 million.\nThe development has\u00a0drawn\u00a0a flurry of activity to\u00a0a historically industrial area, where the homeless have often sought refuge\u00a0under the bridge.\nEric Fredericksen, head of public art for the City of Vancouver, said\u00a0the chandelier will bring more people to the\u00a0\"rough and functional\" space. But he's\u00a0mindful of the criticism.\n\"For the artist, I think he was thinking more abstractly about the sculpture and the light possibilities in the chandelier. I'm not sure how much the social implications are in there,\" Fredericksen\u00a0said.\n\"But they are there now and I think they'll be part of the reading of the piece, which is a spectacular object. I'm curious as to how that conversation will play out over time.\"\nFor some, the chandelier is best viewed as a feat of design. Desmond Williams, a 59-year-old engineer, scrutinized the chandelier as crews tested out the chandelier.\n\"I don't know if it's the best public art that I would see for this area. I haven't decided,\" Williams said.\nJust then, the chandelier began to spin, its crystals flaring out like\u00a0wings. Williams' face lit up.\n\"Already I'm liking it,\" he said. \"I think with light, it could be really cool.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1563094595933", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Antoni Nerestant", "title": "Surging rent costs push families to choose between housing and food, says advocate", "description": "The Benedict Labre House says there has been a surge in demand for food baskets in the last year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/surging-rent-costs-driving-demand-for-food-assistance-1.5440795", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5440807.1580071876!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/12.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 27, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-01-27T10:00:00.260Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Benedict Labre House is used to distributing food to people in need, but not like this.\nSince the nearly 70-year-old day centre\u00a0moved from Griffintown to Saint-Henri in 2018, organizers say the demand for its food bank has quadrupled.\u00a0\nThey've gone from handing out 50 food baskets a month to more than 200.\nThe community organization\u00a0even had to set a monthly limit of one basket for each client to make sure everyone would be able to get food.\n\"We would like to be able to give them food every single week, but we just don't have enough,\" said clinical coordinator Francine Nadler.\nNadler says demand isn't just driven by homeless clients.

When she looked her a hotel-room-sized unit, all she could think was: \"This can't be me. This can't be the kind of place I live.\"\u00a0\nHer family had paid for the apartment's down payment and though Andresen is paying the mortgage, the arrangement left her with a lingering guilt.\n\"I was used to living in informal housing situations,\" said Andresen. \"It made me feel guilty because I related to my peers who had problems with cockroaches and mould and crazy landlords. And then here I am like the master of my own castle.\"\nAndresen said she found it particularly hard to accept because her partner Michelle Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 30,\u00a0is a former foster child, who wouldn't\u00a0have the same opportunity.\u00a0\nHer partner has joked she has \"co-opted\" Andresen's family, and gets the benefits from being a part of it.\u00a0\n\"She enjoys that, but [the apartment] is definitely a privilege,\" said Andresen of her family's gift. \"It is unearned, undeserved, pretty much unfair.\"\nAndresen had never expected to own a home, even the small condo where she is living.\u00a0Prior to heading to Australia to finish her bachelor's degree, she said she had accepted the idea of renting for the rest of her life.\u00a0\nHer family used to live in Metro Vancouver, where housing prices have skyrocketed in the last decade \u2014 though there have been recent signs of a decline.\u00a0\nHer mother and grandparents decided to sell their homes in the midst of the boom to move to Vancouver Island. But there was enough extra to give Niki and her brother money for their down payment.\u00a0\nAndresen was still in Australia when the sale happened, and was surprised to hear her mother offering to buy her an apartment in a new city.\u00a0\nShe said initially, she didn't take the idea of owning a home too seriously. She was heading into an unpaid internship, and had to drop a paying job to take it. She said she was having trouble affording food.\nWhen her mother suggested that she'd accrue some rent money if she had an apartment, Andresen took the chance.\n\"It was a feeling of just sort of confusion and then like an acceptance because how can you turn down a gift that amazing?\" said Andresen.\u00a0\n\"Especially when I know who it's coming from and how much it matters to my family that I have a place to stay and housing security.\"\nAndresen said she's especially thankful, considering the rental vacancy rate in Victoria is just 1.2 per cent.\u00a0\nGiven the tight market, she said she's resolved to share how she purchased that apartment with anyone who asks.\u00a0\n\"I think it's important to talk about where the money comes from in the sense that it highlights who is able to access housing right now,\" said Andresen.\u00a0\nThis view is shared by Harper's Bazaar online contributor Jen Doll, who wrote about how the idea of self-made success is often a myth.\u00a0\nPeople like to believe that if you're good enough, you can start a business, buy a home, and live a great life.\u00a0\n\"What does it mean to be good enough? Generally it means that you probably have been privileged in some way or another,\" said Doll. \u00a0\n\"And if you're not that's the other thing, the other side of this. If you are really able to pretty much come from nothing and make yourself something \u2014 that deserves so much more acclaim.\"\nIn 2011, Doll faced a similar conundrum as Andresen. Her parents offered her proposition: they could give her the money for 10 per cent of a down payment in New York City now, or after they died.\u00a0\nShe took the money, bought the apartment and until recently kept quiet about how she was able to afford it. Now, she is trying to share how the story when she can, but said that finding the ideal setting for this conversation can be hard.\n\"What I pull people aside in the break room and tell them, 'Hey, guess what?'\" said Doll, imagining how she could broach the subject with colleagues. \"We don't walk around with debt and assets on our faces.\"\nMeanwhile, Andresen has been considering new ways to conceive of success, that don't favour people who have rich parents. One idea, she suggested, would be to stop viewing wealth as a measure of success altogether. In that case, big purchases, like buying a home, would no longer be seen as markers of an individual's accomplishments.\u00a0\nShe pointed to a quote by the former mayor of Bogota, Gustavo Petro: \"A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.\"\nIn Canada, Andresen said, Petro's ideal is reversed.\u00a0\nAndresen said society, generally, would benefit if we shift our priorities away from material wealth and consumption. She said reevaluating our priorities is especially critical now, in the context of the housing crisis.\u00a0\nFor our full interview with Jen Doll and for more of Niki Andresen's story, hit the Listen button above.\nClarification: This article referenced a person who did not contribute to Andresen's down payment as being one of the donators.\u00a0It has since been removed.\n"}, {"author": "Sidney Cohen", "title": "'We are not in a crisis': New N.W.T. government delivers $1.9B budget", "description": "Fiscal situation is 'not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,' says finance minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/19th-legislative-assembly-first-budget-1.5475739", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475778.1583192022!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/caroline-wawzonek.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 3:54 PM CT", "2020-02-28T21:31:31.452Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Northwest Territories government proposes to spend $1.9 billion on operational costs in the next fiscal year, but little new funding has been allocated in key areas said to be in crisis by several residents, advocates and front-line government workers.\nThe proposed budget includes no major spending increases in the Child and Family Services division or Education, and a decrease in spending on the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation.\nAhead of her budget speech, Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek told reporters the money that is being spent in these areas are amounts that departments need in order run existing programs. It's \"not reflective, necessarily\" of the government's 22 new mandate priorities, she said.\u00a0\nAccording to this budget, the government plans to spend $25 million on its mandate goals over the next three and a half years of this Legislative Assembly, $10 million of which it proposes spending in the upcoming fiscal year.\u00a0\n\"Anyone in government is going to sit here and say we'd always like to have more money,\" said Wawzonek, adding that it's what government does with the money it has that matters.\u00a0\n\"The Northwest Territories economy is stable, but it is not growing,\" Wawzonek said in her budget speech on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith that in mind, the government is proposing to spend $1.983 billion on operational costs in the 2020-21 fiscal year, up from the $1.87 billion it pitched to spend in the year prior. Meanwhile, it's projecting to make about $2.186 billion in revenues.\nThough the government expects to bring in about $203 million more than it will spend on delivering programs and services in the next fiscal year, this doesn't mean it's sitting on a pile of extra cash.\nThat operating surplus will be put toward the $398.6-million capital budget, which has already been approved by the assembly.\nThis leaves the government with a cash deficit of $195.6 million \u2014 money it will have to borrow, pushing the territory closer to its federally-imposed borrowing limit.\nThe government estimates its borrowing will reach nearly $1.2 billion in 2020-21. The debt cap is set at $1.3 billion.\u00a0\nFinance officials said on Tuesday that the government is in talks with the federal government about raising the borrowing limit, which last went up in 2015.\u00a0\n\"Our immediate fiscal situation is not what was hoped in the last budget but it is manageable,\" Wawzonek told the legislative assembly.\n\"We are not in a crisis.\"\nThere are no new taxes in the 2020-21\u00a0budget, but finance officials said property tax mill rates in the smaller communities that don't collect their own property taxes, and in \"the hinterland\" which includes the diamond mines, as well as some fees, will rise with inflation on April 1.\nThe vast majority of the government's revenues \u2014 82 per cent \u2014 is expected to come from the federal government. This includes a $1.4-billion territorial formula financing payment, which is meant to help the territorial government administer programs and services comparable to those in the provinces.\nAs was always the plan, the carbon tax will rise to $30 per carbon-equivalent tonne of greenhouse gas emissions on July 1, with plans to return a majority of that money through rebates\u00a0to residents and businesses.\nNotably, the government raised just $317,000 from the cannabis excise tax in 2019-20, less than half of what it initially projected. This coming year, it expects to bring in $331,000 from cannabis sales.\u00a0\nThe government also estimates it will get about $33 million in royalties and fees from mining and oil and gas operations. This is down about $6 million from 2019-20 estimates.\u00a0\nFinance officials said the decrease is due in part to market conditions, and to discrepancies in forecasting by the companies themselves.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose looking for major changes in the areas of education, child and family services or housing, won't find them in this budget.\nDespite public and internal outcry over a Child and Family Services division in which staff say they are overworked and under-resourced, the government proposes increasing the division's budget by just $280,000 from the year before.\nEarlier this month, the Department of Education, Culture and Employment was subject to a critical review of the Auditor General of Canada, in which it was called out for not providing all students in the territory equal access to quality education.\nIt's unclear whether any changes were made to this budget as a result, but the budget does propose $604,000 to bring the Northern Distance Learning program \u2014 in which students take courses that aren't offered in their own schools via video conferencing \u2014 to five more schools.\nThere is also $129,000 to expand \"northern studies curricula.\"\nTo the NWT\u00a0Housing Corporation, the government is planning to contribute about $2 million less than it did in the previous fiscal year. The corporation does plan to spend $2.2 million more on minor renovations to its housing stock.\nWhile education officials and others have lamented the slow pace of change in government, Wawzonek said she takes a different view.\n\"Sometimes I think acting too quickly is the reaction of government,\" she told reporters.\n\"The approach that we want to take is to actually stand up and take the criticism of not acting fast enough and instead take the time to make sure that we're using our money the best possible way.\"\nAfter a near-strike and renewed collective bargaining, the government will spend $39 million more on wages for unionized employees.\n$3.9 million for 72 long-term care beds in Yellowknife, which will be set up in the old Stanton Territorial Hospital building.\n$1.9\u00a0million for air tanker fleet operations to fight wildfires.\n$2.5\u00a0million for running the new Stanton Territorial Hospital, which includes money for orderlies, behavioural health workers, lab services and more.\n$268,000 to promote N.W.T. as a tourist destination.\n$1.6 million to support the RCMP.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "COVID-19 unknowns leave economy dazed and wobbly: Don Pittis", "description": "It is certain the world will recover, but doubts remain over when and how", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economy-paralysis-1.5499388", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5499595.1584392173!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/health-coronavirus-new-york.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 17, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-03-17T09:49:27.519Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Paralysis is not supposed to be one of the symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus sweeping the world.\nBut drastic action by the world's central banks \u2014\u00a0the \"bazooka\" as German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz\u00a0labelled it, a term quickly adopted by the financial\u00a0media \u2014 has left economic actors stunned and immobilized.\nAs markets continue to\u00a0gyrate and tumble\u00a0there is increasing evidence that even free money, now being offered at nearly zero per cent, is simply not enough to reassure the world facing an inscrutable\u00a0future.\nEvidence of that paralysis came from close to home yesterday.\nWhile the headline from the Canadian Real Estate Association's monthly release boasted of a resurging property market, far more revealing was what the group's economists said about the future.\n\"As providers of the most accurate and timely housing data and statistics, CREA cannot credibly update its quarterly forecast at this time,\" said the association in bold type at the top of its\u00a0data report for February.\nLess than two weeks ago, when Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz announced his\u00a0first big interest rate cut, there were fears the sharp fall in lending costs would goose the Canadian property market with the attendant\u00a0danger of recreating a real estate bubble.\nNow even the experts aren't sure.

Like\u00a0most renters, he brought along the person he'd be living with \u2014\u00a0his boyfriend.\nThey viewed about ten places, and among them, a few of the landlords were startlingly direct: Were the two a couple?\u00a0Mu\u00f1oz was caught off guard at first, unsure of how to respond. But each time he fielded the question, he answered truthfully.\n\"I found that having to be explicit about that was not fair,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. And the question spurred doubt whenever his applications went unanswered. \"I always wondered, 'Is this straight couple getting this apartment that I'm not?' \"\u00a0\nMu\u00f1oz's experience reflects the struggles that LGBT people face when searching for rental housing in Metro Vancouver. They're not only contending with\u00a0the region's sky-high rental prices and near-zero vacancy rates. There's an added worry: whether their sexual orientation or gender identity will hinder their search, and finding spaces where they can feel safe.\n\"At least daily, we have someone either calling or coming into the space, saying, 'Can you help me find a place to live?'\" said Heather Wong-Mitchell, management of finance and administration at Qmunity, an LGBT\u00a0centre in Vancouver's West End neighbourhood.\nStudies suggest LGBT renters' concerns are warranted. A U.S. government housing study in 2013 showed that same-sex couples received fewer responses to email inquiries about rental units than straight couples. A 2016 study found that LGBT people filed housing discrimination complaints as often as women and people of colour, highlighting a need for stronger protections in some states.\nIn B.C., tenants are protected under the province's human rights code, which stipulates that landlords can't refuse to rent to a tenant because of their sexual orientation. If\u00a0renters do encounter discrimination, they can take their case to the B.C.\u00a0Human Rights Tribunal.\nBut LGBT renters say that prejudice\u00a0can appear more subtly, making it harder to pinpoint\u00a0and challenge.\n\"That's the thing about discrimination,\" Mu\u00f1oz said, referring to his unanswered rental applications. \"You never know if that was an actual factor.\"\nIn 2015, Mu\u00f1oz, who now lives in Toronto, decided to circumvent the rental system. He co-launched Homes for Queers, a Facebook group that connects LGBT renters in Vancouver.\nMembers\u00a0apply before gaining page access and must agree to be respectful. The listings are more personal than typical Craigslist ads: renters often note their gender identities, sexual orientations and preferred pronouns.\u00a0\nToday, the\u00a0community boasts about 3,800 members; similar groups have popped up in cities like\u00a0Victoria, B.C., Seattle, Wash.,\u00a0and Portland, Ore.\u00a0Wong-Mitchell, with the Qmunity centre, said the Vancouver page is\u00a0one of the first resources she highlights when approached by prospective renters.\n\"Folks are able to find housing where\u00a0they can be a little bit more confident around their safety and security,\" she said.\nUnease from LGBT renters might seem at odds in Vancouver,\u00a0home of Davie Village, the well-established LGBT enclave in the West End. But the area's desirability\u00a0has\u00a0priced out many people. The average cost of a one-bedroom in the West End is $1,983, and $3,200 for a two-bedroom, according to PadMapper, a rental listings site.\nThose numbers mean LGBT renters must contend with having fewer dollars in the city, or move to the suburbs, where queer communities are smaller and the resources are more sparse.\nChris, a 34-year-old sales associate who identifies as trans, says he's never lived in central Vancouver, out of financial necessity. (He asked not to disclose his last name because he isn't fully out at work). In 2018, he moved from Vancouver to Port Moody, B.C., for the cheaper housing.\n\"It would be great if I could afford the West End or any places where there's a queer community,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's ever seriously crossed my mind. It's not in my budget.\"\nBut his current living situation, he said, is the best he's had in his five years in B.C.: a six-bedroom, two-bathroom house, which he shares with five roommates.\nThey live communally, which means they share all the household expenses and\u00a0hold meetings every second week. It's a housing model that's popular in the LGBT community, as roommates usually screen each other to ensure their values align.\n\"It doesn't mean that you hang out 24-7,\" Chris said. \"It means that you have the support of a community when you need it and you're also able to give that support. That's something that's very important to me.\"\u00a0\nLaws in B.C. protect tenants from discriminatory landlords, but not roommates in shared accommodation. Robert Patterson, a legal advocate with B.C.'s Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre, said the exception is meant to allow someone to choose a roommate of a certain gender, for instance, or someone from their country of origin.\nBut it also means that a roommate could deny someone over their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\"It's a glaring lack of protection for LGBT people,\" Patterson said.\nThe centre doesn't collect data on LGBT discrimination.\u00a0But the last housing case, based on sexual orientation, to go before the B.C.\u00a0Human Rights Tribunal\u00a0was in 2010.\nA judge ruled in favour\u00a0of the complainants, a gay man and a two-spirited man, who claimed their landlord in West Vancouver\u00a0had used homophobic remarks, forced into his way into their home and physically assaulted one of them. The two men were awarded $15,000.\nMost cases, however, aren't as extreme and don't end up in a tribunal. An LGBT\u00a0renter's strife can simply stem from not feeling comfortable in their own home.\nJustin Lawrence, 31, moved to\u00a0Vancouver in the spring to start working at the international airport. He said he never felt at ease in his previous home in Calgary, which he shared with three roommates. Lawrence was the only gay man.\u00a0\nThere was no overt discrimination, he said, but his roommates' body energy and attitude suggested discomfort.\n\"I know there's still people out there who still don't like our community,\" he said. \"Now, when I go into an interview for a house, one of the things I look at is whether I can connect with a person.\"\nThat's ultimately what he found. In April, Lawrence posted on ad on the Homes for Queers Facebook page and, a month later, moved into a three-storey house in New Westminster\u00a0with three roommates. One of them, Kira, a transgender woman, has become one of his closest friends, he said.\n\"It's been easy. She looks out for me and checks up on me,\" he said.\u00a0\"It's the first time in three-and-a-half years I've been on my own that I can actually call a place home.\"\nAre you an LGBT renter with a housing story to share?

She also noted the expense of connecting to sewage and other services.\nStewart said the city will have to get TransLink on board right away but sees the challenge as \"less of an inconvenience and more of an opportunity\" to look at options like\u00a0connecting\u00a0Senakw\u00a0to the SkyTrain using light rail.\nHe said the city has in the past negotiated\u00a0agreements with the Musqueam First Nation for policing and fire services and can do something similar with the Squamish Nation.\nThe nation also has the power to collect property tax to pay for those services.\nLarry Benge, co-chair of the\u00a0Coalition of Vancouver Neighbourhoods, is concerned about the density and scale of the project and worries it could overwhelm the aesthetic of the \"iconic\"\u00a0Burrard Street Bridge.\n\"It would be good if all parties involved or affected could discuss what's going on,\" said Benge.\nGinger Gosnell-Myers, Vancouver's\u00a0\u00a0first Aboriginal relations manager, said\u00a0she finds it almost funny that people are asking to be consulted about a small sliver of land on traditional Squamish territory.\n\"This city is essentially built on stolen Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh land,\" said\u00a0\u00a0Gosnell-Myers\u00a0Wednesday on\u00a0The Early Edition.\u00a0\"This is a game changer for this city.

The situation is unprecedented, and records will no doubt be broken.\u00a0\nWhen faced with these daunting figures, though, the most important aspect is how long the situation lasts.\nLooking at the past year, the\u00a0national economy and job market were relatively\u00a0healthy. In February, the country's unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent, and\u00a0245,000 jobs had been created in the previous 12 months.

On March 30, the airline announced layoffs for 16,500 employees, but then on Wednesday, it said it would re-hire all of them.\nWatch:\u00a0'This will be the new normal until a vaccine is developed,' says\u00a0Trudeau:\nAlberta\u00a0is likely going to be the hardest-hit province in the coming months\u00a0because it's hampered not only by the pandemic\u00a0but also by record low oil prices.\nManitoba's premier said Wednesday he expects his province\u00a0will fare better\u00a0economically than Alberta.\nIn Banff, the unemployment rate is believed to be about 85 per cent, a baffling situation considering the mountain resort community typically has \"Help Wanted\"\u00a0signs hanging in the front window of just about every store, hotel and restaurant.\u00a0\nAlberta will easily surpass and possibly double the previous unemployment record, which was 12.4 per cent in 1984.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0unemployment rate might not actually hit Kenney's forecast of 25 per cent \u2014 or the province might far exceed it.\n\"It's\u00a0sadly realistic,\" said Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist with Alberta Central, which oversees the province's credit unions. \"It's the state of the economy at the moment given the sharp drop in economic activity in Alberta, but in Canada in general, too, with all the measures to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"We are seeing everywhere a lot of layoffs in various industries.\"\nSome provincial leaders are beginning to talk about when some measures could be relaxed, allowing some more businesses to open. They are starting to also talk about what the economic recovery plan could look like.\nSt-Arnaud will be watching how many people won't have a job to return to because their businesses can't survive. Those people will remain stuck in the pool of unemployed Canadians until they find a new job.\u00a0\nSimilarly, he says he'll be focusing on whether people can stay afloat financially in a country that ranks among the highest in the world in household debt.\nThose two situations will be more important, he said, than how high the unemployment rate peaks.\nBased on various indicators of indebtedness, St-Arnaud said Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario are the most vulnerable to the economic shock of the pandemic, while P.E.I.,\u00a0Quebec\u00a0and Saskatchewan are the least.\u00a0\nThe situation in B.C. and Ontario, where housing costs have escalated significantly in recent years, is particularly worrisome because many households have no financial buffer.\n\"So, what happens when they lose their jobs? Could we get to a point where you have to sell your assets, i.e. your house, since this is a big part of their wealth?\" St-Arnaud said.\nThere have already been over three\u00a0million employment insurance claims over the past month, and the Conference Board of Canada expects Canada to lose around 2.8\u00a0million jobs in March and April.\n\"The situation is drastic and dramatic.

The Senakw development will be on federal reserve land, meaning the nation does not need permission from the city to forge ahead.\nWith about 10,000 residents expected to occupy those towers, it has some people asking if the neighbourhood is ready for the influx.\n\"I'm thinking of it as a golden opportunity, both in terms of reconciliation and in providing much needed rental housing for the city,\" said Stewart Thursday on CBC's The Early Edition,\u00a0adding that while there are no requirements for the nation to adhere to city policies, it is\u00a0communicating in good faith with the city to make the project as successful and mutually advantageous as possible.\u00a0\nCoun.\u00a0Sarah Kirby-Yung\u00a0shares Stewart's excitement about new rental units\u00a0but told CBC Tuesday she has concerns about the pressures on transit infrastructure in the area.\nOnly about 10 per cent of the units will have parking availability, meaning many residents will likely rely on transit. She also noted the expense of connecting to sewage and other services.\nStewart said the city will have to get TransLink on board right away but sees the challenge as \"less of an inconvenience and more of an opportunity\" to look at options like\u00a0connecting\u00a0Senakw\u00a0to the SkyTrain using light rail.\nHe said the city has in the past negotiated\u00a0agreements with the Musqueam First Nation for policing and fire services and can do something similar with the Squamish Nation.\nThe nation also has the power to collect property tax to pay for those services.\nLarry Benge, co-chair of the\u00a0Coalition of Vancouver Neighbourhoods, is concerned about the density and scale of the project and worries it could overwhelm the aesthetic of the \"iconic\"\u00a0Burrard Street Bridge.\n\"It would be good if all parties involved or affected could discuss what's going on,\" said Benge.\nGinger Gosnell-Myers, Vancouver's\u00a0\u00a0first Aboriginal relations manager, said\u00a0she finds it almost funny that people are asking to be consulted about a small sliver of land on traditional Squamish territory.\n\"This city is essentially built on stolen Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh land,\" said\u00a0\u00a0Gosnell-Myers\u00a0Wednesday on\u00a0The Early Edition.\u00a0\"This is a game changer for this city.

The situation is unprecedented, and records will no doubt be broken.\u00a0\nWhen faced with these daunting figures, though, the most important aspect is how long the situation lasts.\nLooking at the past year, the\u00a0national economy and job market were relatively\u00a0healthy. In February, the country's unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent, and\u00a0245,000 jobs had been created in the previous 12 months.

On March 30, the airline announced layoffs for 16,500 employees, but then on Wednesday, it said it would re-hire all of them.\nWatch:\u00a0'This will be the new normal until a vaccine is developed,' says\u00a0Trudeau:\nAlberta\u00a0is likely going to be the hardest-hit province in the coming months\u00a0because it's hampered not only by the pandemic\u00a0but also by record low oil prices.\nManitoba's premier said Wednesday he expects his province\u00a0will fare better\u00a0economically than Alberta.\nIn Banff, the unemployment rate is believed to be about 85 per cent, a baffling situation considering the mountain resort community typically has \"Help Wanted\"\u00a0signs hanging in the front window of just about every store, hotel and restaurant.\u00a0\nAlberta will easily surpass and possibly double the previous unemployment record, which was 12.4 per cent in 1984.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0unemployment rate might not actually hit Kenney's forecast of 25 per cent \u2014 or the province might far exceed it.\n\"It's\u00a0sadly realistic,\" said Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist with Alberta Central, which oversees the province's credit unions. \"It's the state of the economy at the moment given the sharp drop in economic activity in Alberta, but in Canada in general, too, with all the measures to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"We are seeing everywhere a lot of layoffs in various industries.\"\nSome provincial leaders are beginning to talk about when some measures could be relaxed, allowing some more businesses to open. They are starting to also talk about what the economic recovery plan could look like.\nSt-Arnaud will be watching how many people won't have a job to return to because their businesses can't survive. Those people will remain stuck in the pool of unemployed Canadians until they find a new job.\u00a0\nSimilarly, he says he'll be focusing on whether people can stay afloat financially in a country that ranks among the highest in the world in household debt.\nThose two situations will be more important, he said, than how high the unemployment rate peaks.\nBased on various indicators of indebtedness, St-Arnaud said Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario are the most vulnerable to the economic shock of the pandemic, while P.E.I.,\u00a0Quebec\u00a0and Saskatchewan are the least.\u00a0\nThe situation in B.C. and Ontario, where housing costs have escalated significantly in recent years, is particularly worrisome because many households have no financial buffer.\n\"So, what happens when they lose their jobs? Could we get to a point where you have to sell your assets, i.e. your house, since this is a big part of their wealth?\" St-Arnaud said.\nThere have already been over three\u00a0million employment insurance claims over the past month, and the Conference Board of Canada expects Canada to lose around 2.8\u00a0million jobs in March and April.\n\"The situation is drastic and dramatic.

Montrealers had to turn to emergency housing, staying in schools and at the downtown YMCA because they had nowhere to go.\nBenzouine said this year, Project Genesis has seen an increase in the number of people coming to them for help finding a place to live.\n\"Something is really going on,\" he said.\nHe said the agency's outreach workers report that\u00a0it's common to see families of four, five or six people living in one- or two-bedroom apartments.

And it could increase the cost of shipping, he added, if barges can't carry as much cargo or have to be cancelled. It's also an issue for the Coast Guard.\u00a0\n\"If [the] Coast Guard can't get in and out of the port here, maybe they're just going to pack up and move up to Yellowknife,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We can't always be so reactive, sometimes we have to address a problem before it becomes a problem.

The estimated price tag for restoring the harbour is between $8 to $10 million.\u00a0\n\"The federal government clearly does not want to talk about dredging,\" Schumann said. \"No one seems to want to look after it.\"\nR.J.

Simpson said the territorial and federal governments need to work together on a plan and take action to get the job done.\u00a0\n\"That's the problem is we've always got a lot of plans, we've got strategies, we have all that but we never seem to action anything and I'm big on doing things and getting things done.\"\u00a0\nThe issue of housing in Hay River came to a flashpoint in March when a fire broke out at the beleaguered Mackenzie Place apartment complex. That displaced about 150 people, some of whom were living in public housing units.\u00a0\nSchumann said the territory has \"thrown a lot of money\" at the issue to address short-term needs and is now looking at long-term solutions.\u00a0\nThe town's population is also projected to almost double over the next five years, according to the Town of Hay River's new community plan. That's based in part on\u00a0anticipated job growth from a\u00a0number of planned projects including a fish plant, a long-term care facility and a wood pellet plant in the nearby community of Enterprise.\nThe N.W.T. Housing Corporation has also committed to building 12 units for RCMP members in Hay River.\u00a0\nThe town is already working on re-zoning land to create more residential areas. But it's going to\u00a0need\u00a0money for development like putting in sewer and water lines and paving roads.\u00a0\nR.J. Simpson said the territorial government\u00a0could help by providing a loan which would \"essentially be self-financing\" as the territory gets transfer payments from Ottawa for every person that moves to the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\n\"The GNWT has been resistant to budge on the town's borrowing limit and hasn't wanted to help the town or help themselves really,\" he said. \"That's something that desperately needs to be addressed in the next Assembly.\"\nSchumann noted the territorial government isn't responsible for all housing in the N.W.T. but agreed the 19th Assembly will have to work closely with federal and municipal governments on the issue.\u00a0\n\"The housing minister has his challenges, whoever that's going to be going forward.\u00a0That's a challenge no matter which government you're in.\"\u00a0\nRocky Simpson also stressed the need for the territory to work with the Town of Hay River and its residents.\n\"I think it's important that whoever's elected actually works with the mayor and council and provides them the support they need to work with the [territorial government] to ensure that the paperwork's in place and the land becomes available as soon as possible.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jamie-Lee McKenzie", "title": "Tiny houses could be making their way to Greater Sudbury", "description": "Tiny houses are 400 square feet or smaller", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-tiny-houses-report-1.5271880", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3209609.1441027330!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yellowknife-tiny-house.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 06, 2019 6:00 AM ET", "2019-09-06T10:00:00.337Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sudbury City Councillors Deb McIntosh and Geoff McCausland want to know more about small and tiny houses.\nThe councillors are bringing a motion to Tuesday's city council meeting that will ask staff to evaluate options for encouraging the development of small and tiny houses, saying they'd like to see best practices and\u00a0a working group created to look into these houses.\u00a0\nTiny houses have been growing in popularity in the last few years, there's more than a few TV shows and books about finding the perfect tiny house. And many young people are choosing to go the minimalist lifestyle with these smaller dwellings.\n\"As you see prices go up in the city and houses are becoming unattainable to certain groups of people as well, it's not just about affordable, it's about attainable as well \u2014 affordable to some people has a different definition,\" McIntosh said.\n\"Being able to have a home at the age of 20, or perhaps there are a lot of people who just don't want all the square footage, they do want to live a more simpler life and they do want a smaller home...\u00a0so I think there is a market here in Greater Sudbury for this sort of thing,\" she said.\nMcIntosh also says tiny houses could be a good solution to help with the city's\u00a0Housing and Homelessness Plan.\n\"The people who are living on the streets who need a place to sleep, there's the shelter and then we want to move from the shelter to another accommodation so you can move to a rental accommodation,\" she said.\u00a0\"Perhaps at some point you can move onto a smaller home toward home ownership yourself, so it's part of a continuum of providing homes.\"\nHouses are considered tiny when they are smaller than 400 square feet and while many of these houses come on wheels, they can also be built on a foundation, often for a fraction of the cost of a regular house.\nHowever, many municipalities in Ontario and across the country don't allow for tiny houses to be considered permanent homes. Municipalities have\u00a0bylaws about housing and what is considered a house, such as they\u00a0cannot be on wheels and that houses need to be a certain square footage.\u00a0\n\"The policies of the past few decades were focused on a bigger and more spread out footprint and we're starting to see a reversal in the trends and we need to create the tools necessary for developers to be able to build smaller homes in the shifting market that's happening,\" McCausland said.\u00a0\nIf the motion is passed, city staff will bring a report back to council in 2020. McCausland is hoping that it will\u00a0lead to more housing opportunities.\n\"It's one step in a process, so it'll allow staff to go and look at what's necessary to make smaller and tiny homes a reality in Greater Sudbury,\" he said. \"What I hope it leads to is developments that are more walkable, more focused on community and less focused on cars.\"\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Battle lines drawn over Ottawa's suburban sprawl", "description": "Debate begins over whether to expand urban boundary or hold the line", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-urban-boundary-debate-city-development-1.5488351", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5497216.1584126069!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/urban-boundary.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 23, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-04-23T08:00:00.029Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Andy Lee likes the smell of a new house.\nThat clean, \"just built\" whiff still lingers inside the grey brick home he and his parents moved into last summer on\u00a0the very edge of suburban\u00a0Ottawa.\n\"I heard LRT is coming in a few years, so if I get a job downtown, it's more convenient for me. That's why I chose this location,\" Lee explained.\nLee recently left his job and moved to Ottawa from Toronto, where he didn't see a future for himself \u2014 not with the steep rents. He's not alone.\nAccording to the city's own middle-of-the-road estimate, Ottawa's population will grow by 400,000, through migration and births, to 1.4 million by 2046. That will create a need for 200,000 new homes.\u00a0\nBut where will they all go?\nThere's an invisible line encircling Ottawa called the urban boundary. It effectively divides town from country, and builders can only build new neighbourhoods inside the line.\nEvery once in a while, the line is moved. Council tried to\u00a0tweak\u00a0it back in\u00a02009 by adding 230 hectares, but\u00a0after\u00a0builders appealed,\u00a0the city was forced to\u00a0add another 1,100\u00a0hectares for development.\nGiven the projected population growth, city staff are now contemplating\u00a0whether the city should again let out its belt, and by how much. Their recommendations are expected to be made public Friday, and the\u00a0debate will start in earnest\u00a0at a virtual meeting of the committees responsible for city planning on May 11.\nThe Ontario government requires that the city maintain a\u00a0prescribed stock of developable land. The difference this time is that city council gets the final say. There can be no appeals by builders or community groups.\nPeople who follow city business\u00a0know this is a big deal, and some are gearing up for a fight.\nEcology Ottawa has\u00a0collected more than 3,000 signatures on a petition\u00a0calling on the city to \"hold the line\" and leave\u00a0the urban boundary unchanged.\u00a0\n\"We think it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to halt urban sprawl,\" said Emilie Gr\u00e9nier, who leads the\u00a0environmental group's campaigns to\u00a0fight\u00a0climate change. \"What the councillors\u00a0will decide ... will really have an implication for many years to come.\"\nEcology Ottawa, the Greenspace Alliance, the Federation of Citizens' Associations and other groups\u00a0held\u00a0workshops before the pandemic began, showing how the city can add all those new homes and apartments within Ottawa's existing urban footprint.\nThey've arranged a virtual rally May 8, and the city promises to give them a\u00a0way to take part in the\u00a0May 11 online meeting.\nThe groups argue the city\u00a0will only live up to its promises to tackle climate change and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions if people live in denser\u00a0neighbourhoods where everything they need is within a 15-minute walk.\nBut the organization that represents most home builders says holding the line on the urban boundary would only cause further environmental harm\u00a0because many people will still want their dream\u00a0home at the right price, and will go farther to get it, even if that means crossing the line altogether.\n\"If you limit people's housing choices within the City of Ottawa, you're only going to push them outside.\u00a0So you push them to Rockland, to Kemptville, out to Arnprior, and that's the real damage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that's real sprawl there,\" said\u00a0Jason Burggraaf of the Greater Ottawa Home Builders' Association.\nCarleton Place, Ont., for instance, is growing quickly.\nThe town, about eight kilometres past Ottawa's western boundary, currently contains some 4,670 dwellings,\u00a0380 new units added in\u00a02018 alone\u00a0\u2014 a giant leap from the 60-75 added in previous years.\nDevelopers\u00a0don't think accommodating 400,000 people within the current urban boundary\u00a0is even feasible.\n\"If we jam\u00a0them all into existing neighbourhoods, we're talking major towers in every ward across the city,\" Burggraaf said. \"Not everyone wants to live in those\u00a0apartments.\"\nThe city now faces difficult choices if it expands, according to Rideau-Goulbourn Coun. Scott Moffatt, who\u00a0represents both rural residents and suburbanites in Barrhaven.\nTo witness that great divide between town and country, look no further than Hope Side Road, where stacked townhouses in Kanata's Bridlewood\u00a0neighbourhood stare across at tidy rows of corn in a farmer's\u00a0field.\n\"I would never fail more as a councillor than if I let that become housing,\" Moffat said\u00a0pointing at the field, which he claims to be\u00a0some of the best remaining farmland in Ottawa.\nThe suburbs are quickly encroaching on Ottawa's agricultural land, wetlands\u00a0and\u00a0rural villages. Moffatt knows the city needs to expand, but not without careful planning, and not onto such\u00a0sensitive land.\nIn his mind, there's no question city council will have to lay the groundwork for\u00a0a future city that packs far more people per hectare than it does today.\nThe city will need to allow higher towers along the LRT, more 12-unit apartments and more units on smaller lots, not just in neighbourhoods like Westboro or at Dow's Lake, but all over Ottawa \u2014 including its outer edges.\n\"Are we ready for that? Are our communities ready for that?\u00a0It's a huge conversation,\" Moffatt said.\n"}, {"author": "Hannah Kost", "title": "Calgarian who was in Tehran when Soleimani was killed says he fears war", "description": "Sadra Semnani was visiting family in Iran when a U.S. airstrike killed Gen.\u00a0Qassem Soleimani", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/iran-canada-tehran-airstrike-general-qassem-soleimani-donald-trump-iraq-1.5417591", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5418275.1578434659!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sadra-semnani.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 07, 2020 5:26 PM MT", "2020-01-08T00:26:51.319Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Iranian Canadian Sadra Semnani\u00a0said he\u00a0was visiting family in Tehran on Friday when the story broke.\n\"When I woke up, I saw the news and I freaked out at first, because I thought, 'OK.\u00a0This is a war,'\"\u00a0Semnani\u00a0told Doug Dirks on\u00a0The Homestretch\u00a0Jan. 6.\nIslamic\u00a0Revolutionary Guard Gen.\u00a0Qassem Soleimani, who was considered a heroic figure in his home country of\u00a0Iran, had been slain\u00a0near\u00a0Baghdad's airport on Jan. 3 \u2014 and\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump ordered\u00a0the airstrike that killed him.\nSadra Semnani, who has been living in Calgary since 2011 with his wife, said\u00a0the targeted killing and its ongoing\u00a0fallout have left him worried for what is next.\u00a0\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran stretch back\u00a0decades\u00a0but have been simmering\u00a0since\u00a0Trump pulled\u00a0out of Iran's atomic accord in 2018 and imposed\u00a0sanctions that crippled Iran's economy.\nThe airstrike that killed\u00a0Soleimani\u00a0followed an acute increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities in Iraq\u00a0since\u00a0pro-Iranian militias attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\nSoleimani designed Iran's policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against ISIS.\nHe's considered responsible for multiple\u00a0attacks on U.S. troops and American allies.\nTrump told media following the airstrike\u00a0that\u00a0Soleimani was planning \"sinister attacks\" on U.S. diplomats and service members.

The Cridge Centre\u00a0has 36 units they can move women into.\nAccording to Stretch, women leaving an abusive partner are normally dependent on income assistance which is less than $700 a month for a woman with two kids and \"there is just absolutely no option in Victoria\" to find safe housing at that price.\n\"Honestly, it is such a challenge to know what to say to people\u00a0who are absolutely desperate and to feel in some ways that you are giving them the option to stay in a situation that is dangerous to them and very dangerous to their kids,\" said Stretch.\u00a0\nAngela Marie MacDougall, executive director of BWSS, which helps\u00a0women in Metro Vancouver, said the organization responds to up to 1,800 calls a year from women with limited housing options, some of whom are considering returning to their abusers.\n\"There isn't housing for women to leave quickly and that's the reality,\" said MacDougall. \"It becomes the reason women stay.\"\nDean said the government understands how urgent the problem is and wants to work with community partners.\n\"We've seen cutbacks under the previous government,\" said Dean.\n\"We've had for such a long time so much neglect on the housing crisis that we are really trying to catch up.\"\nTo hear the complete interview with Mitzi Dean on The Early Edition tap the audio link below:\nTo hear the complete interview with Candace Stretch\u00a0On The Island tap the audio link below:\u00a0\nVictimLinkBC\u00a0is a toll-free, confidential, multilingual telephone service available across B.C. and the Yukon 24 hours a day, seven\u00a0days a week at 1-800-563-0808.\nService is provided in more than 110 languages, including 17 Indigenous\u00a0languages.\nVictimLinkBC is TTY accessible.

This is just outrageous,\" Reynolds said.\nCAPREIT bought the property three and a half years ago and has since made major repairs and upgrades to the complex.\nReynolds and other residents are concerned they will have to shoulder the cost of the renovations, to the tune of hundreds of dollars over the next three years.\nIn Ontario, the provincial government sets guidelines for how much a landlord can raise the rent each year. The limit for 2019 is a 1.8 per cent increase, while the limit for 2020 has been set at 2.2 per cent.\nLandlords that want to increase the rent further to cover capital improvement costs can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) for an additional increase, with a maximum of 3 per cent on top of the provincial guideline for up to three years.\nThat means the residents at 366-368 Oxford St. W. could see an increase as big as 4.8 per cent in 2019 and 5.2 per cent in 2020.\nThey would also owe any additional rent since November 2018, which is the date of the first rent increase CAPREIT requested in its initial application to the LTB last July. According to the LTB, tenants do not have to pay the difference until an adjudicator makes a ruling on the landlord's application.\n\"I live on a pension,\" said Cindy Bailey, who has lived in the building for more than two years. \"It would affect me so much, that I don't even know if I could live here.\"\nReynolds echoed\u00a0those concerns, adding that finding another place to live would be next to impossible in London, where there is a lack of affordable housing.\n\"There's no place to go for renters in London. Rents are sky high all over the city, we have no choice and CAPREIT knows this,\" he said.\nTrish MacPherson, executive vice president of operations for CAPREIT, said the company knew extensive work needed to be done when it bought the property in January 2016.\n\"Major maintenance had not been done in many years,\" MacPherson stated in an email to CBC London.\n\"We have invested over $700,000 in new roofs, boilers, elevators, energy efficient lighting and paving since our purchase.\"\nCAPREIT applied to increase the rent above the provincial guidelines, she said, to cover the cost of these investments, which were needed \"to maintain the building safety and quality.\"\nBut the tenants argue the cost of the renovations would have been reflected in the price CAPREIT paid for the property, given the age and condition of the buildings.\nThe tenants also say that some of the work could have been done over a longer period of time, instead of all at once.\u00a0\n\"They buy older properties cheap, they know they have these extra expenses obviously because they're buying them cheap and they're old, but then they expect the tenants to pay for these expenses,\" Bailey said.\nBailey and Reynolds were among a group of tenants who appeared at a LTB hearing in London on Friday to plead their case.\nA written decision will be issued by an adjudicator, which will determine how much CAPREIT can increase the rent based on the negotiations during the hearing.\nReynolds said although the final increase may end up being less than anticipated, it will still have a negative impact on many tenants. He worries some people will end up homeless as a result.\n\"My position is that housing is a human right and a human need, and it shouldn't be commodified like this by very large powerful wealthy corporations like CAPREIT,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681718948", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Lien Yeung", "title": "Where to buy in a cooling housing market?

real estate markets across\u00a0Greater Vancouver by financial publication MoneySense\u00a0puts the neighbourhood of Uptown in New Westminster, B.C., at the top of its rankings.\nAverage prices for a detached home aren't as high as\u00a0areas nearby, says writer and analyst\u00a0Romana King.\n\"There's been a lot of development to [New Westminsters's] downtown core\u00a0\u2014 it's mostly condos and townhomes, but what that does is that increases the value of the single family homes in that community,\" explains\u00a0King.\nIn addition to prices, the analysis took into consideration factors such appreciation relative to neighbouring communities, long-term potential and reviews from real estate agents.\nUptown is bordered by Eighth Avenue to Royal Avenue and Fifth to Eighth streets.\nThe area is home to a\u00a0large mall, the city's main library and many restaurants that line the streets.\nThose amenities have transformed New Westminster from a sleepy \"bedroom community\" to\u00a0a place where residents can live, work and play, she says.\nComing in second on the list is\u00a0the\u00a0Lynnmour area\u00a0in North Vancouver and number three was Sea Island, adjacent to the Vancouver International Airport, in Richmond\u00a0\nVancouver has been bumped far down the list because prices have already risen so much that\u00a0it's out of reach for many.\nDeveloper Perdip Moore has primarily built homes in Vancouver, but after working with the City of New Westminster\u00a0 to build a\u00a0laneway home, he's keen\u00a0to build more in the region.\n\"They've been actively involved even through the construction process\u00a0and fine tuning their guidelines\u00a0\u00a0... so it's been really nice working with them,\" he says.\nLower lot prices, limited red tape and an open door policy with city hall have led to faster construction, he says, which has\u00a0translated into approximately $50 per square foot in savings for buyers.\nBuilding a new home in New Westminster\u00a0runs about $225 dollars a square foot, whereas it's closer to $300 in Vancouver.\n\"That adds up real quickly,\" he says.\nThose who call the area home say they already knew their community was a gem.\u00a0\n\"In a way, I don't want to say that because I don't want hordes of people moving here,\" laughed Maria Andoff, an Uptown homeowner of 30 years.\nWhile she knows\u00a0other communities are pricier, she still wouldn't call the neighbourhood affordable\nHouses still hover around $800,000 to $900,000, she said.\n\"Like that's a lot,\" she says.\nIf you can afford it though, she says it's a neighbourhood waiting to be discovered.\n"}, {"author": "Andrew Kurjata", "title": "You aren't allowed to live in your RV year round, regional district warns", "description": "'People

News", "content": "RVs are not houses\u00a0and old campers are not cabins.\nThat's the message from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District, which is cracking down on the use of recreational vehicles as permanent dwellings in B.C.'s Interior.\nRegina Sadilkova, the director of development services for the district, said people living in recreational vehicles are\u00a0an\u00a0ongoing problem, but one that seems to be growing.\n\"There's always more and more used recreational vehicles that may not be roadworthy for sale for less and less money. so they buy them, they park them,\" she told CBC\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0guest host Rob Polson.\n\"Then they start building onto them: Decks, porches, roofs.\"\nSadilkova\u00a0said aside from being unsightly, the souped-up dwellings fail to comply with the standards required for permanent homes, such as having a proper sewer or septic hookup.\u00a0\nShe also said many of the vehicles are parked along lakes or rivers, which poses environmental concerns.\nFinally, she said that unlike a new\u00a0out-building or home expansion, RVs\u00a0and trailers do not add to property values, so the regional district is missing out on revenue it needs to operate.\nNot everyone agrees with the regional district's message.\nMerlin Blackwell, the mayor of neighbouring Clearwater, said most people in his community are supportive of allowing people to live in RVs and trailers year-round.\n\"We have a housing crisis in this province,\" he said. \"There really isn't a lot of housing.\"\nBlackwell said he's interested in exploring all options for adding housing stock, and the community already has a \"tiny home district\" zoned for homes on lots as small as 400 square feet, and that both Clearwater and the regional district are undertaking a housing needs review.\nAcross the country, local governments have been grappling with how to handle people moving into recreational vehicles on a permanent basis.\nA Calgary man managed to pay off $85,000 in debt by moving into a trailer and parking outside big box stores or industrial areas around the city.\nIn Saskatchewan, the Rural Municipality of Mervin changed its zoning bylaw so that landowners living in trailers or campers have to apply for a $200 permit to stay on some lakeside properties.\nAnd in B.C., the rise of RV dwellers has been documented as a response to growing real estate\u00a0prices in the Lower Mainland.\nBut that rise has come with an increase in the number of garbage, rats and other problems, according to residents of neighbourhoods where RVs congregate.\u00a0\nSadilkova said\u00a0the regional district would work with social agencies to find placements for people who are genuinely unable to afford a place to live in the Thomson-Nicola region.\nBut, she said, most of the people she's found violating the rules do have the means to live elsewhere\u00a0and are simply choosing not to.\nShe warned that people living in recreational vehicles are subject to tickets of up to $250, and that repeat offenders could be taken to court.\nSadilkova also said that, while in the past the regional district has only responded to complaints about people living in RVs and trailers, its elected board of directors have now directed staff to be more proactive in enforcing regulations as\u00a0 illegal dwellings grow in number \u2014 and in size.\n\"People are doing things like installing wood-burning stoves,\" she said. \"They're really moving in.\"\nBlackwell said he sympathized with the regional district, and neighbours concerned at having year-round RVs in areas that aren't equipped to handle them.\n\"We really need to find a different solution other than having people living year-round in RVs, because it isn't a great way to live.\"\nInterviews produced for\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0by Jenifer Norwell.\nSubscribe to\u00a0Daybreak Kamloops\u00a0on CBC Listen, and connect with CBC Kamloops\u00a0on Facebook, Twitter and

community and the province as a whole.\"\nAs of this week, 10 of the lots have been sold and the remaining six have deals pending. With one lot recently cleared for construction, Stannix figures there will be 16 new homes standing on the community's east side within the next three years.\n\"I think the approach that we took is going to work out for us,\" Stannix said, taking a break from decorating the town's historic train station for an annual Christmas event.\nIn all, more than 600 people applied to buy one of the dirt-cheap lots after they went on the market amid much fanfare in November 2018.\nStannix said the idea for selling lots for less than the price of a cup of coffee was first raised at a meeting in 2012, when it was apparent the village was in decline.\nLike many other communities on the East Coast, McAdam couldn't compete with the lure of high-paying jobs in Alberta's oilpatch.\n\"We were bleeding population to the West,\" Stannix said.\nAt the time, Stannix had recently moved back to his hometown with his wife Kate after he retired from a 32-year career in the Canadian military. Soon after he was elected mayor in 2016, the dollar-lot idea started to gain traction.\nThe village council also moved ahead with an aggressive plan to tear down derelict homes and buildings to improve property values.\nOf the 25 rundown properties identified, 17 have been flattened.\n\"As soon as we tore the old houses down, people were buying the ones next to them,\" said Stannix, adding that 75 homes have been sold in past three years alone.\nDuring that time, the village's population has grown by 100 to 1,250, and the new dollar-lot homes will continue that trend.\nAs for those moving in, Stannix said they are an eclectic bunch.\n\"We have retirees. We have young people. We have families. We have new Canadians \u2014\u00a0couples from India and Jamaica,\" he said, adding that several of them are from Ontario and Quebec.\nOne of the conditions of sale is a two-year deadline for building a house that is at least 1,200 square feet.\nDevelopers tried to snatch up all 16 properties, but Stannix told them the village, about 70 kilometres southwest of Fredericton, wasn't interested.\n\"We wanted people to come in and\u00a0put their personal stamp on the house that they wanted to build,\" he said. \"And we wanted to make sure they understood what the lifestyle is like in McAdam.\"\nThe mayor said prospective buyers were told to expect a laid-back atmosphere, where snowmobiling, hunting, fishing and nature walks are the main ways to unwind.\n\"In McAdam, rush-hour traffic is three people coming to an intersection and saying, 'No, you go first.\"'\nMeanwhile, officials from another town have already asked the mayor if he can help them duplicate the dollar-lot sales scheme.\nAs well, Stannix has his eye on potential properties along an undeveloped street in town that could soon be sold off for far less than they are actually worth.\n"}, {"author": "David Common & Perlita Stroh", "title": "Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians", "description": "Cost of living is a big federal election issue, even in places where daily expenses are lower than average", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-living-federal-election-richelieu-1.5280573", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281699.1568325203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anais.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 15, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-15T08:00:00.050Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu lies on the banks of a picturesque river about half an hour's drive from Montreal, its main street a collection of charming cafes and historic storefronts. There are many lists of Canada's most affordable cities based on different criteria, and Saint-Jean ends up on nearly every one \u2014\u00a0but even so, people are feeling the pinch.\nThat's because the cost of living in this \"affordable\" city of nearly 100,000 is still only 3 per cent below the national average, according to figures compiled by global relocation firm Salary Expert.\n\"Anxiety about the cost of living consistently polls as one of the top issues in this campaign,\" says CBC political analyst Eric Grenier. \"Canadians report concern over the cost of groceries and fuel in particular.\"\nHousehold expenses for the average Canadian have been climbing, from food and fuel to house prices and rent. For every dollar Canadians earn they owe an average of $1.77, and that debt continues to grow. All of which is making cost of living a big issue heading into the federal election, according to a CBC-commissioned poll.\nThat's the case even in this Quebec community, where residents typically face less financial pressure than many of their fellow Canadians.\nOn the surface, much about Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is\u00a0unremarkable. The median age is 42, compared to Canada's 41. Individual income averages $34,058, about $150 less than the rest of the country.\nUltimately, though, it comes down not just to how much you make but how much you spend, and this community has a small edge.\n\"We have low housing prices,\" says city councillor Maryline Charbonneau. \"A high quality of life that is still affordable.\"\nThe average home purchase price in the community is $315,000 compared to the Canadian average of $480,000.\nHigh employment rates help to make the home-price-to-household-income ratio 4.24, half of what it is in many other major centres. That makes home ownership an option earlier in life, plus paying off the mortgage possible much sooner, allowing residents to allocate more of their income to other expenses or savings.\nIt's an economic advantage many residents are well aware of. Anais Buro has lived in many places and the most recent of her 22 moves was to this community, and when asked if she'll ever move again her reply is a very direct: \"Hopefully not!\"\nOther costs are low, too. Saint-Jean borders vast farmland that supplies inexpensive fresh produce four months of the year.\nPlus, child care is not a crushing expense, due to large provincial subsidies. At most, people like Buro would pay $21.95 a day per child, though it can be as low as $8.05. In other provinces, daycare rates are at least double, if spots are even available.\n\"I think it's really sad to think that families have to worry so much,\" says Buro of places where daycare is more expensive and harder to find. \"We've heard of families [in other provinces] who waited till the first child was in school before they had a second. That's something we don't even think about here.\"\nThe majority of those who live in the French-speaking community also work here, making the commute not only easy, but coming home for lunch a routine.\nFor those who don't work locally, the city has a busy and sleek bus terminal, with 40-minute dedicated-lane service to downtown Montreal. Regular commuters pay as little as $8 roundtrip. A comparable ride on neighbouring southern Ontario's GO Transit runs $18.\nAnd since residents live outside a major city but far enough to not be considered a suburb, car insurance rates are lower than in many comparable communities.\u00a0\nOf course, even Saint-Jean is not a utopia.\n\"Public transport is not that accessible, especially for people not going downtown,\" says Buro. \"So we have to have two cars just to get around. Once we've paid for that it feels like there's not much left.\"\nCouncillor Charbonneau commutes daily to Montreal, but admits she'd like to see government invest more in transit and \"put more money into other forms of active transportation\" to allow residents to move easily without using their cars through the city.\nQuebec continues to offer generous rebates on the purchases of new electric vehicles, but for those who still can't afford one, gas prices are among the nation's highest \u2014\u00a0often 12 cents more than next door in Ontario.\nAnd all the services and incentives need to be paid for, which explains why Quebecers have shouldered the highest total tax burden in the country since 1982. Taxes are, by far, the single largest expenditure of any family.\nAn individual living in Quebec earning $50,000 would pay $10,380 in combined federal and provincial tax, according to a tax calculator developed by Thomson Reuters. In Ontario, the burden would be $8,660 or the Yukon, $8,309.\n\"We feel like we're being taxed like we're in the higher levels, although we are considered middle class,\" Buro adds.\nAll of which leaves Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu just slightly ahead of most other Canadian communities when it comes to cost of living. And that has residents paying attention to what the federal parties vying to lead the country in the upcoming election plan to do in terms of reducing the overhead.\nAnd if those in one of Canada's most affordable cities are feeling the financial squeeze, imagine other parts of the country, particularly the Greater Toronto Area and B.C.'s Lower Mainland where living costs in nearly all categories have been on the rise for years, even as income has failed to keep pace.\nHousing prices increased 44 per cent nationally between 2013 and 2018, for example.\nProperty taxes have also shifted northwards as provinces from coast to coast have downloaded responsibilities (and the costs that go with them) to towns and municipalities.\nWith various polls pointing to the rising cost of living as a primary concern of voters heading into the next election, the parties have taken note, says Eric Grenier.\n\"The Conservatives have made it the centrepiece of their campaign, while the New Democrats are also trying to capitalize on that anxiety and concerns about income inequality.\"\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, are pointing to housing policy changes, including a program to provide first-time buyers with 5 per cent towards the purchase of a home.\nMany across the country, even in \"most affordable\" Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, indicate they'll be looking for a candidate, party or leader who can help improve their financial situation. In CBC's poll, for example, one-third of Canadians surveyed said it was their No. 1 concern.\n\"Family issues are most important to me for the election,\" a Saint-Jean resident told CBC News while out with her family at an annual end-of-summer fair.\nMeanwhile, some in Saint-Jean say they would settle for a government that has a plan to at least slow the rising costs of daily life.\n\"Anybody who's going to help us maintain this quality of life is definitely going to have our vote,\" says Buro.\nAnd with that, she returns to her backyard chickens, collecting the eggs they produce for her daily. Sometimes it's the less tangible benefits that make a place desirable.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/743566915581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2681758523", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Chris Windeyer", "title": "Party leaders weigh in on the year in Yukon politics", "description": "Environmental and pocketbook issues took centre stage in Yukon's Legislative Assembly this year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/2019-year-in-yukon-politics-1.5411184", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3810484.1476817674!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yukon-legislative-assembly.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 31, 2019 8:00 AM CT", "2019-12-31T14:00:00.320Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From the signing of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan to an attempt at electoral reform that went nowhere, it was another interesting year in Yukon politics.\nHere's what the three party leaders had to say about the year's big political stories, and what issues figure to dominate in 2020.\nOn the cost of living: \"I think for me, kind of the biggest trend we might call it for this year is the increasing cost of living for people in the territory. We've seen the carbon tax come into play in July. Obviously that\u00a0caused the price of everything to go up: fuel, groceries, diapers, whatever you want to\u00a0look at. We've seen housing costs higher than they've ever been before. Lot prices [are] completely unaffordable.\"\nOn government transparency: \"We ask questions on behalf of Yukoners\u00a0in the Legislature and we're not getting answers that Yukoners deserve. Anything we ask regarding details, whether it's\u00a0dollar figures or timelines, they [the Liberals] don't answer the questions and they seem to forget that this is taxpayers' dollars that they're spending and they really need to be accountable\u00a0about how they're spending them.\"\nOn electoral reform: \"We did try to work with the government. We worked with the NDP, but unfortunately the Liberals' go-it-alone approach certainly has backfired on them.\u00a0Premier [Sandy Silver] has said that nothing can happen now until spring. That's unfortunate. We offered directly to the premier the option of having a special sitting\u00a0to bring this issue forward. This wasn't a priority for myself and the Yukon Party, we just honestly were trying to work with the government ... on this and it's unfortunate that they've been rather\u00a0pigheaded about moving forward.\"\nOn the Peel Watershed: \"Looking back at the whole year, it has to be finalizing of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use plant that was 15 years in the making. It's\u00a0very significant in that it's a new era of government-to-government relationships ... Being on the banks of the river in Mayo, celebrating with all of Yukon, signing that document \u2014\u00a0that was a profound moment in my life.\"\nOn electoral reform: \"Something that I'd like to redo would be the electoral reform commission and the stalling there. From the beginning, you know we were really in earnest wanting to work with the opposition on the draft terms of reference on the process. At every turn it seemed to be stalled, let's just say that. From the beginning, our platform committee was a nonpartisan commission. So again we're gonna have to rethink things and come back.\"\u00a0\nOn the government's agenda in 2020: \"We talked about the banning of single-use bags. We talked about the banning of conversion therapy. We're working on electrification of the Alaska Highway.... We're introducing an energy retrofit loan program that we talked about a lot this session. We're also introducing leave provisions for those who have experienced domestic violence and\u00a0expanding\u00a0the early kindergarten program.... But I would say that I'm really excited about Yukon University. That's massive. That's a big deal\u00a0for the nation.\"\nOn climate change: \"I think climate crawled its way to the top of the pile this year because we've hit this critical mass \u2014 not only like, nationally or internationally, but locally. So I mean, I think I saw the biggest numbers for sure in any kind of rally that I'd ever seen with the climate strikes this fall.... It's great that [the Liberals] accepted the amendment that I made to their motion to declare a climate emergency. I guess part of the problem is\u00a0that they say they've got a 'climate lens' which they're using to make decisions, but they can't share that climate lens.\"\nOn the government's vision: \"I think what we see is,\u00a0a bit of it almost feels like\u00a0governing by survey:\u00a0'What is a hot topic issue right now?\u00a0What are people saying about it? Can the government make decisions that won't offend people?' If they offend people, it\u00a0goes back to survey or goes back to consultation. I don't necessarily see things that have been just government-driven. I've seen lots of things community-driven that government has picked up on, but very few that are government-driven.\"\nOn issues for 2020: \"We need to talk about housing and housing affordability and accessibility. It's one thing to say that we've got\u00a0more than 200 people on the Yukon Housing wait list. But what about people who aren't on that wait list? What about people who are paying substantially more than 30 per cent of their net income [for housing]? We're going to continue to talk about climate change. What are the actions that follow up with that?\u00a0Minimum wage,\u00a0pharmacare, [and] the\u00a0availability of dental services.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh commits to have more than 300 candidates by next week", "description": "Singh says party would also work with province to address high power rates in N.L.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jagmeet-singh-visiting-st-johns-1.5268350", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268935.1567535013!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/singh-in-st-john-s.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 03, 2019 9:04 AM NT", "2019-09-03T19:46:40.305Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "While the New Democratic Party has\u00a0few federal candidates in place at the moment, party leader\u00a0Jagmeet Singh says he will have more than 300 candidates committed to running for the party by mid-September.\nThe NDP\u00a0leader was in St. John's on Tuesday, supporting candidate and former MP Jack Harris and promoting the party's New Deal for People, aimed at lowering the cost of living.\nSingh said more candidates are coming soon.\u00a0\n\"We've got about half the candidates, and by the end of next week we'll have 302, so we'll be about 90 per cent of the way,\" he said.\n\"We're absolutely confident that come election time that we'll have all candidates in 338 ridings so people can surely vote NDP wherever they live.\"\nSingh said the party has taken more time in its recruiting to do things differently, like having more diverse candidates across the country in advance of the election expected Oct. 21.\u00a0\n\"We haven't seen a lot of representation in the House of Commons that reflects our country, and one of the biggest gaps has been women,\" he said.\n\"We can't change that by just hoping it'll change on its own;\u00a0it takes some effort, and I've made this a really big priority for me as leader.\"\nThat's taken more time to get candidates in place, but Singh said while the other parties appoint candidates, the NDP follow a\u00a0democratic process.\nThe NDP leader said more than\u00a0half the party's candidates are women\u00a0and\u00a0nearly 10 per cent are Indigenous.\nAlthough the party has just two of seven candidates in place in Newfoundland and Labrador, Singh\u00a0said he's \"absolutely confident\" the party will have a full slate of candidates in the province.\nJagmeet Singh visited the Newfoundland Housing and Homelessness Network on Tuesday morning\u00a0to share the party's plan for the province.\n\"I know that right now in Newfoundland and Labrador, there's a lot of struggles,\" he said.\n\"Things are getting more and more expensive, people are working harder and harder but they're not getting ahead.\u2026\u00a0That's something we've got to change.\"\nSingh, who was born in Scarborough, Ont., moved with his family to Newfoundland and Labrador when he was one.

That's the lowest range since the summer of 2017, he says, and a big reason why is the bond market.\nUnlike variable rate loans which take their cues from the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate, lenders finance fixed-rate loans based on the rates they can get in the bond market. Essentially, they'll borrow money themselves at one rate, loan it out to a borrower at a higher rate\u00a0and make money on that spread.\nSo current rock-bottom interest rates on fixed loans are no coincidence, considering the yield on a five-year Government of Canada bond dipped below 1.3 per cent this month. If a lender can borrow funds for as little as 1.3 per cent then turn around and make money by loaning it out for twice that rate, they have every incentive to keep offering those deals.\n\"The hard cost of funding these loans is going down,\" Laird said. \"And at the same time we are at the tail end of the most competitive market, when lenders fight for [business], so that's when they are willing to thin out their margins a bit to attract volume.\"\nVariable rate loans are also sliding lower, too.\nMost borrowers prefer the peace of mind\u00a0of fixed rate loans, but lenders can tempt borrowers to variable rate loans with even better rates \u2014 even if they're only temporary.\nLaird says typically it takes a spread of about a full percentage point to entice most people to make the leap. Which is why those loans are even less popular than usual because that premium has almost completely vanished.\nHe says the best variable rate loans are about 2.65 per cent at the moment, which is barely better than the fixed rate, for a lot more risk.\nAnyone signing up for that loan today is \"assuming the Bank of Canada is going to be forced to drop their rate once or twice. That would be the only way to justify taking it,\" he said. The bank's benchmark rate is 1.75 per cent.\u00a0\nTrading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors think there's about a 50 per cent chance of a rate cut by the central bank\u00a0this year \u2014 but two would be very unlikely, and never mind any more beyond that.\nLower rates could be good news for those who've already bought, too.\nA recent report by National Bank found that a little more than one out of every six mortgages in Canada is up for renewal this year, and as recently as January the bank was calculating that most of them could expect to be paying between 70 and 90 more basis points on their next loan than they were on their current one. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point, so a jump of 70 basis points would be a loan that went from 3 to 3.7 per cent, for example.)\nBut thanks to the steep slide\u00a0in mortgage rates since the start of the year, most people with loans\u00a0up for renewal now have no need to fear a big jump in their rate when the time comes.\n\"With the recent drop in mortgage rates, those households will be renewing at rates barely above their previous ones,\" National Bank economist Matthieu Arseneau\u00a0said.\nLaird doesn't see anything on the immediate horizon that could derail the era of lower rates, but he does think the federal election in October is worth paying attention to for how it relates to housing.\nHousing policy is bound to come up on the campaign trail, and he expects to hear a lot of talk about changing stress test rules and extending amortization periods in the coming months.\nBut until that happens, Laird's expectations for the mortgage market can be summed up succinctly:\u00a0\"Pretty cheap money.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "How gentrification shrunk a historic Toronto neighbourhood", "description": "Influx of wealthy new residents drove up prices and the overall population down", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/archives/how-gentrification-shrunk-a-historic-toronto-neighbourhood-1.5249594", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Aug 19, 2019 10:30 AM ET", "2019-08-19T15:38:44.544Z"], "source": "CBC Archives", "content": "It was what we would call gentrification today and four decades ago, it was changing life in a\u00a0historic Toronto neighbourhood.\nCabbagetown, an area where working-class people had lived for decades, was seeing much more affluent people move in.\n\"Money pervades Cabbagetown now \u2014 big money,\" reporter Russ Patrick told viewers on The National in August of 1978.\nThat incoming wealth was driving up housing prices, giving opportunity to those who had bought homes there\u00a0in the past to sell.\nAnd it was also pushing out those who rented.\nIn fact, this overall change in circumstances in Cabbagetown was causing a sharp drop in the population there.\n\"Ten thousand fewer people live in Cabbagetown now than did six years ago,\" said Patrick.\u00a0\n\"That's because so many houses that used to provide cheap accommodation for 10 or 20 people now are homes for singles, or working couples or small families.\"\nDavid Morley, a professor at York University, studied population shifts in Canadian cities,\u00a0such as what had been occurring in Cabbagetown.\nHe believed it was necessary to consider the long-term effects of such changes in population.\n\"It's all too easy for us ... to assume that it's all going to work out alright, that the big city like Toronto or like other large cities in Canada can absorb new people moving around in them, without really recognizing there's a profound social change going on, behind all this,\" Morley told The National.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1581305923686", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Ross Andersen", "title": "Mural project aims to show the bigger picture of Halifax's Mulgrave Park", "description": "Paint the Park co-ordinator aims to add a dozen murals in the community", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mulgrave-park-mural-project-1.5173859", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5174637.1560463538!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mural-tyler-richards.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 13, 2019 6:11 PM AT", "2019-06-13T21:11:03.751Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Jeremy Williams began his first mural project, it was to honour late friend\u00a0Tyler Richards.\n\"When he passed away I felt the need to share his impact on the community, and now his mural means the world to us,\" said Williams, co-ordinator of the Paint the Park project.\nThree years later, street art has transformed Mulgrave Park's\u00a0outdoor space into a public art gallery, with huge murals painted on the sides of the buildings in the public housing development in north-end Halifax.\nWilliams is hoping to erect at least a dozen additional pieces this\u00a0August.\n\"Our goal is to make Mulgrave Park the art hub of Halifax,\" he said.\nA diverse lineup of local and international artists will paint the murals,\u00a0including one of\u00a0Viola Desmond and another of the Bluenose.\nWilliams expects this summer's Paint the Park event\u00a0to be the biggest yet.\nHe said this time\u00a0it will reflect the people who live in the community.

The procedure can be uncomfortable. Microbiologist Craig Jenne tells CBC News that false negatives can be blamed on non-co-operative patients or on somebody who has never done a nasal swab before. In other cases, a throat swab may not reach the virus.\nDr. Christopher Labos, an epidemiologist and cardiologist in Montreal, believes timing is a bigger factor. \"There's some evidence now to suggest that if you were only tested three to four days or a week after your symptoms start, your levels are going to be lower,\" he said, which makes it harder for the virus to show up on a test. \"We are probably underreporting cases a little bit.\"\nTonight, CBC News is holding a virtual town hall featuring a range of public health experts and special guests who will answer some of the questions audience members have submitted.

The current version limits assessment increases to the consumer price index.\nBut municipal leaders believe it is distorting the system, allowing some homeowners to save some money on property taxes\u00a0while others who aren't under the cap pay more.\nNeil Lovitt, a vice-president with\u00a0real-estate consultant Turner Drake, agrees.\n\"For every person it helps validly, it is quite backwards for 10 times as many cases,\" said Lovitt.\nThe cap does not apply to apartment buildings where increases are passed on to tenants. The cap is also lifted if a home is renovated or sold, creating vastly different tax bills for similar houses on the same street.\nThe situation can affect seniors who want to downsize or young families buying a home for the first time. In both cases they can end up with much higher property assessments when the cap is lifted for a sale.\nAccording to Turner Drake, the municipalities with the largest gaps between market value assessments and the capped assessments are Cape Breton Regional Municipality and Municipality of Pictou County.\nThe Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities wants to phase out the cap over 13 years, but will retain a spike-protection mechanism that would prevent assessments from increasing more than 10 per cent a year.\nMunicipalities would also have to offer assistance to low-income residents, and as the cap is phased out they would be obligated to lower the tax rates by the same amount.\nThe president of the federation said the change would be \"revenue neutral.\"\n\"This is all about equity and fairness in the tax system,\" said Pam Mood, who is also the mayor of Yarmouth. \"The cap is not working.\"\nAn all-party committee met Wednesday to begin discussions. The leader of the NDP, Gary Burrill, said he is cautious about any proposed changes.\n\"The NDP was involved in bringing about the cap in the first place,\" said Burrill. \"The principle that no one should be taxed out of their home is one we continue to honour.\"\nThe issue also makes the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party nervous.\n\"I always worry about the ramifications on people, real impacts that the government hasn't thought of,\" said Tim Houston.\nThe Liberal member of the committee said it is too early to prejudge the proposal.\n\"This is a very complex issue that has a lot tentacles into the economy, real estate, low-income housing, rental markets, homeowners, immigration,\" said Keith Irving, the MLA for Kings South,\n\"I\u00a0think we are going to have a lot of

housing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0particularly in downtown Halifax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a study by researchers at McGill University has found.\nResearcher David Wachsmuth told CBC's Maritime Noon on Tuesday there are neighbourhoods in central Halifax where more than two per cent of the housing is listed full time on Airbnb.\n\"That's housing that's been\u00a0taken totally off the rental market,\" he said.\nThe study found there were 2,420 short-term rentals active in the municipality on Aug.\u00a031, 2019.\u00a0Wachsmuth\u00a0said about a third of those listings are believed to be full-time operations.\n\"Those 700 or 800 units are having a major impact on people's ability to find an apartment to rent at a decent price in Halifax right now,\"\u00a0Wachsmuth\u00a0said.\nHe said that's a large number for a city Halifax's size.\nThe report found the rental vacancy rate in Halifax was 1.6\u00a0per cent.\nAccording to a report from Royal Bank of Canada Economics released in September, an ideal vacancy rate would be three per cent.\n\"Notably, real rent generally declines when the vacancy rate climbs above three\u00a0per cent,\" the report noted.\u00a0\n\"So housing policy that ultimately raises a market's vacancy rate to, say, something closer to four\u00a0per cent\u00a0has a good chance of generating meaningful rent relief.\"\nThe McGill study said that if commercial short-term rentals were converted back to long-term housing, the rental vacancy rate would increase to 2.8 per cent in the short term.\nThe provincial and municipal governments are looking to regulate short-term rentals, possibly in 2020.\nThe Halifax Regional Municipality and the province have\u00a0surveys available on short-term rentals. The deadline for the provincial survey is Nov. 20\u00a0and the deadline for the Halifax survey is 10 days later.\nWachsmuth\u00a0said the province should consider limiting short-term rentals to primary residences.\n\"In other words, if this is home sharing, you've got a spare bedroom or you're out of town for the whole weekend, you should be able to do what you want with your home including rent it to somebody whose visiting,\" Wachsmuth said.\n\"But we should be really sceptical about commercial operators who want to take entire apartments, entire homes and convert them into effectively full-time hotels\u00a0because that's activity that's really coming at a cost to local residents.\"\nHe said in neighbourhoods that are attractive to tourists, locals will have an increasingly harder time finding long-term housing \"because tourists are basically outbidding local residents\" through short-term rentals.\nBill Stewart, a spokesperson for the group Neighbours Speak Up, a group that formed out of concerns over Airbnbs in Halifax's north end, told CBC's Mainstreet on Tuesday that one thing that stood out to\u00a0him about the McGill study was that more than 40 per cent of the listings are properties where an owner owns multiple properties.\n\"We see the major irritant in this situation being in the kind of commercial short-term rental, where the owner doesn't reside in it and has another property and so on,\" Stewart said.\n\"We think these are commercial businesses and have no place in a residential area.\"\nNeighbours Speak Up is holding a presentation on short-term rentals with Wachsmuth at the Halifax Central Library on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Single parents hit hard by food insecurity", "description": "The year-long series explores why so many in N.L. are struggling to put food on the table", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/fed-up-part-1-single-parents-1.5426188", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 19, 2020 8:00 AM NT", "2020-02-19T14:14:45.991Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Feeding her three children is something Dara Squires loses sleep over.\u00a0\n\"There's definitely probably hours a day that, you know, you're sitting at work and you're like, 'OK, got to get home, feed the kids.

Do I need to come up with something else?'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"I spend a lot of hours in the evening kind of trying to come up with ways to make more money \u2026 so that we're a little more comfortable. So it's difficult to balance those needs a lot of the time.\"\nSquires, a working single mother of three,\u00a0is part of the growing number of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians facing food insecurity \u2014\u00a0the struggle to afford food or have access to food. This province has the highest rate of food insecurity among Canadian provinces.\u00a0\nAnd, according to data compiled by Proof Canada \u2014 a research team that investigates and publishes annual reports on food insecurity using data from Statistics Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0single parents just like Squires\u00a0are the most likely to face food insecurity in the province.\nThe issue is one the Single Parent\u00a0Association of Newfoundland\u00a0is familiar with.\u00a0\n\"The majority is single moms,\"\u00a0said Elaine Balsam, the group's executive director.\u00a0\n\"Some are working at low wages, and they are not making ends meet. They do not have the food, they run out. So there's severe cases.\"\nBalsam said with some jobs offering only part-time hours, some single parents are working two or three jobs to get food on the table and keep the household afloat.\u00a0\n\"When you have to choose between paying the bills and food? Food usually comes near the end,\" she said.\nSometimes parents make another challenging sacrifice: skipping meals to make sure their children don't go hungry,\u00a0said Natasha Bader,\u00a0co-ordinator at the St. John's Women's Centre.\nFood insecurity can have a wide-ranging\u00a0impact on children, too. It can affect their behaviour and their ability to learn in school. Food insecurity can also limit their opportunities for growth and development, engaging with their friends and community.\n\u00a0\nSummer camp is one example, said\u00a0Ellie Jones, program director at Thrive, a non-profit organization that provides programs and services for vulnerable people.\u00a0Since children can't use services like school lunch programs, the demand for food in the summer can be even\u00a0greater in some cases.\n\"They might be fortunate enough to go to camp, but they don't have food to send with them to camp, a\u00a0lunch or a snack,\" Jones said, which can have a stigma attached to it.\u00a0\nSo, what makes single parents more susceptible to food insecurity? A lack of high-paying employment and a missing second income are among the top reasons, according to Valerie Tarasuk, a professor at the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.\n\"If we've got two adults, we've got two kicks at the can,\" Tarasuk said.\nThe wage gap is another obstacle for single mothers to overcome, said Tarasuk.\u00a0\n\"There's lots of studies showing that women in Canada on average make less than men. Employment is more difficult for them,\" she said.\n\"If you've got a lone parent, a woman trying to manage that situation, [they are] just less able to have had the opportunities to amass that financial cushion.\"\nAnd if you think only people who are unemployed or who rely on social assistance are facing food insecurity, think again, said Tarasuk.\n\"The rise we've seen in Newfoundland and Labrador in terms of food insecurity rates not only suggests that there is increasing vulnerability amongst people on social assistance \u2014\u00a0but also that more people in the workforce are struggling,\" she said.\nChild-care costs can eat up a significant chunk of a household income, leaving less money for groceries, said Balsam.\n\"Some people even delay returning to work until their children are in school because\u00a0basically they're working a low-paying job \u2026 to pay child care \u2014 and they can't get ahead that way,\" she said.\nIt is a cycle that can be\u00a0hard to get out, said Danielle Douglas, an organizer with\u00a0Parents for Affordable Childcare in Newfoundland and Labrador, a grassroots organization advocating for quality affordable and accessible child care.\n\"What's being shared amongst the members in our network is that a lot of individuals, most of which are women, cannot return to work because they cannot afford to work. They cannot afford the cost of child care.\"\nOther line items in a household budget\u00a0are on the rise, too, like\u00a0the prices of housing and electricity.\nAnd the looming possibility of even higher power bills\u00a0is top of mind, said Jones.\u00a0\n\"If you don't pay your power bill and get that disconnected, you run your risk of being evicted. And housing trumps whether or not you've got food in your fridge,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of food insecurity is not being able to afford quality food \u2014\u00a0fresh fruit, vegetables, and other staples of a balanced diet.\u00a0\nThe average Canadian family will pay up to an extra $487 for food this year, according to Canada's Food Price Report 2020.\n\"Look, it was only a few months ago that celery was $9.99. Like, who's paying 10 bucks for celery?\" said Heather Bartlett, executive director at\u00a0Daybreak Parent Child Centre in St. John's.\nFresh produce generally costs more than pre-packaged, processed food, and that's one reason more families are buying lower-quality\u00a0food, in order to try to stretch their budget, she said.\n\"I've heard a lot of our families say that they're buying their groceries at Dollarama,\" Bartlett said. \"You can't purchase fresh fruits or vegetables at Dollarama.\"\nThe anxiety that often accompanies the concern about having enough food can manifest as shame, said Bader.\u00a0\nAnd it isn't something that's talked about often.\n\"[People] don't want to be pointed out or have to tell their story, because there is a lot of stigma attached. Or there's assumptions in place about addictions.\u00a0That's just a lot of judgments put onto the person, so they don't want to come forward.\"\nSquires can relate to that, saying her experiences have changed her view on assumptions like these.\n\"I think sometimes people look at families that are struggling and are like 'Well, you know, if they're struggling why are they doing this thing?' But often that's the thing keeping them sane,\" Squires said.\n\"I never judge a parent who smokes or has a drink on a Friday night or something like that, because there are so many things you don't see that they're giving up.\"\nOne thing is for certain, say all four women:\u00a0the solution\u00a0to food insecurity isn't going to come overnight.\nBalsam, Bader, Bartlett and Jones say some sort of policy or all-encompassing approach\u00a0is overdue, but in the meantime, several changes could create some momentum in tackling the issue.\nFor Bader, that starts with addressing\u00a0the province's minimum wage. It's the second lowest in Canada at $11.40 an hour.\n\"I think there's an assumption or a bias around that, you know, it might be people on social assistance who struggle with food insecurity,\" Bader said.\n\"In fact, it's people in general, making minimum wage who struggle with food insecurity as well.\"\nSquires wants to see a drop in food prices, and more support for those who wonder how they'll provide meals for their families.\u00a0\n\"The price of [food] just keeps going up and up and up. And the income isn't going up with it,\" she said.\n\"There's no one you can go to as a parent, I mean, and say 'I need some kind of food credit this month' or something like that.\"\nBalsam said people need to ditch their assumptions and be in tune with the struggles people in their community are facing.\u00a0\n\"It's everyone's problem. It's not just problems of a single parent,\" she said.\u00a0\"Once we get the community on board, this will help everyone in the long run.\"\nFed Up is a yearlong series by CBC NL, in collaboration with Food First NL,\u00a0exploring the issues surrounding food insecurity and why many people in the province are struggling to access food.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Drew Anderson", "title": "Protesters oppose possible 250% price hike to low-income transit pass", "description": "150 march on City Hall as debate begins on whether to cut taxes and services", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/low-income-transit-pass-price-hike-march-1.5372521", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5372560.1574711028!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/keep-calgary-strong.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 25, 2019 12:31 PM MT", "2019-11-25T21:06:45.788Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "About 150 people marched on Calgary City Hall on Monday in order to show opposition to possible price hikes for the\u00a0low-income transit pass.\nIt comes on the day council started a marathon session to debate its budget, and whether to cut services and eliminate jobs in order to reduce\u00a0or eliminate property tax increases.\nAround 66,000 Calgarians rely on the sliding-scale low-income transit pass, which at the lowest level costs $5.30 per month.

What am I going to make for them? Do I have the ingredients I need? If I don't have the ingredients, do I have enough money to go buy them? Do I need to come up with something else?'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"I spend a lot of hours in the evening kind of trying to come up with ways to make more money \u2026 so that we're a little more comfortable. So it's difficult to balance those needs a lot of the time.\"\nSquires, a working single mother of three,\u00a0is part of the growing number of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians facing food insecurity \u2014\u00a0the struggle to afford food or have access to food. This province has the highest rate of food insecurity among Canadian provinces.\u00a0\nAnd, according to data compiled by Proof Canada \u2014 a research team that investigates and publishes annual reports on food insecurity using data from Statistics Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0single parents just like Squires\u00a0are the most likely to face food insecurity in the province.\nThe issue is one the Single Parent\u00a0Association of Newfoundland\u00a0is familiar with.\u00a0\n\"The majority is single moms,\"\u00a0said Elaine Balsam, the group's executive director.\u00a0\n\"Some are working at low wages, and they are not making ends meet. They do not have the food, they run out. So there's severe cases.\"\nBalsam said with some jobs offering only part-time hours, some single parents are working two or three jobs to get food on the table and keep the household afloat.\u00a0\n\"When you have to choose between paying the bills and food? Food usually comes near the end,\" she said.\nSometimes parents make another challenging sacrifice: skipping meals to make sure their children don't go hungry,\u00a0said Natasha Bader,\u00a0co-ordinator at the St. John's Women's Centre.\nFood insecurity can have a wide-ranging\u00a0impact on children, too. It can affect their behaviour and their ability to learn in school. Food insecurity can also limit their opportunities for growth and development, engaging with their friends and community.\n\u00a0\nSummer camp is one example, said\u00a0Ellie Jones, program director at Thrive, a non-profit organization that provides programs and services for vulnerable people.\u00a0Since children can't use services like school lunch programs, the demand for food in the summer can be even\u00a0greater in some cases.\n\"They might be fortunate enough to go to camp, but they don't have food to send with them to camp, a\u00a0lunch or a snack,\" Jones said, which can have a stigma attached to it.\u00a0\nSo, what makes single parents more susceptible to food insecurity? A lack of high-paying employment and a missing second income are among the top reasons, according to Valerie Tarasuk, a professor at the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.\n\"If we've got two adults, we've got two kicks at the can,\" Tarasuk said.\nThe wage gap is another obstacle for single mothers to overcome, said Tarasuk.\u00a0\n\"There's lots of studies showing that women in Canada on average make less than men. Employment is more difficult for them,\" she said.\n\"If you've got a lone parent, a woman trying to manage that situation, [they are] just less able to have had the opportunities to amass that financial cushion.\"\nAnd if you think only people who are unemployed or who rely on social assistance are facing food insecurity, think again, said Tarasuk.\n\"The rise we've seen in Newfoundland and Labrador in terms of food insecurity rates not only suggests that there is increasing vulnerability amongst people on social assistance \u2014\u00a0but also that more people in the workforce are struggling,\" she said.\nChild-care costs can eat up a significant chunk of a household income, leaving less money for groceries, said Balsam.\n\"Some people even delay returning to work until their children are in school because\u00a0basically they're working a low-paying job \u2026 to pay child care \u2014 and they can't get ahead that way,\" she said.\nIt is a cycle that can be\u00a0hard to get out, said Danielle Douglas, an organizer with\u00a0Parents for Affordable Childcare in Newfoundland and Labrador, a grassroots organization advocating for quality affordable and accessible child care.\n\"What's being shared amongst the members in our network is that a lot of individuals, most of which are women, cannot return to work because they cannot afford to work. They cannot afford the cost of child care.\"\nOther line items in a household budget\u00a0are on the rise, too, like\u00a0the prices of housing and electricity.\nAnd the looming possibility of even higher power bills\u00a0is top of mind, said Jones.\u00a0\n\"If you don't pay your power bill and get that disconnected, you run your risk of being evicted. And housing trumps whether or not you've got food in your fridge,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of food insecurity is not being able to afford quality food \u2014\u00a0fresh fruit, vegetables, and other staples of a balanced diet.\u00a0\nThe average Canadian family will pay up to an extra $487 for food this year, according to Canada's Food Price Report 2020.\n\"Look, it was only a few months ago that celery was $9.99. Like, who's paying 10 bucks for celery?\" said Heather Bartlett, executive director at\u00a0Daybreak Parent Child Centre in St. John's.\nFresh produce generally costs more than pre-packaged, processed food, and that's one reason more families are buying lower-quality\u00a0food, in order to try to stretch their budget, she said.\n\"I've heard a lot of our families say that they're buying their groceries at Dollarama,\" Bartlett said. \"You can't purchase fresh fruits or vegetables at Dollarama.\"\nThe anxiety that often accompanies the concern about having enough food can manifest as shame, said Bader.\u00a0\nAnd it isn't something that's talked about often.\n\"[People] don't want to be pointed out or have to tell their story, because there is a lot of stigma attached. Or there's assumptions in place about addictions.\u00a0That's just a lot of judgments put onto the person, so they don't want to come forward.\"\nSquires can relate to that, saying her experiences have changed her view on assumptions like these.\n\"I think sometimes people look at families that are struggling and are like 'Well, you know, if they're struggling why are they doing this thing?' But often that's the thing keeping them sane,\" Squires said.\n\"I never judge a parent who smokes or has a drink on a Friday night or something like that, because there are so many things you don't see that they're giving up.\"\nOne thing is for certain, say all four women:\u00a0the solution\u00a0to food insecurity isn't going to come overnight.\nBalsam, Bader, Bartlett and Jones say some sort of policy or all-encompassing approach\u00a0is overdue, but in the meantime, several changes could create some momentum in tackling the issue.\nFor Bader, that starts with addressing\u00a0the province's minimum wage. It's the second lowest in Canada at $11.40 an hour.\n\"I think there's an assumption or a bias around that, you know, it might be people on social assistance who struggle with food insecurity,\" Bader said.\n\"In fact, it's people in general, making minimum wage who struggle with food insecurity as well.\"\nSquires wants to see a drop in food prices, and more support for those who wonder how they'll provide meals for their families.\u00a0\n\"The price of [food] just keeps going up and up and up. And the income isn't going up with it,\" she said.\n\"There's no one you can go to as a parent, I mean, and say 'I need some kind of food credit this month' or something like that.\"\nBalsam said people need to ditch their assumptions and be in tune with the struggles people in their community are facing.\u00a0\n\"It's everyone's problem. It's not just problems of a single parent,\" she said.\u00a0\"Once we get the community on board, this will help everyone in the long run.\"\nFed Up is a yearlong series by CBC NL, in collaboration with Food First NL,\u00a0exploring the issues surrounding food insecurity and why many people in the province are struggling to access food.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Port Hawkesbury Paper cutting wood deliveries due to declining markets, COVID-19", "description": "Nova Scotia sawmills expecting almost immediate effects from the change", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/covid-19-forestry-pulp-and-paper-mills-industry-1.5503536", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1907265.1380867429!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-ns-port-hawkesbury-paper-8col.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 20, 2020 6:00 AM AT", "2020-03-20T09:00:00.099Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Nova Scotia's last major mill will curtail buying wood in April and scale back planned deliveries in May as it deals with ongoing market decline, compounded by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The move is the latest blow to a forestry industry struggling to maintain a toehold following the loss of its major player.\nA spokesperson for Port Hawkesbury Paper confirmed the decision in an email on Thursday.\n\"This situation is evolving, and we will continue to monitor and adjust as required,\" said Andrew Fedora.\n\"We are very cognizant of and regret the impact these actions will have on all those affected. This will not have an impact on deliveries of paper to our customers.\"\nFedora said\u00a0deliveries are generally reduced during this time of year due to soft ground conditions and spring weight restrictions\u00a0throughout the industry.\nThe move will have an immediate effect on sawmills in the province, most notably Ledwidge Lumber and Scotsburn Lumber, which had been sending wood and chips to Port Hawkesbury\u00a0Paper since\u00a0the closure of Northern Pulp at the end of January.\nIn an email, Ledwidge Lumber said the company laid off 40 per cent of its sawmill staff \u2014 33 full-time employees \u2014 as of Friday with \"more to follow in the coming days.\" It also said all roundwood deliveries are shut off for an indefinite period of time.\n\"Unfortunately, actions in the marketplace are further devaluing woodlots and therefore our home-grown businesses in rural Nova Scotia are suffering,\" said\u00a0company president Douglas Ledwidge in the email.\nThe email said Northern Pulp's closure had left the forestry scrambling to find a home for sawmill leftovers.\n\"Losing another big customer of these products \u2013 even temporarily \u2014\u00a0in the province is disastrous for the industry as a whole,\" the email said.\nAlthough there have been various slowdowns in the past at Port Hawkesbury Paper, members of the forestry industry said Thursday they've always been able to weather that because they had Northern Pulp to fall back on. That changed when the Pictou County pulp mill was forced to shut after it failed to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment site.\nStephen Cole, a forester and partner with woodlot management company H.C. Haynes, said their operation will lose yet another market for chips with the change at\u00a0Port Hawkesbury\u00a0Paper.\nWhen Northern Pulp went down, Port Hawkesbury Paper started taking chips and pulpwood from the mainland to try to help people continue to operate. But company officials have always said it could only be a temporary arrangement because they could never buy as much wood as Northern Pulp, which had larger capacity.\n\"They're not using more wood, they're just buying more wood, meaning at some point their yard is going to get full and they're going to have to stop,\" said Cole.\n\"It bought us some time and I'm glad they did do that for us. They didn't have to.\"\nWith contractors unable to send wood to Port Hawkesbury, Cole said there would be more limitations on\u00a0what woodlots can be worked, something that will trickle down to woodlot owners, who have already experienced big drops in the value of their investments. Nobody goes into the woods to just cut pulp, said Cole, but having that pulp to cut makes a harvest on a block of land more economical.\n\"It's about 20 to 30 per cent of the wood on an acre,\" he said. \"There's pulp in almost every woodlot in Nova Scotia, if not every woodlot.\"\nRobin Wilber, president of Elmsdale Lumber Company, said the lumber industry is cyclical and, in the past, they've been able to survive low prices because they got good prices from Northern Pulp for byproducts.\nWhen rectangular pieces of wood are made from round pieces of wood, what's left over is the \"absolute best quality wood fibre in the world,\" said Wilber.\n\"That sold for a good price to make good, high-quality paper products.\"\nThe provincial government has been trying to help the industry transition to a future beyond Northern Pulp. However, much of that work entails consultation and meetings, many of which will likely have to change as COVID-19 turns almost everything upside down.\nAs most Nova Scotians have their eyes fixed on what's happening at home with the spread of the virus, Wilber said he's watching what's happening in the United States, and in particular what the pandemic will do to that country's economy and housing market.\n\"If lumber markets fall, I'm not sure how the industry survives because we don't have our backup that we used to have,\" he said.\nThe market right now is reasonable, certainly benefiting from a favourable exchange rate, \"but we're afraid of what's coming,\" said Wilber.\nCole isn't feeling much more optimistic.\n\"I've heard this a hundred times: 'Well, we should diversify, we shouldn't have all our eggs in one basket.' We didn't. Northern [Pulp] was a big one, but it wasn't our only basket. Now we have our eggs in one basket and you can see what's happening.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Fed chair sees North America as an economic oasis in 2020: Don Pittis", "description": "Solidifying our trade link with the U.S. means optimism could spread north next year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fed-economy-future-1.5391444", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393240.1576103971!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-fed.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-12T09:00:00.793Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A positive outlook for the North American economy means the U.S. Fed has largely taken rate cuts off the table in 2020.\u00a0But for Canadians looking for new mortgages and renewals, the good news is that rate hikes are unlikely, too.\nAs usual, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell added the proviso that the central bank would not hesitate to stimulate the economy again if the U.S. were to be hit by an unpleasant economic\u00a0surprise.\u00a0\nBut unlike U.S. President Donald Trump and many market commentators,\u00a0Powell and his advisers foresee no need for more interest rate cuts in the coming year.

Freight shipments from Lewisporte were stopped when the Woodward Group and Labrador Marine were contracted to start shipping from Happy Valley-Goose Bay.

head of Canada's central bank in 2013, Poloz was chief executive of Export Development Canada.\nPoloz, the bank's ninth governor,\u00a0replaced Mark Carney, who left the Bank of Canada to become governor of the Bank of England.\u00a0\nSherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said Poloz had big shoes to fill and has done well.\n\"I think he has done a great job,\" Cooper said. \"If you just look at the Canadian economy, it's been remarkably stable.\"\nPoloz's term expires on June 2.\n\"The role of governor of the Bank of Canada has been my dream job,\"\u00a0Poloz, 64, said in a written statement about his decision.\u00a0\"I will leave it next June with gratitude and great pride.\"\nThe board of directors of the central bank says it has begun a search process to select his replacement.\nThe statement also notes that during Poloz's time as governor, the bank has \"created the conditions for steady economic growth, low unemployment\u00a0and inflation close to target through very challenging times.\"\nThe board of directors of the central bank said it has begun a search for his replacement.\nThe Bank of Canada expects to complete the recruitment process by the spring of next year and, subject to approval by the federal finance minister and cabinet, have Poloz's replacement in place for June 3, 2020.\nCarolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor, is most often mentioned as a possible successor to Poloz, who has been strongly supportive of his second-in-command at the bank.\nWilkins has often taken the lead in answering questions regarding the central bank's monetary policy report, and the senior deputy governor sometimes makes the opening statement.\nHowever, being senior deputy governor\u00a0is no guarantee of the top job. Tiff Macklem, the senior deputy governor under Carney, was passed over in favour of Poloz.\nOther possible successors include Jean Boivin, global head of research for the BlackRock Investment Institute and a former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, and Paul Rochon, the deputy minister at the Finance Department.\nCooper pointed to Evan Siddall, the chief executive at Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., as another possible replacement, but added that Wilkins is the most likely candidate.\n\"I think they'd like to have a woman for the first time as the governor of the Bank of Canada,\" she said.\nPoloz surprised financial markets when he cut the bank's key interest rate in January 2015 by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75 per cent in response to a sharp drop in oil prices.\nThe governor was criticized by some for not signalling to investors the possibility of a rate cut, but he defended the decision by saying that statements that explicitly guide market expectations are best reserved for extraordinary times.\nThe interest rate cut proved to be prescient as the drop in oil prices took a bite out the economy that year, and Poloz moved to cut the bank's key rate again in July 2015.\nIn an effort to improve communications, the Bank of Canada began last year having a member of its governing council give a public speech a day or so after interest rate announcements that do not also come with an accompanying monetary policy report.\nThe search for a new Bank of Canada governor comes at an interesting time for the central bank.\nThe bank kept its key interest rate on hold at 1.75 per cent when it made its rate announcement earlier this week, but many economists have suggested it may look to cut its key interest rate early next year.\nThe Bank of Canada has kept its overnight rate target on hold for more than a year due to what it has said has been the resilience in the Canadian economy.\nIn doing so, the central bank has stood out from many of its international peers that have moved to loosen monetary policy and cut interest rates in response to worries about a weakening global economy.\n"}, {"author": "Eric Rankin", "title": "B.C.'s housing speculation tax faces first major legal challenge", "description": "Lawsuit alleges tax is unconstitutional and beyond power of B.C. government", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-s-housing-speculation-tax-faces-first-legal-challenge-1.5297789", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297799.1569470023!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/this-oak-bay-home-is-at-the-heart-of-a-lawsuit-challenging-b-c-s-speculation-tax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 9:05 AM PT", "2019-09-26T18:29:35.625Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Six homeowners have launched a legal fight against B.C.'s Speculation and Vacancy Tax \u2014 the only major lawsuit over the tax to reach the courts.\nIn a lawsuit filed Thursday, the homeowners\u00a0claim the speculation tax unfairly targets residents and out-of-country Canadians who split their time between two homes \u2014 many of them retirees with limited income, who are house rich but cash poor.\nThe civil action alleges the levy\u00a0is unconstitutional, infringes on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and is beyond the power of the provincial government.\nIt seeks\u00a0an injunction to stop the province from imposing the tax.\u00a0\nThe lead plaintiffs in the case are an elderly couple from Oak Bay near Victoria \u2014\u00a0Denise Pettersson Simpson, 72, a Canadian citizen, and her husband\u00a0Robert Simpson, 93, a U.S. war veteran who received a Purple Heart after\u00a0being injured in the line of duty.\nThey spend part of the year in Texas, where Robert gets medical care covered by his U.S. military service, and part of the year in the B.C. family home where Denise grew up.\n\"I love this house and I don't want to lose it,\" says Denise Simpson. \"I'm a Canadian.

I couldn't understand how this could apply to us,\" says Denise Simpson. \"We didn't buy the house, we inherited it. We're not speculators.\"\nThe B.C. government imposed the speculation tax in November 2018, saying it was designed to target foreign and domestic real estate speculators, turn empty homes into affordable housing, and generate tax revenue to be used for housing initiatives.\nRich offshore investors have been blamed for driving up market prices \u2014 buying homes and condos for investment purposes, often leaving them empty.\nThe Simpsons allege they've fallen victim to an overly broad tax.\nThey say they've repeatedly declined purchase offers from speculators, and recently paid off the Oak Bay mortgage so Denise could move back to Canada permanently after Robert dies.\nNow they face an uncertain future.\n\"We were in the act of settling in when this hit,\" says Robert Simpson.\u00a0\"[We're]\u00a0surprised the government greed for money could drive us out of here.\"\nIn July, the B.C. government revealed the speculation tax is expected to put $115 million into provincial coffers this year.\nThe Simpsons say they can only take part in the lawsuit because it's being handled pro bono \u2014\u00a0without charge \"for the public good\" \u2014 by a Vancouver-based law firm.\nLawyer Kailin Che says the firm hopes to finance the legal costs by crowdfunding through a website called \"saynotospectax.com.\"\nThere was a similar attempt last year to raise funds online for a different speculation tax challenge on behalf of Alberta-based B.C. property owners, which\u00a0has yet to proceed.\nBut Che\u00a0says this case will be fought in court \u2014 and could grow.\n\"I believe this petition is the first step to building a larger constitutional challenge that might evolve into a greater class action,\" says Che. \"And we anticipate there will be other lawsuits to follow.\"\nThe civil action alleges the speculation tax \"infringes the petitioners' right to liberty protected\" under the charter.\n\"Choosing where to establish one's home is a quintessentially private decision that goes to the very heart of personal autonomy,\" states the lawsuit. \"The state should not be permitted to interfere in this private decision-making process \u2026 the act effectively coerces the petitioners to rent out their homes.\"\nThe B.C. government has yet to file a legal response. The allegations have not been proven in court.\nDenise Simpson says renting out her family home to strangers isn't an option \u2014 it's full of family memorabilia and memories.\nThe thought of being forced to put the house on the market brings her close to tears.\n\"I would have a total breakdown if I had to sell this \u2026 I'd be devastated, crying,\" she said. \"It'd be like losing a family member.\"\n\"I would never get over having to lose this house.

But the provincial government ordered the salaries be made public as part of a larger move to shake up the new home warranty program earlier this year.\nThe newly released document shows the President and CEO of Tarion, Howard Bogach, earned $681,616 in base salary and incentives in 2018, and an additional $87,794 in car allowance and pension contributions.\n\u00a0In total, Tarion paid out more than $4 million in executive compensation last year. The corporation also paid $520,000 to its 16\u00a0board members, half of which typically have experience in the\u00a0homebuilding industry.\n\"It's pretty outrageous,\" said Karen Somerville, president of Canadians for Properly Built Homes (CPBH), an advocacy group for consumers of newly built homes.\n\"We would encourage [Consumer Services Minister Lisa] Thompson and Premier Ford to take a hard look and consider capping their salaries, as they did in the case of Hydro One.\"\nLast year the government stepped in to cap the base salary of Hydro One's CEO at just $500,000\u00a0\u2014 though incentives can push the salary as high as $1.5 million.\nA Tarion spokesperson said they did not have access to\u00a0Bogach's base salary before incentives were added.\u00a0\nSomerville suggests the Progressive Conservatives consider a similar cap for Tarion executives, given that Hydro One is a much larger corporation.\n\"We're looking forward to seeing what the Ford Government has to say about this and how they're going to justify this,\" Somerville said.\nTarion is a mandatory service, though many homeowners Somerville deals with don't see the value in what they're paying for, she said.\u00a0\nShe questioned why Tarion only pays out a maximum of $300,000 in settlements for confirmed defects to new homes\u00a0\u2014 an amount she says sometimes doesn't cover the full cost of repairs\u00a0\u2014 when the CEO is making more than double that in a\u00a0year.\n\"Then there are all those other people who have had their claims denied,\" she said.\nIn a statement to CBC, Tarion spokesperson Melanie Kearns\u00a0said the compensation structure is performance based, to attract and retain talent.\n\"We use market salary surveys and independent external HR compensation experts to review our board and executive compensation programs and we benchmark our compensation against Ontario's other\u00a0administrative authorities as well as comparable public sector organizations,\" she wrote.\u00a0\nAs for the board of directors, Tarion's website said members' compensation is reviewed every two years and, with the exception of the board and committee chairs, the board's remuneration hasn't changed since 2005.\u00a0\nThe provincial government has been calling Tarion \"broken,\" since it was elected last year.\nPublishing executives salaries was just the latest of several promises Progressive Conservatives have made when it comes to reforming the home-warranty provider.\nThe government has ordered the creation of a new regulator for the home-building industry in the province in an effort to address the perceived\u00a0conflict of interest of having developers on the board regulating their own industry and resolving disputes between builders and homeowners.\nConsumer Services Minister Lisa Thomson has also floated the idea of ending Tarion's monopoly on home warranties in Ontario and opening the market to other providers.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "What profits at Canada's big banks are saying about the odds of a recession", "description": "Royal and CIBC revealed numbers last week.

That's because Canada's five biggest lenders \u2014 Royal Bank, TD, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and CIBC \u2014 have a hand in nearly every aspect of Canada's economy, from loaning businesses money for expansion to funding the mortgages that finance much of the housing market.\nThose same banks are in the midst of revealing their quarterly earnings this week, and the numbers should offer a good glimpse of where the economy is headed.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada was first to report last week, showing profits rising to a record $3.3 billion\u00a0in the third quarter. CIBC was next, with a quarterly profit of $1.4 billion\u00a0in the three months up to the end of July.\nBoth figures are up only slightly from last year's level, but in a world in which the financial media is warning of negative rates, inverted yields and huge stock market swings on a seemingly daily basis, rising profits are good to see at the banks. Because if the banks are making money, there's a good chance many of their customers are doing well, too.\nThe Bank of Montreal and Scotiabank\u00a0will\u00a0report their earnings\u00a0Tuesday morning. TD's expected to show its hand on Thursday.\u00a0\nWhile the forecast for the two banks we've already heard from was generally sunny, that's not to say there weren't a few clouds on the horizon \u2014 potential storms that investors will be on the lookout for in the other banks' outlooks.\nRoyal managed to grow their residential mortgage business by almost 6 per cent in the past year to $298 billion, an impressive feat considering how big a player they were in the market to begin with. As CBC News has reported, mortgage rates have been headed lower in recent months, a development that's a double-edged sword for banks \u2014 because each mortgage individually is less profitable for them, but they are also able to sell more of them because they appear to be cheaper.\nPolicymakers have spent years worrying about Canadians' debt loads, but Royal Bank's performance suggests there's room for more. Borrowers wouldn't be taking on all that new debt if they weren't feeling confident about their prospects, either. As TD Bank analyst Mario Mendonca put it, \"We expect mortgage growth to make a healthy recovery this quarter, reflecting a reasonably strong spring selling season, particularly in Ontario.\"\nThe mortgage picture\u00a0at CIBC, meanwhile, wasn't quite as rosy. Despite handing out $9 billion in new mortgages during the quarter, the total value of CIBC's mortgages actually shrank by a little more than one per cent\u00a0to $222 billion.\nWorse still for the bank is where many of them are.\u00a0\"CIBC is the most-exposed to mortgage loans in Ontario and British Columbia,\" Bloomberg analyst Paul Gulberg said.\u00a0\nWhile Canada's housing market overall has shown signs of stabilizing, activity in Toronto and Vancouver is still causing worry, so it should be interesting to see what the other banks have to say about their mortgage businesses.\nAnother possible dark cloud on an otherwise blue sky could\u00a0be what the banks are saying about their loans to businesses. That's because both\u00a0banks reported higher credit loss provisions \u2014 money that banks set aside to write off bad loans. While it's still a tiny slice of their overall business, if more businesses are having trouble paying back their bank loans, that's a bad sign for the economy.\u00a0\nAt Royal, credit losses came in at $425 million, a 27 per cent increase year over year. At CIBC, the figure stood at $291 million for the quarter, a 21 per cent increase year over year.\nThe worst part is those credit losses seem to be spreading beyond certain problematic parts of the economy.\n\"It used to be oil and gas but it looks like it has spread ... to some other areas,\" said James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst\u00a0with Edward Jones.\nThe\u00a0oil and gas sector has been hit hard and has been a black mark on Canada's economy for a while, but there's some evidence that weakness is spreading to businesses in forestry, agriculture, and other industries, he said.\n\"It's not too surprising given the tremendous growth, but this could be a problem for the banks,\" Shanahan said.\nLoans going bad are a bad sign for any business \u2014 never mind the broader economy \u2014 but the two banks did give a surefire indication that they are feeling confident about their prospects: they raised their dividend.\nNo major Canadian bank has missed a dividend payment in more than a century, but with a track record like that, banks are incredibly careful not to promise any more cash than they are confident they'll be able to come up with.\nCompanies that have to snatch back a dividend payment tend to be punished heavily on the stock market, so the banks have been raising their payouts steadily, but cautiously, for decades.\u00a0\nBased on Royal and CIBC\u00a0not increasing\u00a0their dividends during the previous quarter, Mendonca\u00a0was expecting both banks\u00a0to hike this time around. And that's exactly what they did \u2014 another three cents for Royal and four for CIBC.\u00a0\nHe's expecting a bump up at Scotiabank, too, but not for BMO since\u00a0that bank already hiked last quarter.\nBased on how much they are paying out, Shanahan\u00a0says the banks have some capacity to keep the dividend hikes coming, but on the whole he thought the\u00a0numbers at Royal and CIBC showed they are \"in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd as for the rest, \"I think results will continue to come in similarly,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": "Jon Hernandez", "title": "Persian community in B.C. calls for more pressure on Iranian government over human rights", "description": "Iranian-Canadians say unrest in their home country is causing hardships for citizens", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/persians-b-c-human-rights-iran-1.5420112", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5417185.1578416768!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1192031299.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 08, 2020 6:50 PM PT", "2020-01-09T02:50:23.992Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Despite living in Canada for nearly two decades, Kei Esmaeilpour\u00a0still has a lot of friends and family living in Iran.

And the tax advantage makes it even better.\nFor most Canadians who only own one home, Canadian tax law means that the entire eight-odd per cent increase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0about $40,000\u00a0on CREA's\u00a0average priced home and $80,000\u00a0on the average million-dollar homes of\u00a0Toronto and Vancouver \u2014 is entirely income-tax free.\nNot only that, but the CREA prediction for next year shows prices will rise another, tax free, 6.2 per cent.\u00a0What is not to like about such staggering returns?\nOver the longer term, Canadian property prices are in all likelihood a safe bet. While prices dip periodically, they almost always recover again. But that can take a decade or more.\nIn fact, a closer look at that 8.4 per cent rise in prices, according to CREA economist Gregory Klump, tells us that until just the last few months prices have not been doing so well. Effectively, the big percentage increase is based on comparing a high point in November this year with a low point in November a year ago.\nOverall, comparing all of 2018 to all of 2019 shows prices are only expected to rise 2.3 per cent by the time this year is over. So that is a detail to remind\u00a0you that it depends on exactly when you buy and when you sell. And not only when,\u00a0 but where.\n\"There was an almost even split between the number of local markets where activity rose and those where it declined,\" said the CREA report.\u00a0\"Higher sales across much of British Columbia and in the Greater Toronto Area\u00a0offset a decline in activity in Calgary.\"\nIf you are ever worried that you are feeling a bit too euphoric about the state of the property market and your enthusiasm needs damping down,\u00a0one useful option is to talk to Hilliard MacBeth, or better yet read his\u00a0book When the Bubble Bursts.\nThere aren't a lot of people who say\u00a0the Canadian housing market remains overvalued and is heading for an inevitable fall, but MacBeth is not the only one. Swiss bankers at UBS\u00a0recently put out their latest Global Real Estate Bubble Index, and Toronto had the honour of second place between Munich and Hong Kong. Vancouver came in at No.\u00a06.\n\"The people who are really suffering in the residential side are the new home builders who have built too much product on the outskirts of Edmonton and Calgary,\" said MacBeth,\u00a0on the phone from Edmonton at the end of last week. \"I think the term is 'immediate availability'\u00a0\u2014 code for 'we're desperate.'\"\nHe says there are bargains to be had, so long as you don't think prices\u00a0are going to go down further yet.\nAs MacBeth points out, under priced new-builds are not included in the CREA numbers, nor are mortgage defaults, which are often sold quietly by the foreclosing banks. He said that houses withdrawn from the market because the seller is dissatisfied by offer prices also don't make it into the data.\nIn some ways,\u00a0MacBeth says\u00a0the property market in\u00a0Alberta and Saskatchewan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0currently suffering from a continued downturn in the oil and gas sector\u00a0\u2014\u00a0represents a foretaste of what could happen if the wider Canadian economy were to go into recession.\nIt is something\u00a0Stephen Poloz\u00a0in his Bank of Canada year-end speech and news conference last week said he had taken into account. While the central bank\u00a0sees\u00a0the large pile of mortgage debt accumulated by Canadians as sustainable, it remains the principal vulnerability for Canada and its financial system.\n\"If a nasty shock came along and unemployment\u00a0in Canada rose significantly\u00a0\u2026 the effect of that shock would be magnified,\" Poloz told business reporters. \"So we would have a bigger and more prolonged recession than if that debt was not there.\"\nPoloz was in no way predicting a global or Canadian economy shock this coming year, but he said Bank of Canada modelling shows that even in the worst case, the country's banking system would remain sound.\nHaving studied the central bank's predictive scenarios,\u00a0MacBeth\u00a0is not so sure. But of course\u00a0gloom,\u00a0especially in the property market, is one of his specialities.\nHe is still advising young people to avoid the condo market where he thinks prices have become detached from the land value they represent. He is advising people to rent, and notes that construction companies working on purpose-built rental properties will continue to do well, selling them\u00a0to pension funds\u00a0for the reliable stream of future income they represent.\n\"So will 2020 be the year of recession in Canada? I suspect it will, and if that's the case, then it will be a particularly challenging time for Canadians because we've never gone into recession with\u00a0private-sector debt levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0both corporate and household\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at such high levels,\" said MacBeth.\nThat may be the minority view, but now you've been inoculated. It's safe to go back and read some\u00a0real estate optimism\u00a0about how property has nowhere to go but up in 2020.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Big families, small budgets: The challenge of housing for refugees", "description": "Valentina Cerka works to overcome barriers and find affordable housing for refugees in Winnipeg", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever/how-far-would-you-go-to-find-affordable-housing-1.5315055/big-families-small-budgets-the-challenge-of-housing-for-refugees-1.5326632", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5326658.1571430822!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/valentina-and-clients.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Oct 18, 2019 5:16 PM ET", "2019-10-24T20:25:03.327Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Valentina Cerka is on the phone, getting turned down, again.\nIt happens a lot.\u00a0\nToday, it's because the landlords she's speaking with don't want to rent a three bedroom unit to a family of seven from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"She asked me, 'How are you going to house seven people in a three bedroom?'\" said Cerka. \"[Because] we have to. We put three kids in one bedroom and we do bunk beds so they can sleep.\"\u00a0\nAs the housing coordinator for the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council (MIIC), Winnipeg's largest refugee settlement agency, it's her job to find affordable homes for refugees fleeing to Canada. That means Cerka has to overcome some significant barriers.\u00a0\nThe clock starts ticking the moment refugees land at the airport. Cerka has 14 calendar days to find them a place. That's how long people can stay in transitional housing at Welcome Place, run by MIIC.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"The most difficult part is the budget issue,\" said Cerka. \"The money they get,\u00a0it's not enough.\"\nCanadian Immigration and Citizenship provides funding for government sponsored refugees with money for rent. How much they get is determined by the size of the family and the age of the children.\u00a0\nThe family of seven, with two adults and five kids under 18, will receive $1,060 a month for rent and utilities. According to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average price of a three bedroom apartment in Winnipeg was $1,446 in 2018.\n\"I know those are the rates that are set, but they don't match reality,\" said Cerka.\u00a0\nCerka has learned to be a good negotiator. She is constantly asking landlords to lower the rent, to accommodate large families, and to rent to people who have no guarantor, no credit or rental history in Canada.\nShe knows that some landlords have strict regulations around siblings of different genders and different age groups sharing bedrooms. She doesn't call them if she is working with a large family, so Winnipeg's 2.9 per cent\u00a0vacancy rate shrinks even lower.\u00a0\nThen there are the bugs.\nCockroaches, bed bugs, mice infestations, Cerka sees them all in her search for affordable housing. She works with landlords to deal with these problems before she lets families sign leases.\n\"I ask myself,\u00a0'Can I live there with my son?'\" said Cerka. \"If my family can't live there, why can they?\"\u00a0\nCerka identifies with her clients because she arrived in Canada as a refugee herself. She fled Albania for Yugoslavia, where she lived in a refugee camp and gave birth to her son. Then war broke out and she fled again, this time arriving in Winnipeg in 1993 with her seven-month-old baby.\n\"I didn't have to suffer that much because the rental rates were not this high,\" said Cerka. She took the first apartment settlement workers showed her. They moved to a cheaper place the following year while she went to school and worked.\u00a0\nAfter becoming a single mother in 1997, Cerka worked four jobs in order to buy a small house. She remembers carrying her sleeping child to the car at 3 a.m. so she could deliver newspapers before starting her day job at Welcome Place. Evenings and weekends were spent working as a waitress.\nCerka cries every time she tells her story. She feels guilty for not spending more time with her son when he was young. It's something they've talked about.\n\"I said, 'I hope you don't hate me, and I hope you realize that what I did, I did it for you because [the] home we have, it's going to be yours.'\" said Cerka. Her son reassured her that he is grateful for all of her sacrifices.\nBack in her office,\u00a0Cerka congratulates two clients, brothers, who are moving into a two bedroom unit on the upper floor of a duplex. If they pool their rent money, $695 each, they can afford the $900 rent and utilities.\u00a0\n\"They're happy! They like it,\" said Cerka. \"They're moving before the 14 days, so that's perfect.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nCerka and her staff have found housing for 180 people so far this year, including 59 families. Cerka celebrates each success.\n\"Looking at these people it's like I'm looking at myself, what I was when I came here,\" said Cerka. \"l needed this help, and these people need this help, so I have to do it. It's a responsibility.\"\nThen she picks up the phone again, still on the search for a place for the family of seven\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the ones who will arrive after them.\n"}, {"author": "Hadani Ditmars", "title": "Social distancing is important.

In a high-density city like Vancouver, this feels like too little, too late.\u00a0\nHow do residents of the 58 per cent of dwellings in Vancouver that are apartments \"self-isolate\" when they have shared spaces such as\u00a0laundry rooms, elevators, stairwells and lobbies to contend with?\nFor those living in detached houses, self-isolation is much easier than for those in towers, and yet according to the\u00a02016 census, 33.5 per cent of Canadians live in multi-family dwellings. In Toronto's census metropolitan area,\u00a0nearly three\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0dwellings are in highrise apartment buildings, and\u00a0in Vancouver towers make up 16.7 percent of housing.\nIn my own rental apartment tower in Kitsilano, a neighbour in her 60s informed me by email that she was returning from two months\u00a0in California and would self-isolate across the hall from me.\nWhile I was grateful for my neighbour's disclosure, I was alarmed at the lack of protocols on multi-family residences from my landlord, the Residential Tenancy Board\u00a0or Vancouver Coastal Health. I live in an old building with shared facilities, such as heating and ventilation, and\u00a0many aging and vulnerable tenants.\nThe only reason I know my neighbour is returning from the U.S. is because she informed me, but I have no idea how many other tenants in my building are also returning from abroad and if they are voluntarily self-isolating. I have no idea if anyone in my building has tested positive or what the protocol would be if they did.\nOur landlord has only very recently put up posters in common areas with some basic advice, suggesting social distancing and \"limited time spent in the laundry room.\"\nNo additional cleaning protocols are in evidence and visitors \u2014 overnight and otherwise \u2014 are allowed, as are visits by maintenance staff who work in dozens of other buildings, and couriers and postal workers who deliver to individual suites.\nIn many places battling COVID-19, apartment towers can become potential breeding grounds for community spread if proper protocols are not followed.\nIn Hong Kong last month, for instance,\u00a0officials quarantined dozens of residents living in an apartment tower where a woman who lived 10 floors below a resident with the virus also tested positive and was found to have an unsealed ventilation pipe in her apartment.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant to write an opinion for CBC British Columbia? Please email bcvoices@cbc.ca.\nI'm 22, chronically ill \u2014 and feel dismissed in the COVID-19 dialogue\nJoseph G. Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in the New York Times that\u00a0buildings of all kinds \"are highly efficient at spreading disease,\"\u00a0but proper ventilation, filtration, diligent cleaning of common areas and adequate levels of humidity can help mitigate community spread.\u00a0\nIn New York City,\u00a0the health department is developing more extensive guidance for property owners and managers, and advising them to clean more often and use disinfectant products.\nIn Canada, this doesn't seem to be a priority.\nWhen I rang my landlord for more information after the province's announcement, he said they were waiting on a directive from the Residential Tenancy Branch, but told me that they could not reveal if there were any tenants in buildings who had COVID-19 or who had recently returned from abroad or\u00a0whether they were\u00a0self-quarantining, because of privacy concerns.\u00a0\nMoreover, in cities like Vancouver and Toronto with sky-high real estate prices and low vacancy rates, many people are forced into \"co-housing\" situations that make self-isolation virtually impossible.\nOn a popular Facebook group called COVID-19 Coming Together (Vancouver), a young woman sharing a condo with eight others\u00a0asked\u00a0whether it was still OK\u00a0to have friends and lovers stay overnight\u00a0during the pandemic.\nAnother plea came from a\u00a0woman whose roommate was returning from a band tour in the U.S. and refused to practise basic self-isolation protocol. The two share a bathroom and kitchen in a small basement apartment in a complex.\nThe issue also affects condo owners who rub elbows, as it were, in lobbies, elevators and even gyms (an alarming number remain open, even as public ones close.)\nCurrent public health guidelines around COVID-19 would seem out of step with Canada's new urban, high-density reality.\u00a0\nIf all levels of government continue to make protocols to mitigate community spread in multi-family residences a low priority, leave it in the hands of landlords\u00a0or simply pass the buck, they do so at our increasing peril.\nWant to write an opinion or point of view piece for CBC British Columbia?

"2019-06-09T08:00:00.494Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Khatija Ali did not plan on becoming an urban housing pioneer.\nThe 28-year-old Toronto native graduated with a medical degree from the University of Windsor in April 2018. A few months later, she moved to New York City to launch her biotech startup and needed a place to live.\nShe was struck by the first place she saw: a two-bedroom, tastefully furnished apartment with exposed brick and expensive appliances in a townhouse located in the rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bushwick.\n\"We actually fell in love with it. It was the first apartment we saw\u00a0and we basically just moved in,\" Ali told The Sunday Edition.\nWhile the unit was enough to convince Ali this was the place she wanted to live, she soon discovered this was no ordinary apartment building.\nThe building was owned and managed by a company called Node,\u00a0one of about a dozen companies that, over the past few years,\u00a0have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to upend the rental market in our largest and priciest cities with an approach called co-living.\nThere are many variations of co-living,\u00a0but it's best to think of a typical co-living building as a combination of apartment, college dorm, hotel\u00a0and high-end rooming house\u00a0\u2014 like a 1970s commune without the communitarian ideology.\nCo-founded by Canadian entrepreneur Anil Khera, Node currently owns\u00a0buildings in New York, Dublin, London\u00a0and Los Angeles.\nThey've also\u00a0purchased a building in the Ontario tech hub of Kitchener-Waterloo, with plans to open their first Canadian co-living building by the end of next year, before expanding across the country.\nAli's building in Bushwick has eight units, with 14 people currently living here.\n\"There's some people who live upstairs who are hairdressers.\u00a0And then we're here. And then\u00a0we have someone who's an artist.\u00a0And the couple next door \u2014 they travel a lot,\" said Ali. \"So it's a lot of different people, with a lot of different backgrounds, and that's really appealing in itself.\"\nOther co-living buildings are much larger, housing hundreds of people. But what they all have in common is density.\nMost co-living apartments are small, even by New York standards. Some are only a few hundred square feet and have shared bathrooms and kitchens. By squeezing more rental units into their buildings, these companies hope to make them more affordable for people who might otherwise be priced out of desirable neighbourhoods like Bushwick.\nThat hasn't really happened yet \u2014 at least not in Brooklyn. Ali's two bedroom rents for $2,800 US a month, which is\u00a0similar to what a traditional\u00a0apartment would cost in Bushwick. But when all the extras are factored in, co-living can become\u00a0a\u00a0more attractive proposition.\nIn exchange for less private space, co-living buildings offer generous common spaces, like lounges, gyms\u00a0and hot tubs, as well as hotel-style amenities, including free Wi-Fi, utilities and housekeeping.\nCo-living companies also often hire a representative \u2014 known as a \"community curator\" in the case of Node \u2014\u00a0who act as a sort of concierge, helping to manage the building, deal with residents' problems and organize community-building activities, from music nights to local bar tours.\nThe current target market for co-living is millennials \u2014 generally defined as people born between 1981 and 1996 \u2014 who are increasingly finding themselves shut out of the rental market in the major global cities where so many want to work and live.\nThanks to social media, they're connected to more people than any previous generation, but they're also feeling lonelier and more isolated. The promise that virtual communities can be as meaningful as genuine communities is starting to fade, according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University.\n\"Many people now recognize that being on the screen all the time is unsatisfying,\" he said. \"And many of us really hunger for connections where we live.\u00a0And that can be the neighbourhood, that can be the block\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it could also be the very building\u00a0you spend time.\"\nKhera\u00a0currently divides his time between London, where Node is based, and Toronto, where he grew up. He said his previous experience working at a private equity real estate investment firm propelled him to find new models for building community through the housing market.\n\"I understood the broken nature of the housing market from a professional standpoint, but also from a human standpoint,\" said Khera.\n\"We're building cities with fractured relationships between residents living all on top of each other. We really haven't addressed housing and the right way for actually thinking about what's good for society. And so all co-living operators believe that there's a better way to connect to people and have community.\"\nFor people like Ali, new to the city and busy running her business, these efforts to build a community among her fellow millennial co-livers was as appealing as the appliances and exposed brick.\n\"I didn't know anyone here in New York\u00a0and it was really nice to come into a community that you could connect with people who are on the same level,\" she said. \"New York is built for a certain type of fast-paced individual, anybody with an entrepreneurial type of spirit, anybody that wants to be their own person\u00a0\u2014 and I think I fit right in.\"\nThe appeal of co-living for young professionals is pretty clear. Selling the idea to investors has been a harder slog. Executives at one co-living company, Ollie, approached 400 New York building owners before one agreed to allow them to convert a conventional apartment building into co-living units.\nBut that reluctance has now largely dissipated. Money is pouring in and plans are underway to move co-living beyond its millennial roots.\nEarlier this year, Common, a large co-living company, announced a partnership with one of New York's biggest developers to form a new venture called Kin. The plan is to create co-living spaces designed to meet the needs of young families. There will\u00a0be small,\u00a0self-contained apartments and lots of shared spaces, including playrooms, places to park strollers\u00a0and other community areas for children and their caregivers.\nCo-living is also a model that could one day appeal to Gen-Xers and baby boomers, and, according to Khera, that's already starting to happen.\n\"We get quite a few of our residents' parents saying, 'Where's my Node?'\" he said.\nWritten and produced by Ira Basen\n"}, {"author": "Ross Marowits", "title": "Homebuyers escape high housing costs by relocating to secondary cities",

international student enrolment, says the property will be used for future development, but no details are available because the deal won't be finalized until early November.\nThe facility closed in 2006, but horse owners still board some animals in the barns and use the track for training. There's no word on when they might have to be out of the barns and off the track.\nThe owner of Tartan Downs, Jack MacNeil, declined to comment until the sale is finalized.\nThe track opened in 1899 on what was then the outskirts of the city, but housing has long since grown in around the property.\nGreg Sparling, a longtime harness racer, said the track used to be a busy spot.\n\"Aw, it was the best place,\" he said. \"We used to race Monday, Thursday and Saturday, earlier on, and it was an all-season surface. We could race both winter and summer.\"\nIn its heyday, the track was popular with horse owners, drivers and spectators.\n\"The steel plant was going strong, the fishery, the mines, and there was no lotto machines,\" said Sparling.\n\"Well, we had bingo was our only competition, put it that way. No local casino at the time. It was very popular with the miners, fishermen, and generally the local people had a place to go. Fun place to be.\"\nSparling said competition from casinos, video lottery terminals and televised racing helped put the track out of business.\n\"People found other places to put their money,\" he said.\nIn addition, the closure of Cape Breton's steel plant and coal mines hurt the economy and reduced people's disposable income, Sparling said.\nSparling said the track itself was built using slag material from the steel plant, which made it excellent for horses and drivers. The infield, he said, is literally a burial ground for horses that died or had to be put down.\nThe track had a series of owners over the decades. MacNeil\u00a0purchased it out of receivership in 1995.\nCape Breton University has been bursting at the seams over the last year or so with a huge increase in\u00a0international student enrolment.\nAccording to Viewpoint Realty, the Tartan Downs property includes four parcels of land and covers nearly 10 hectares just off Upper Prince Street.\nIt is zoned for multiple uses, including some manufacturing, retail, recreation and residential housing.\nA decade ago, just after racing was shut down for good, the property's assessed value for taxation was $266,300.\nThis year, it's assessed at $88,900 and the listed sale price was $259,500.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Immigrants less likely to own single-detached houses, StatsCan report finds", "description": "In Vancouver, however, immigrant-owned detached homes are worth an average $255K more", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/immigrant-ownership-residential-properties-toronto-vancouver-1.5170525", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2569999.1394648571!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/van-real-estate-20100408-topix.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 11, 2019 6:41 PM ET", "2019-06-11T22:41:13.766Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Immigrants own proportionally fewer single-detached homes than Canadian-born residents, a new report has found, but in Vancouver, the ones they do own likely come with a higher sticker price.\nA Statistics Canada study published Tuesday explores the degree to which immigrants are integrated into different segments of the housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver.\nIt found that immigrants own 43 per cent of all residential properties in Toronto and 37 per cent in Vancouver.\u00a0\nThe study examined only properties owned by people who live in Canada, therefore excluding foreign-owned properties. It used assessed property values from 2016 in Toronto and 2017\u00a0in Vancouver.\nOf the homes\u00a0owned by immigrants in Vancouver, 39 per cent are single-detached houses, compared to 48 per cent for Canadian-born residents.\nYet in Vancouver, those immigrant-owned detached properties had an average assessed value of $1.8 million\u2014\u00a0$255,100 more than the average value of detached homes owned by Canadian residents.\nIn Toronto, the report found the picture was a bit different: About half of properties owned by immigrants were single-detached houses, compared to 60 per cent of homes owned by Canadian-born residents.\u00a0\nThe report found only a slim margin of difference in assessed property values of the homes owned by the two groups. In this case, the detached properties of Canadian-born residents were worth about $20,000 more than those owned by immigrants.\nHome value varied more when the programs that brought the immigrant homeowners to Canada were taken into account.\nRecent immigrants are defined in this report as those who immigrated to Canada between 2009 and\u00a02016. People in this group own five per cent of all single-detached homes in the Vancouver area, with an average assessed value of $2.3 million. That's $823,900 higher than the average for Canadian-born owners of detached\u00a0houses.\nDrilling down further still, those who arrived in Canada as recent investor immigrants own more expensive Vancouver properties than those in all other immigration programs.\nIt's no surprise that the investor immigrants have\u00a0more money to spend on housing, said\u00a0Hilliard MacBeth, an Edmonton-based financial adviser and author of When the Bubble Bursts: Surviving the Canadian Real Estate Crash.\n\"The general idea is that you have to have some money and you have to have some kind of economic contribution. Obviously, those people have a lot more money than the average Canada,\" he said.\nRecent investor immigrants to Toronto also own more expensive detached homes than those who arrived through other programs. However,\u00a0the difference in assessed value between recent investor immigrants to Toronto compared to their Canadian-born Toronto neighbours is less pronounced.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605548099627", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605148739589", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Michelle Ghoussoub", "title": "Influx of 4,500 workers raises fears of violence against women in B.C.'s northwest", "description": "Women's shelters in Kitimat, Terrace already operate above capacity while concerns about 'man camps' persist  ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/violence-against-women-bc-1.5486095", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5486164.1583361944!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jessica-mccallum-miller.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 06, 2020 2:00 AM PT", "2020-03-06T17:25:21.109Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "This story is part of Stopping Domestic Violence, a CBC News series looking at the crisis of intimate partner violence in Canada and what can be done to end it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nKitimat, B.C., feels like a town of men.\nIn fast food joints and corporate buses shuttling workers around the North Coast town, employees of the LNG Canada project stand out with their uniformity. Most sport\u00a0the obligatory\u00a0heavy duty boots and coats worn by\u00a0workers throughout\u00a0B.C.'s\u00a0north as they cope with a waning winter.\nThe $40-billion liquefied\u00a0natural gas project\u00a0will employ about\u00a07,000 workers\u00a0at the peak of construction,\u00a0flying 4,500 people into town for rotating two-week shifts. Around 80 per cent of workers are men, swelling the size of Kitimat, whose population is normally just over 8,000.\nThe influx of people into town has\u00a0mixed consequences, providing a boon to local businesses\u00a0and raising environmental questions. But there's\u00a0another, more worrying, trend. Over the past two years, Kitimat and nearby Terrace's shelters for women fleeing violence have frequently been overwhelmed while concerns about harassment from incoming workers grows.\n\"We have been at or over capacity most nights of the year for the past two or three years,\" said Michelle Martin, who works at the Tamitik Status of Women.\nJessica McCallum-Miller, Terrace's 26-year-old, first Indigenous city councillor, says she's worried the influx of people into town is also\u00a0increasing instances of violence outside of intimate relationships.\nShe says she's felt threatened by\u00a0men who are strangers.\n\"As a young Indigenous woman, I'm actually facing some stalking, violence in my community, I've been harassed by unknown men, not from this community,\" she said, adding she and others have\u00a0been followed by men in cars.\n\"I don't know if they work for industry, I don't know who they are,\" she said, her shock of blue hair in contrast to Terrace city council's stark chambers.\u00a0\nLNG Canada has brought prosperity to the town which has already experienced several cycles of boom and bust that accompany natural resource projects. Martin says the project has also \"unintentionally affected\" women fleeing violence by driving up the price of housing. Other community\u00a0members say the project has sparked fears that \"man camps\" \u2014\u00a0temporary housing for predominantly male workers \u2014\u00a0will make the area dangerous for women.\nLNG Canada says it\u00a0knows major natural resource projects can put a strain on small towns, and that it takes the safety of women and Indigenous people seriously.\u00a0Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada's director of corporate affairs, says it's not true that workers pose a threat to women.\n\"The view that these are just cauldrons of testosterone and these men are out to get the women is wrong,\" she said.\nKitimat is a hilly cluster of faded pastel homes and newer, low-rise apartments tucked at the head of B.C.'s Douglas Channel, in the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. In late February, the snow banks are several feet high and covered in a layer of winter grime.\nA public work road snakes out of town toward the project site, past a dozen orange hydraulic cranes known as cherry pickers, and a collection\u00a0of blue and white temporary housing units where workers will live come April.\u00a0\nSomewhere in town, at a secret location, is Kitimat's women's shelter. It's funded for eight beds but squeezes in a ninth, and is officially over capacity when that last bed is full. The shelter has had to turn\u00a0away dozens of women and their children over the past two years.\nIts director Martin says that's an alarming number, considering many women facing\u00a0abuse from a partner can't or don't leave, immediately or ever.\n\"There's this assumption that when violence occurs people want the relationship to stop or want to leave when in fact, more often than not, women want the relationship to continue \u2014\u00a0they want the violence, the behaviour, the abuse to end,\" she said, adding it's even less likely women will leave in a town as small as Kitimat, where it's near impossible to stay anonymous.\nLeah Levac, an associate professor at\u00a0the University of Guelph who studies the experiences of women in towns hosting natural resource projects, says research shows domestic violence rates in the north are \"related to resource\u00a0extraction.\"\nShe said locals who can't work in industry\u00a0come under pressure when workers with higher incomes flood the town, driving up the cost of housing. While nationally the average median total income for women is about 68 per cent of that earned by men, in Kitimat it's 49 per cent, making it difficult for women to strike out on their own.\nMartin said natural resource project work is inherently precarious, and those who do land jobs suffer mentally when projects wrap up.\n\"For somebody who has low coping mechanisms or emotional regulation, if they feel bad about themselves and see others prospering, certainly that can translate to violence,\" she said.\nDomestic violence is one, but not the only, concern. The National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women's report released in June 2019 explicitly warned \"increased crime levels, including drug- and alcohol-related offences, sexual offences, and domestic and 'gang' violence, have been linked to 'boom town' and other resource development contexts,\" and urged companies to consider the safety of Indigenous women in all stages of project planning.\nLNG Canada said it's working to mitigate impacts on Kitimat by housing workers at a camp \u2014\u00a0referred to as the lodge\u00a0\u2014\u00a0near its work site outside of town. It was also the first company to undergo, as part of its environmental assessment, another process examining social impacts on the community.\nCompany spokesperson Pierce says there's a zero-tolerance policy for violence, harassment, and bullying both \"inside and outside the fence,\" in reference to behaviour both on and off the work site.\n\"The view that you have all these men sort of coming in to huddle together and [do] bad things, I think that's a misconception. The kinds of folks that come in to work on these jobs, they have families too, and daughters too,\" she said.\nStill, in a small town where the ratio of women to men is warped, it can be difficult to dispel a sense of unease.\n\"When we speak with both Haisla and settler women in this community, they will flag that their perception of increased instances of feeling unsafe [...] are connected to this influx of people,\" said Levac, who has travelled to Kitimat several times to interview women.\nBefore running for city councillor, McCallum-Miller worked in the donation room of Terrace's shelter for women. Still in her early 20s and not formally trained as a social worker, she'd often find herself counselling women fleeing violence, as the shelter struggled to keep up with the demand for services.\u00a0\nIt's a memory she's carried with her as she ran for office, and as she\u00a0reads about how projects have put pressure on other towns.\n\"I know that there's domestic violence, I know that there's sexual violence and I know that we're being extremely impacted by this, especially Indigenous women. And a lot of time it's swept under the rug,\" she said.\nDespite her reservations, McCallum-Miller says she's still undecided about how the project will affect her community. Kitimat and Terrace have already been through multiple cycles of boom or bust, and longtime residents know other hardships come when well-paying jobs dry up.\nPierce's voice swells over the phone as\u00a0she emphasizes that she wants Kitimat's experience with LNG Canada to be different.\n\"We want people to be safe. We want women to be safe. And Indigenous people to be safe,\" she said.\nIf you need help and are in immediate danger, call 911.

Well, with respect, a walk through those projects and that significant spending says, 'No, no, you are not doing everything you can.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNB Power spokesperson Marc Belliveau said prices for homes in the new development are not yet set, but, if spending is approved by the EUB, the utility is hoping they will be accessible to multiple income groups\n\"Our expectation from discussions with our homebuilding partners is that these homes will be priced to make them as affordable to as many folks as possible,\" Belliveau said in an email.\nSingle-family homes in Moncton's Halls Creek area are assessed and/or have recently sold for between $250,000 and $400,000, similar to houses in the small \"net zero ready\" development at Dobson Landing in Riverview.\n"}, {"author": "Craig Desson", "title": "How Montreal's Habitat 67 is inspiring a new generation of apartments in Asia", "description": "52 years ago, Habitat heralded a new way to build urban housing.\u00a0The style is now catching on internationally", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/moshe-safdie-habitat-67-montreal-asia-1.5237223", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5250515.1565988938!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada-150-stamp-20170427.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 02, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-02T08:00:00.876Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Habitat 67, a seemingly bizarre and innovative collection of modular apartments overlooking the St. Lawrence River, has been around for more than 50 years. Moshe Safdie still can't believe it exists.\n\"It's like a fairy tale. How did I ever get it built?\" said Safdie, 81. The Israeli-Canadian architect designed the project, and was in his 20s when it opened in 1967.\nBuilt for Expo 67 in Montreal's Cit\u00e9 du Havre neighbourhood, not far from the Old Port, its cubist design, floor-to-ceiling windows and rooftop gardens were heralded as a new way to build urban housing.\u00a0\n\"The objective was to rethink the apartment building,\" said Safdie.\u00a0\u00a0\nHabitat turned Safdie into an overnight success. He made the cover of Newsweek \u2014 a photo of him and his chef-d'oeuvre appeared below a headline that read: \"The shape of things to come.\"\nThere were plans to build similar buildings in New York City, Jerusalem and Puerto Rico, but they were never built, mostly because of the cost.\u00a0Habitat\u00a0was\u00a0built as a one-off\u00a0for Expo 67 with government money, unlike regular apartment towers which\u00a0are usually paid for by private investors looking to turn a profit.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, five decades later,\u00a0Safdie is building\u00a0versions of his iconic buildings once again \u2014 in Asia.\u00a0\nHans Ibelings, an architecture historian at the University of Toronto, said it's not unusual for ideas in architecture to take decades to take hold.\u00a0\n\"I believe that when something is new in architecture, it's seen as a novelty,\" he explained.\n\"When it's 30, 40 years old, and if it managed to survive \u2026 then it can become a classic and you can see this clearly with Habitat.\"\nTo understand why the Habitat style is experiencing a renaissance,\u00a0it's worth looking at what made it a unique\u00a0building in the first place.\nSafdie's\u00a0breakthrough was that he realized by adding large terraces and wide laneways between units, an apartment complex could feel like a neighbourhood in the suburbs.\u00a0\nHabitat 67 showed that high-density urban housing\u00a0could be built without making people feel like they've been crammed into a concrete shoebox.\u00a0\n\"Habitat tries to give to the individual \u2026\u00a0what he wants in a suburb, but goes a step further and gives them the positive things a city has to offer,\" Safdie told CBC Television in 1966.\nHabitat cost about $17 million to build, which today\u00a0works out to $128 million \u2014 a high price tag for an apartment building with 158 units.\u00a0\nA reason for the cost was that Safdie didn't just want to build his iconic modular units. He wanted to create a factory to build them in.\nHowever, according to Avi Friedman, a professor of architecture at McGill University, the money needed to create his apartment factory never materialized.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe says while there are examples of prefabricated buildings\u00a0made out other materials such as wood, the investment needed concrete building factory is enormous.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We are talking about many millions, perhaps tens of millions,\"\u00a0said Friedman.\u00a0\nAnd, he added, real estate development is cyclical, so it's unlikely there would ever be enough orders to make a concrete apartment factory profitable.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter Habitat 67,\u00a0Safdie built other types of buildings.\u00a0He created\u00a0the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Terminal 1 at Toronto's Pearson International Airport and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum in Jerusalem.\u00a0\n\"He moved into a completely different direction,\" said Ibelings.\nWhile Safdie did build a few Habitat-inspired buildings, such as Boston's Esplanade Condominiums, they didn't come close to the grand scale he had envisioned.\nBut in recent years,\u00a0Asia's growing cities have created a demand for\u00a0Safdie's\u00a0design.\nHis reputation for building high-density housing with large balconies, shared gardens and open spaces\u00a0is resonating with Asian real estate developers looking to create something other than a regular apartment tower.\u00a0\nSome Asian developers are approaching\u00a0Safdie's architecture firm\u00a0because they're fans of his style.\u00a0In other cases, Safdie's firm will submit a proposal for a Habitat-style building that fits with\u00a0a developer's call for pitches.\n\"The increased density of today's cities requires us to rethink building types to maintain a sense of community,\" said Safdie.\nThen in Singapore, there's Sky Habitat. The building is a 38-storey apartment complex with similar large balconies and\u00a0outdoor terraces.\u00a0\nIn Colombo, Safdie has designed what will be the largest residential building in Sri Lanka. Its leaning tower will give apartments a terrace with a view of the sky above.\u00a0\nSafdie is happy to finally see his vision spread internationally. But even with the proliferation of Habitat-style buildings\u00a0on the other side of the world, he still has a soft spot for the one that started it all.\n\"It's still the most radical building I ever built, and that's after 55 years of practising architecture,\" he said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "New mortgage loans slowed in Canada but overall value is still rising, says CMHC", "description": "The average value of a\u00a0mortgage reached $209,570, which is\u00a0more than 3% higher than a year ago", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mortgage-debt-loans-cmhc-1.5144773", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4855461.1560521865!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cmhc-20180731.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 22, 2019 12:49 PM ET", "2019-05-22T16:49:51.221Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The number of mortgage loans in Canada grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter as housing activity cooled, according to a new report from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, but the value of all mortgages is still rising.\nThere were 223,000 new mortgage loans in the last three months of 2018, which is 4.8 per cent lower than the same period a year ago, the CMHC said.\n\"While indebtedness of Canadian households remains elevated, growth in the volume of mortgage activity slowed in the last quarter of 2018, partly reflecting lower housing market activity,\" said\u00a0Genevi\u00e8ve Lapointe, senior market analyst at CHMC in the report.\n\"Despite high debt levels, delinquency rates remain low and the number of highly indebted and more vulnerable consumers has decreased.\"\nBorrowers with a low credit score accounted for less than one per cent of new mortgage loans, the CMHC said.\nBut, even as\u00a0the number of loans fell, the average value of all\u00a0mortgages in Canada reached $209,570 in the fourth quarter, which is\u00a0more than three percent higher than a year ago.\nThe CMHC said the national trends mirror what happened\u00a0in Toronto and Vancouver\u00a0\u2014 the country's largest and most expensive housing markets.\nWhile the number of transactions for home sales fell last year on higher borrowing costs, slower economic growth and recent mortgage regulations, the average house price in Canada is still \"historically elevated,\" the CMHC said.\n\"This explains, in part, why the average balance of new loans remains higher than in the overall mortgage market.\"\nMortgages accounted for about two-thirds of all debt held by Canadians, according to the government agency.\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned policymakers in Canada not to ease mortgage stress test rules introduced last year, because household debt remains high.\nAdded to that, the CMHC said household debt rose faster than income last year\u00a0\u2014 leading\u00a0the debt-to-income ratio to hit\u00a0a record high of 178.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.\u00a0\nA big driver of this was Canadians with mortgages taking on more debt, the CMHC said.\n\"Their average outstanding balance in credit cards and lines of credit\u00a0grew at a faster pace than in 2017, except for HELOCs\u00a0(home equity line of credit) and auto loans, which increased at a slightly slower pace,\" the report said.\n\"These trends were also observed among\u00a0consumers without a mortgage.\"\nCanadians\u00a0with a mortgage had an average balance of $9,054 in\u00a0other debt, which rose 3.6 per cent from the same period in 2017.

Four per cent were youth.\u00a0\nAccording to the data collected, 80\u00a0per cent of those people were on Ontario Works or Ontario disability.\u00a0\nLady Laforet, executive director of the Welcome Centre Shelter for Women\u00a0said the homelessness numbers have a lot to do with affordability and availability.\n\"You're looking at needing first, last, deposits, a police clearance ... a lot of the women we serve don't meet a lot of those demands,\" said Laforet. \"Then landlords don't tend to choose women or families who are on Ontario Works.\"\nLaforet said income support rates haven't changed in \"decades\" but the cost of living has.\n\"If you are to get into a rental that isn't feasible long-term, the movement into another unit you can't afford is next to impossible.\"\nAccording to Laforet, it's a \"landlord's game\" and competition has increased, with\u00a0some landlords are only looking to rent to students, rather than adult women.\u00a0\nJoyce Zuk,\u00a0executive director of Family Services Windsor Essex, said it makes sense that as space tightens up across the board, women will be affected too.\u00a0\n\"It's a trend that we're going to continue to see,\" said Zuk. \"It goes hand in hand with the fact that we're seeing families needing to access shelter too.\"\nZuk said the problem isn't unique to Windsor-Essex, but exists across the country.\u00a0\n\"We're seeing the price of housing going up,\" said Zuk. \"Historically, our community has been one of the most affordable places to live. That has significantly changed.\"\nAccording to Zuk, in the past a friend may have been more likely to let a woman crash on their couch, but that's changed.\n\"What we really need is to see a significant investment and build in housing,\" said Zuk. \"It's not going to happen overnight.\"\nThe typical recipient of Ontario Disability receives about $600 \u2014 finding affordable housing at that rate is a \"hard issue\" said Zuk.\u00a0\n\"Sometimes you end up with this gap, where there is nothing in between,\" said Laforet. At the Welcome Centre, the length of time someone can stay varies depending on each individual's circumstances.\u00a0\nLaforet said typically what you're dealing with is a woman or a family \"not unlike the one you're standing behind at the grocery store.\"\n\"They want to find a place to feel safe,to call home,\" said Laforet, adding that the people the Welcome Centre sees aren't necessarily those with addiction or mental health problems.\n\"At the end of the day, it comes down to a housing issue.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/655695939610", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/757254723778", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/653402691923", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/660477507969", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/655416899918", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Millennium Library critics don't want recommended security changes lost in 'disappointing' city budget", "description": "Expenditure targets will hold community services to 0.5% increase, won't meet cost of inflation", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/millennium-library-critics-winnipeg-budget-targets-disappointing-1.5353831", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5162102.1568041820!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-millennium-library-security.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 09, 2019 6:00 AM CT", "2019-11-09T12:00:00.767Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A group of people who have publicly criticized the airport-like security measures at Winnipeg's Millennium Library are hoping to hold the city to recommendations its community services committee made in September.\nSarah Broad, a spokesperson for Millennium for All, said the group is worried the expenditure targets for the next four years released by the City of Winnipeg\u00a0last month don't include funds to cover recommended additions at the library.\nAt its September meeting, the community services\u00a0committee recommended measures including non-violent crisis intervention training, a cultural provider, a new community connections space and two more crisis workers to enhance safety at the library.\n\"We'd really like to see some strong leadership out of city hall, since it's been two months since that\u00a0meeting,\" Broad said this week.\nThe city unveiled the broad strokes of its first four-year budget planning process on Oct. 18.\nThe city's planned expenditure targets for 2020-23 would hold community services to a slim 0.5 per cent increase per year \u2014 which Broad said won't bring the department anywhere near the almost $570,000 needed in next year's budget to meet the committee's library safety recommendations.\n\"It's really disappointing at this point. We're really concerned that a 0.5 per cent increase doesn't even cover the cost of inflation \u2014 never mind trying to also cover extra staffing and training for staff at the library, and an exit plan for these [existing] security measures,\" said Broad.\nThe new\u00a0measures, which the library said were\u00a0implemented earlier this year to address\u00a0an increase in the number and severity of security incidents, include\u00a0bag checks and hand-held metal detection screening.\nA spokesperson for the City of Winnipeg said in an email that the city's multi-year budget process is underway, but did not say whether the library recommendations are on the table for next year's budget.\nThe community service committee's budget presentation is scheduled for Nov. 16 at 9:30 a.m., the city's website says.\nBroad said it's important to protect\u00a0libraries, especially as\u00a0barrier-free community spaces seem to be in short supply.\n\"There are people for whom the library is a place of safety,\" she said. \"And that is a really, really important thing. We're running out of those places. We're running out of places where you can just go and simply exist.\"\nOn Saturday, the group will take its concerns to a community engagement event hosted by Fort Rouge-East Fort Garry Coun. Sherri Rollins to discuss housing and community services.\n\"We're hoping to see some movement and some action,\" said Broad.\u00a0\n\"We really care about community safety for everyone, and that includes the people who, right now, are not able to get into the library, or at least don't feel like they are able to go to the library.\"\nThe town hall will be held at 12:30 p.m.\u00a0Saturday at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/759161411693", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source":

lawsuit over the tax to reach the courts.\nIn a lawsuit filed Thursday, the homeowners\u00a0claim the speculation tax unfairly targets residents and out-of-country Canadians who split their time between two homes \u2014 many of them retirees with limited income, who are house rich but cash poor.\nThe civil action alleges the levy\u00a0is unconstitutional, infringes on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and is beyond the power of the provincial government.\nIt seeks\u00a0an injunction to stop the province from imposing the tax.\u00a0\nThe lead plaintiffs in the case are an elderly couple from Oak Bay near Victoria \u2014\u00a0Denise Pettersson Simpson, 72, a Canadian citizen, and her husband\u00a0Robert Simpson, 93, a U.S. war veteran who received a Purple Heart after\u00a0being injured in the line of duty.\nThey spend part of the year in Texas, where Robert gets medical care covered by his U.S. military service, and part of the year in the B.C. family home where Denise grew up.\n\"I love this house and I don't want to lose it,\" says Denise Simpson. \"I'm a Canadian. It doesn't make any sense to me.\"\nThe seniors say they can't hold on to their $1.2 million\u00a0home because they can't pay the $6,000 annual\u00a0speculation\u00a0tax they've been assessed on top of other taxes.\nThe two-storey yellow wood frame home has been in Denise's family since 1952, when she was five.\nBut the province has ruled the house isn't their primary residence and isn't rented out to \"non-family members\" \u2014 so it is ineligible for exemption.\n\"I couldn't believe it. I couldn't understand how this could apply to us,\" says Denise Simpson. \"We didn't buy the house, we inherited it. We're not speculators.\"\nThe B.C. government imposed the speculation tax in November 2018, saying it was designed to target foreign and domestic real estate speculators, turn empty homes into affordable housing, and generate tax revenue to be used for housing initiatives.\nRich offshore investors have been blamed for driving up market prices \u2014 buying homes and condos for investment purposes, often leaving them empty.\nThe Simpsons allege they've fallen victim to an overly broad tax.\nThey say they've repeatedly declined purchase offers from speculators, and recently paid off the Oak Bay mortgage so Denise could move back to Canada permanently after Robert dies.\nNow they face an uncertain future.\n\"We were in the act of settling in when this hit,\" says Robert Simpson.\u00a0\"[We're]\u00a0surprised the government greed for money could drive us out of here.\"\nIn July, the B.C. government revealed the speculation tax is expected to put $115 million into provincial coffers this year.\nThe Simpsons say they can only take part in the lawsuit because it's being handled pro bono \u2014\u00a0without charge \"for the public good\" \u2014 by a Vancouver-based law firm.\nLawyer Kailin Che says the firm hopes to finance the legal costs by crowdfunding through a website called \"saynotospectax.com.\"\nThere was a similar attempt last year to raise funds online for a different speculation tax challenge on behalf of Alberta-based B.C. property owners, which\u00a0has yet to proceed.\nBut Che\u00a0says this case will be fought in court \u2014 and could grow.\n\"I believe this petition is the first step to building a larger constitutional challenge that might evolve into a greater class action,\" says Che. \"And we anticipate there will be other lawsuits to follow.\"\nThe civil action alleges the speculation tax \"infringes the petitioners' right to liberty protected\" under the charter.\n\"Choosing where to establish one's home is a quintessentially private decision that goes to the very heart of personal autonomy,\" states the lawsuit. \"The state should not be permitted to interfere in this private decision-making process \u2026 the act effectively coerces the petitioners to rent out their homes.\"\nThe B.C. government has yet to file a legal response. The allegations have not been proven in court.\nDenise Simpson says renting out her family home to strangers isn't an option \u2014 it's full of family memorabilia and memories.\nThe thought of being forced to put the house on the market brings her close to tears.\n\"I would have a total breakdown if I had to sell this \u2026 I'd be devastated, crying,\" she said. \"It'd be like losing a family member.\"\n\"I would never get over having to lose this house. And I would never want to go back to Canada again.\"\n"}, {"author": "Tricia Kindleman", "title": "Small space, big impact: Tiny homes could soon be coming to Edmonton properties", "description": "'It would bring life to an area that is usually not utilized'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/tiny-homes-edmonton-communities-1.5271082", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5271105.1567657258!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/roslyn-garden-suite.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 06, 2019 7:00 AM MT", "2019-09-06T13:00:00.224Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Edmonton is ready to turn over the keys to tiny homes to some Edmonton yards.\nThis week council's urban planning committee tabled a motion that would\u00a0update zoning bylaws making way for tiny home additions in Edmonton communities.\u00a0\nGarden suites up to 1400 square\u00a0feet are already allowed in the city and Ashley Salvador with YEG Garden Suites said the city's plans to lift minimum size requirements will clear the way for tiny homes too.\u00a0\n\"Previously you'd have to have at least 30 square metres,\" Salvador said. \"That has since been removed \u2026 some of the other changes were around allowing mobile home type garden suites to be dropped down in a backyard as a tiny home.\"\nProposed bylaw changes look to boost Edmonton tiny home development\nIn a report to council, city administration recommended allowing tiny homes on foundations for now but delay zoning amendments for tiny homes on wheels until the province updates building codes to accommodate the unique structures.\nTiny homes, usually under 400 square feet, can already be built as single-detached homes or garden suites in the city as\u00a0long as they're constructed onsite and meet building standards.\nSalvador said the number of garden suites in the city has\u00a0more than doubled over the last two years, jumping from 150 suites to around 350.

Lawyers for the Salvation Army, the City of Ottawa\u00a0and opponents presented their opening arguments.\u00a0\nMichael Polowin, the lawyer representing concerned residents and business owners, said his clients aren't opposed to the Salvation Army or the notion of a new shelter, but believe Montreal Road is the wrong place for it because\u00a0the area already struggles with crime, poverty\u00a0and mental health issues.\n\"My clients are not NIMBYs,\" Polowin told the tribunal, adding later that he plans to show the city's decision to approve the shelter flies in the face of its own policies.\n\"City policy says 'not on traditional main streets.' [This shelter]\u00a0fronts on a traditional main street. City policy says 'not in residential areas.'\u00a0Three sides of it are in a residential area. Why is this to be allowed?\" he asked.\nIn their opening arguments, lawyers for the city and Salvation Army said they'll attempt to explain\u00a0why the site was selected, and demonstrate that, despite negative publicity about the shelter, housing prices in the neighbourhood remained unaffected\u00a0and investment continues to flow into the area.\nBut Drew Dobson, who owns Finnigan's Pub, steps away from the shelter site on Montreal Road, disagreed.\n\"If you looked out your back door ... and they bulldozed your neighbours' houses and they put a shelter in, do you think that would help your property value? Or if you had a business on Montreal Road by a shelter and you wanted your customers to walk down the street and feel comfortable coming into your shop to buy your goods, do you think it would help your business?\" asked Dobson, who also\u00a0heads SOS Vanier, the group opposed to the shelter.\nThe facility was initially intended to\u00a0include a\u00a0140-bed emergency shelter, an emergency medical clinic and space for other programming aimed at vulnerable clients.\nBut last June, the Salvation Army said it was open to reconsidering the scope of the project, potentially reducing the number of emergency beds to as few as 70. The charity would also add supportive housing, but keep\u00a0its addictions treatment centre in the ByWard Market.\nThe Salvation Army said it has been listening to residents' concerns.\n\"Certainly, it is important to continue working with people, to listen to the concerns, which we are and will continue to,\" said Marc Provost, executive director of the Salvation Army Ottawa Booth Centre on George Street.\n\"It will be an ongoing dialogue, and that's the focus, is really\u00a0to listen to each other, and I think each time we meet and talk there's more understanding on both sides, and I think that's very positive.\"\nProvost said he remains \"cautiously optimistic\" and trusts the process.\u00a0\nThe hearings are expected to last three weeks, but a decision may not come\u00a0for several months.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2670598941", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2669331263", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2670766367", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2672648361", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2672787721", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2669100063", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/665797699963", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2668798622", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2674797429", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2671892068", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2669144435", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Alexandra Burza, Kate Bueckert", "title": "Funding cuts top of mind as urban mayors meeting gets underway in Guelph", "description": "Large Urban Mayors Caucus brings together mayors from more than 2 dozen municipalities ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/funding-cuts-top-of-mind-as-urban-mayors-meeting-gets-underway-in-guelph-1.5147500", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4682558.1574782588!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/downtown-guelph-ontario-spring-summer-weather.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 24, 2019 6:00 AM ET", "2019-05-28T19:21:31.510Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Premier Doug Ford's announcement that municipalities are expected to trim an extra four per cent from their budgets this year will be a top issue at the Large Urban Mayors Caucus (LUMCO).\nLeaders from more than two dozen communities will be gathering at the caucus on Friday\u00a0in Guelph.\nOther items on the agenda will include affordable housing, public health and funding for recreational facilities.\nKitchener City\u00a0Coun.

Inspt. Martin Graham conducted with Voss in April\u00a02017. The interview was the second one Voss did with Graham, who was heading up the extortion investigation.\nPreviously, Graham had\u00a0suggested that Keith and Marisa Hobbs were having financial difficulties at the time, and wanted the victim to buy Voss a house so money could be obtained by borrowing against the house, which would be obtained by the Hobbs'.\u00a0\nDuring the interview, Voss was questioned why she didn't just leave the alleged victim, whose name is subject to a publication ban. Voss, who both worked for and was romantically involved with the victim at different points, said the victim was ill, and she couldn't \"just leave [them] there to drink [their] head off\" after the victim was discharged from the hospital.\nVoss also said she didn't have anywhere to go, as she had earlier sold her house when she moved in with the alleged victim. When Graham asked Voss if she knew what she was entitled to after leaving a common-law relationship, Voss said no, nobody had told her anything about that.\nHowever, Voss continued to assert that she was being pushed by Marisa Hobbs to allow the victim to buy her a house. Marisa Hobbs told Voss, for example, a house was owed to her because of the ending of the relationship between Voss and the victim, and that Marisa Hobbs did the negotiation with the victim in terms of which house to buy.\nMarisa Hobbs and Voss\u00a0were looking at the house with a value in the range of $450,000 at this point. They viewed a home on Gemstone Drive, but it was turned down\u00a0(earlier in the trial, court heard that Voss also expressed disappointment because the house didn't have granite countertops).\nVoss also told Graham she wanted to go see the house the victim wanted to purchase, but Marisa Hobbs suggested they look at others.\nVoss was looking at other homes, as well, online; they were described to Graham as \"cheaper.\"\nThe deal was repeatedly on, then off again, as expressed by a number of texts between the parties which Graham read to Voss in the interview.\n\"If [the victim] buys me a house, it's fine,\" Voss told Graham. \"If not, it's fine. I just wanted peace.\"\nVoss said she had nowhere else to go. However, she did tell Graham she thought about just packing a bag, going to Toronto, and hiding somewhere the victim couldn't find her.\n\"I should have stuck to my plan,\" Voss told Graham.\nVoss says she\u2019s confused why Keith Hobbs would draw up the court documents, especially as he would know what extortion is, due to past police career. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\nShe also admitted her \"trouble\" was that she believed what Keith and Marisa Hobbs told her.\nFor example, Keith and Marisa Hobbs told Voss they would go to the police with criminal allegations against the victim if the housing deal fell through; there has been much talk during the trial that a contract between the parties was intended to sweep those allegations under the rug\u00a0if the victim bought a house for Voss. The Hobbs' said to the OPP they would go to the police with criminal allegations if a house was purchased, or not.\nVoss, in fact, would tell Graham that she was confused as to why Keith Hobbs would draw that contract up, as he would know what extortion is given his long career as a police officer (he was with the Thunder Bay Police Service for more than 30 years).\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make everybody else believe...\u201d Graham says to Voss. Talks of house value deal not going up until videos are shown to them. \u201cThat is no coincidence.\u201d \u201cI want you to tell me what the plan was.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\nBut Voss\u00a0also told Graham she thought extortion would only apply if she asked for money.\n\"Is there anything I can say to you, anything, that will persuade you to tell me everything?\" Graham asks at one point in the video.\nVoss tells him she believes she was set up by the alleged victim: \"When you step on [their] toes, [they'll] do everything to knock you down.\"\nA series of videos showing the alleged victim acting erratically are brought up again (they've been the focus of much discussion in the trial so far). Keith Hobbs would give the videos, contained on USB sticks, to Craig Loverin, a friend of the victim, so the victim would know how much trouble they're in, court heard earlier.\nIn the video interview, Graham suggests to Voss that Keith and Marisa Hobbs used those videos to extort the victim.\n\"As soon as he and Marisa saw those videos, they saw an opportunity to extort [the victim]\u00a0and get a better deal for you,\" Graham said. \"I think they told you [of the plan].\"\nVoss denied\u00a0knowing of any plan to extort the victim.\nGraham retorted that the house price went up when they saw the videos.\n\u201cMy life is so messed up\u201d says Voss. \u201cJust because I trust people.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\n\"That is no coincidence,\" Graham said. \"I want you to tell me what the plan was.\"\nVoss tells Graham she eventually bought her own house at a price of about $175,000.\n\"My life is so messed up,\" she said. \"Just because I trust people.\"\n\"I haven't done anything wrong in my whole entire life,\" Voss said, breaking out into tears.\nThe interview wrapped up with Voss asking Graham if she's in trouble, and Graham re-iterating that Marisa Hobbs isn't a friend to her.\n\"I don't want to go to jail,\" Voss said.\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" Graham replied.\u00a0\"This is not a good situation.\"\n\"What's going to happen?\" Voss said. \"I'm so scared.\"\n\"They used you,\" Graham said.\n\"Maybe they did,\" Voss said, fighting back more tears.\nAfter the video ended, Graham was questioned by the Crown. He told court it took four searches of the BlackBerry phone owned by Keith Hobbs to get all the data the OPP needed.\nDuring cross-examination, Voss's lawyer George Joseph asked Graham about the alleged victim's status in the community.\nGraham agreed that the victim had wealth and privilege. In the relatioship between Voss and the victim, the victim held the balance of power, Graham said.\nGraham also said in his decades of policing, he had never been involved in an extortion case, nor had laid an extortion charge.\nSome scheduling matters were also discussed Tuesday, with the Crown telling the court it will close its case on Wednesday, when the defence will then be able to present its case.\nThe case itself will proceed for the remainder of the week, and closing arguments will take place Feb. 5 and 7, 2020. A decision may take two months after that due to scheduling issues with the judge.\nCourt will resume Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Get informed on the top stories of the day in one quick scan", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/morning-brief-april-20-2020-1.5535571", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 20, 2020 6:41 AM ET", "2020-04-20T10:42:29.452Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!

The owner of\u00a0The Skagway News in Alaska is willing to turn over his\u00a0small-town business to the right person, for a good price.\nIt's free.\n\"Maybe I'll find the right person just to give it to, and that will be their start in the business,\" Persily said from his home in Anchorage, where he teaches journalism at the University of Alaska.\nThe veteran journalist bought the paper not even a year ago, hoping to run it from afar. He says it's been tough,\u00a0so he's proposing to give it away to someone who's prepared to live in the small, remote\u00a0town of about 1,000 people.\u00a0\nHe got the idea when the paper's Skagway-based editor recently gave notice.\u00a0\n\"I thought, well, I've got to hire a new editor but maybe the best solution is to go find someone who is going to be the owner, the editor, part of the community, and live happily ever after,\" said Persily.\u00a0\nWriting on the paper's website, Persily, 68, reflected on his own start in journalism, when he and his late wife bought the weekly\u00a0newspaper in Wrangell, Alaska, in 1976.\n\"We were young, eager to learn, settle in a community and do good work. We did not have a lot of money, but the newspaper owner and the town gave us a chance. I want to give that same opportunity to someone with The Skagway News,\" he wrote.\n\"Quality and longevity of the newspaper is the most important issue.\"\nPersily\u00a0warns, though \u2014 it's not a money-maker, by any stretch. The entire newspaper business in North America is \"financially sketchy,\" he says.\u00a0\n\"It's just hard, as people go to social media and don't want to pay for real news,\" he said.\n\"Yes, readership is declining as people of my generation die off and younger people seem to think a phone is a newspaper.\"\nThe paper traces its roots to the Klondike Gold Rush, when Skagway was a boomtown\u00a0overrun by stampeders\u00a0headed for the Yukon. Readers may have included Donald Trump's grandfather.\nThe original \"Skaguay News,\" established in 1897, chronicled\u00a0tales of desperate characters and frontier drama\u00a0\u2014 most famously, the shooting death of notorious gangster Soapy Smith, in 1898.\n\"Soapy Smith's Last Bluff Called by Frank Reid,\" reads the front page of July 15, 1898. \"Armed With a Winchester He Endeavors to Intimidate a Large Meeting of Indignant Citizens on the Third Wharf.\"\nThe paper shut down in 1904 as the Gold Rush receded into history, and\u00a0was revived in 1978. It's been\u00a0published regularly\u00a0since then.\n\"Serving the Gateway to the Klondike,\" proclaims the paper's masthead. It publishes twice monthly and a typical issue runs about a dozen or so pages.\u00a0\nThere aren't many gangsters in the headlines these days, but there is drama, and real news.\nA recent issue had\u00a0stories about a Chilkoot Trail hiker surviving a bear attack, state cuts to the town's ferry service, and the local rental housing\u00a0shortage.\u00a0\nThe business's real bread-and-butter, though, is the annual visitors guide published each summer for the hordes of\u00a0tourists disgorged daily by visiting cruise ships. Persily says 110,000 copies of the visitors guides were given away last summer.\u00a0\nTo Persily, running the paper takes passion \u2014 and a lot more.\n\"Work, skills, lack of sleep, commitment, and driving to Whitehorse every other week to pick up the paper from the printer,\"\u00a0he said.\n\"It's a lot of work running a small-town newspaper and reporting on your friends and your neighbours, and doing it fairly and honestly. But I think it can be done.\"\nHe's welcoming emails from anybody who's seriously interested in taking the paper off of his hands. There's\u00a0no deadline for applicants, but he'd like to have somebody in place by January, if possible \u2014 \"before the summer crush comes,\" he said.\nPersily can be reached at paper@alaskan.com.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Mary Voss 'used' by Keith and Marisa Hobbs in extortion scheme: OPP investigator", "description": "Extortion trial for former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs, wife Marisa Hobbs, and Voss continues Tuesday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/hobbs-trial-day-11-1.5382172", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4804701.1573843696!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mayor-keith-hobbs-marissa-voss-outside-court.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 03, 2019 1:18 PM ET", "2019-12-03T21:29:02.778Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs and his wife Marisa Hobbs \"used\" Mary Voss in their scheme to extort another person to buy Voss a house, the OPP investigator in charge of the case said.\nVoss, along with former Thunder Bay mayor Keith Hobbs and his wife Marisa Hobbs, are each facing a charge of extortion over their alleged attempts to force another person to purchase a house for Voss.\nThe trial, which is now in its third week, continued Tuesday with court seeing the remainder of a lengthy interview OPP Det. Inspt. Martin Graham conducted with Voss in April\u00a02017. The interview was the second one Voss did with Graham, who was heading up the extortion investigation.\nPreviously, Graham had\u00a0suggested that Keith and Marisa Hobbs were having financial difficulties at the time, and wanted the victim to buy Voss a house so money could be obtained by borrowing against the house, which would be obtained by the Hobbs'.\u00a0\nDuring the interview, Voss was questioned why she didn't just leave the alleged victim, whose name is subject to a publication ban. Voss, who both worked for and was romantically involved with the victim at different points, said the victim was ill, and she couldn't \"just leave [them] there to drink [their] head off\" after the victim was discharged from the hospital.\nVoss also said she didn't have anywhere to go, as she had earlier sold her house when she moved in with the alleged victim. When Graham asked Voss if she knew what she was entitled to after leaving a common-law relationship, Voss said no, nobody had told her anything about that.\nHowever, Voss continued to assert that she was being pushed by Marisa Hobbs to allow the victim to buy her a house. Marisa Hobbs told Voss, for example, a house was owed to her because of the ending of the relationship between Voss and the victim, and that Marisa Hobbs did the negotiation with the victim in terms of which house to buy.\nMarisa Hobbs and Voss\u00a0were looking at the house with a value in the range of $450,000 at this point. They viewed a home on Gemstone Drive, but it was turned down\u00a0(earlier in the trial, court heard that Voss also expressed disappointment because the house didn't have granite countertops).\nVoss also told Graham she wanted to go see the house the victim wanted to purchase, but Marisa Hobbs suggested they look at others.\nVoss was looking at other homes, as well, online; they were described to Graham as \"cheaper.\"\nThe deal was repeatedly on, then off again, as expressed by a number of texts between the parties which Graham read to Voss in the interview.\n\"If [the victim] buys me a house, it's fine,\" Voss told Graham. \"If not, it's fine. I just wanted peace.\"\nVoss said she had nowhere else to go. However, she did tell Graham she thought about just packing a bag, going to Toronto, and hiding somewhere the victim couldn't find her.\n\"I should have stuck to my plan,\" Voss told Graham.\nVoss says she\u2019s confused why Keith Hobbs would draw up the court documents, especially as he would know what extortion is, due to past police career. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\nShe also admitted her \"trouble\" was that she believed what Keith and Marisa Hobbs told her.\nFor example, Keith and Marisa Hobbs told Voss they would go to the police with criminal allegations against the victim if the housing deal fell through; there has been much talk during the trial that a contract between the parties was intended to sweep those allegations under the rug\u00a0if the victim bought a house for Voss. The Hobbs' said to the OPP they would go to the police with criminal allegations if a house was purchased, or not.\nVoss, in fact, would tell Graham that she was confused as to why Keith Hobbs would draw that contract up, as he would know what extortion is given his long career as a police officer (he was with the Thunder Bay Police Service for more than 30 years).\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make everybody else believe...\u201d Graham says to Voss. Talks of house value deal not going up until videos are shown to them. \u201cThat is no coincidence.\u201d \u201cI want you to tell me what the plan was.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\nBut Voss\u00a0also told Graham she thought extortion would only apply if she asked for money.\n\"Is there anything I can say to you, anything, that will persuade you to tell me everything?\" Graham asks at one point in the video.\nVoss tells him she believes she was set up by the alleged victim: \"When you step on [their] toes, [they'll] do everything to knock you down.\"\nA series of videos showing the alleged victim acting erratically are brought up again (they've been the focus of much discussion in the trial so far). Keith Hobbs would give the videos, contained on USB sticks, to Craig Loverin, a friend of the victim, so the victim would know how much trouble they're in, court heard earlier.\nIn the video interview, Graham suggests to Voss that Keith and Marisa Hobbs used those videos to extort the victim.\n\"As soon as he and Marisa saw those videos, they saw an opportunity to extort [the victim]\u00a0and get a better deal for you,\" Graham said. \"I think they told you [of the plan].\"\nVoss denied\u00a0knowing of any plan to extort the victim.\nGraham retorted that the house price went up when they saw the videos.\n\u201cMy life is so messed up\u201d says Voss. \u201cJust because I trust people.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hobbstrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Hobbstrial</a>\n\"That is no coincidence,\" Graham said. \"I want you to tell me what the plan was.\"\nVoss tells Graham she eventually bought her own house at a price of about $175,000.\n\"My life is so messed up,\" she said. \"Just because I trust people.\"\n\"I haven't done anything wrong in my whole entire life,\" Voss said, breaking out into tears.\nThe interview wrapped up with Voss asking Graham if she's in trouble, and Graham re-iterating that Marisa Hobbs isn't a friend to her.\n\"I don't want to go to jail,\" Voss said.\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" Graham replied.\u00a0\"This is not a good situation.\"\n\"What's going to happen?\" Voss said. \"I'm so scared.\"\n\"They used you,\" Graham said.\n\"Maybe they did,\" Voss said, fighting back more tears.\nAfter the video ended, Graham was questioned by the Crown. He told court it took four searches of the BlackBerry phone owned by Keith Hobbs to get all the data the OPP needed.\nDuring cross-examination, Voss's lawyer George Joseph asked Graham about the alleged victim's status in the community.\nGraham agreed that the victim had wealth and privilege. In the relatioship between Voss and the victim, the victim held the balance of power, Graham said.\nGraham also said in his decades of policing, he had never been involved in an extortion case, nor had laid an extortion charge.\nSome scheduling matters were also discussed Tuesday, with the Crown telling the court it will close its case on Wednesday, when the defence will then be able to present its case.\nThe case itself will proceed for the remainder of the week, and closing arguments will take place Feb. 5 and 7, 2020. A decision may take two months after that due to scheduling issues with the judge.\nCourt will resume Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m.\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "7 reasons Canada could escape economic doom: Don Pittis", "description": "The tentacles of global gloom are reaching out, but Canada has some secret weapons", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/recession-canada-economy-1.5325856", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5326793.1571425801!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/construction-king-street-toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 21, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-10-21T15:14:08.393Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For those looking for some fresh\u00a0economic bad news last week, it wasn't hard to find.\nOn Friday,\u00a0the country that is\u00a0now by some\u00a0measures the world's biggest economy, China, slumped to its lowest ebb in nearly 30 years.\nThe United States, the biggest economy in dollar terms, had frightening news of its own as an\u00a0unexpected\u00a0slump in retail sales demonstrated that country's economic superstar, the consumer, may be about to walk offstage.\nEven Canadian economic gloom got some headline treatment as the papers' business sections\u00a0gave prominent placement to sombre predictions from David Rosenberg, chief economist at wealth management company Gluskin Sheff.\u00a0\n\"Time's up for Canada's economy, experts say,\" was the Toronto Star's headline on the business section front over a story from the Bloomberg business news service that quoted Rosenberg as \"putting the odds of a recession in\u00a0Canada at 80 per cent.\"\nFor whatever reason, in the clickbait media world, it is well known that gloom attracts more attention than\u00a0stories saying that everything is swell. There are various theories about why, going back to our evolutionary past when knowing details about a dangerous tiger contributed more to our ancestors' survival than bland reassurances.\nClearly, if bad economic times are around the corner, we want to know. The problem, of course, is that it's not that simple. As I have mentioned, whatever the fundamental causes of a weakening economy, a growing feeling of gloom can itself contribute to or even create economic weakness.\nDespite all the confidently spoken and written forecasts, no one really knows what is going to happen next. The well-known\u00a0U.S. economist Paul Samuelson once famously wrote that \"Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions,\" and it has been widely observed that economists have an even worse record.\nIn fact, a detailed reading of the Bloomberg\u00a0copy beneath the dismal headline\u00a0offers the\u00a0surprise that the majority of those at the conference being covered, unlike\u00a0the often-gloomy Rosenberg,\u00a0saw no Canadian recession in the coming year.\nAfter my own contribution to the gloomy mood last week, I thought it only fair to tally a few of the reasons why Canada may well not see the worst of any global recession.\nAfter a slow patch Canadian houses are selling again. And while they may have reconsidered for a while, there are signs that the condo builders who have filled skylines with cranes are making too much money to stop. Some have pointed to the recent slump in New York condo prices as a warning, but there are reasons why Canadian cities are different.\nOne of the differences between\u00a0Canada and many other places is that the country's welcome mat means the population, housing demand and economy continue\u00a0to grow. Many of those people come with money in their pockets, feeling Canada is a safe place to keep it. A report last week showed that one in five homes in Canada is bought by someone who arrived in the last 10 years.\nDespite some hints of a slowdown in parts of the economy, Canada keeps making jobs, and wages are rising. Trouble in the energy\u00a0sector may have bottomed out. Overall unemployment keeps hitting record lows and wages keep\u00a0rising. While a slowdown could reverse the trend, the low jobless rate\u00a0and the worker shortage in many sectors may help to bridge a weak patch.\nWhile in other countries prices are stagnant even as central banks cut rates, Canadian inflation remains well within the Bank of Canada target range. Core inflation, the rate the bank's Stephen Poloz uses as a best indicator, averaged more than two per cent. Research has shown one of the reasons inflation remains healthy is that poorer Canadians, who get a fairer share here than in other places, spend it all and stimulate the economy rather that tucking it away as savings.\nDespite the attention we often pay to the debt Canadians carry, there is another group, many with paid-off houses, deep pockets and pensions who will keep doling out that money into retirement.\nA large and growing group of well-heeled retirees who have been helped to save with government retirement programs such as RSPs and tax-free savings accounts will act as a safety net for the wider economy.\nPartly because of the taxes paid by well-employed middle-class Canadians, younger Canadians are among the best educated on the globe. That human capital is a pool of stored wealth that cannot be easily destroyed, even by company failures.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile government spending has been a background issue in the campaign for today's federal election, so far the country has a fiscal pad to help boost the economy should the global slump worsen. Compared to our southern neighbour, Canada's books are sound, and due to several revamps,\u00a0the Canada Pension Plan, while meagre, is adequately funded, most actuaries say.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1580164163707", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Terry Roberts", "title": "N.L. home construction at 50-year low, but sales on the rise following disastrous year", "description": "Real estate leaders hoping industry has bottomed out, and better days ahead", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/home-sales-newfoundland-1.5357548", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5357812.1573659581!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/home-for-sale-st-john-s.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 14, 2019 6:00 AM NT", "2019-11-14T09:30:00.009Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "With new home construction at a 50-year low\u00a0and residential sales on the rise after a disastrous 2018, it's not easy to figure out the Newfoundland and Labrador real estate sector these days.\nBut one thing is for certain: after years of runaway prices and a super-heated construction boom, things have seriously cooled off and\u00a0it's now a buyers' market.\nAccording to figures provided by the N.L. Association of Realtors, the average sale price for a home in the province so far this year is just under $242,000, a drop of more than $8,500 from a year ago.\nAnd that seems to have injected some life into the market, with more than 300 more real estate transactions as of the end of October this year (3,872), in comparison with a 2018 that many realtors would rather forget, when there were 3,550 sales by the same point.\n\"Last year was the worst year we've had in 20 years,\" said Bill Stirling, the association's chief executive officer.\n\"For the first time in several years we're starting to see some optimism in the market.\"\nBut that uptick is not universal, with the bump in sales driven by activity in St. John's, Conception Bay South, Gander\u00a0and Labrador West.\u00a0\nThe number of real estate transactions continued to slide in places like Mount Pearl, the Clarenville-Bonavista region, Grand Falls-Windsor and Corner Brook.\n\"The last two or three years have been pretty rough years in our business,\" Stirling added, noting that membership in the association has dropped by roughly 100 Realtors in the past few years.\nAnd the uptick in sales this year is driven by one category: homes selling between $200,000 and $350,000, or the first-time buyer's market.\n\"If you've got a product priced in that area, those are the ones that are selling the quickest,\" Stirling said.\nThe drop in prices is also a consequence of the glut of homes on the market, with more than 6,000 listings provincewide, which is well above the 10-year average.\nOne of the benchmarks for determining the health of a market is the duration it would take to sell the existing inventory. For Newfoundland and Labrador, if no listings were added, it would take nearly a year and a half to clear the deck, which suggests a sluggish market.\n\"That's strongly in the buyers' market category,\" said Stirling.\nThe glut is a consequence of a weak economy, the cooling-off of a major project construction boom that made this province the envy of the country, and what people like Stirling admit is a fear of how Muskrat Falls will impact electricity rates.\nUnless the province can come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem, the cost of paying for the controversial hydroelectric project could double electricity bills by 2021.\nIt all adds up to fragile consumer confidence.\nAs such, much of the renovation market is now being driven by energy-efficiency projects, including the installation of heat pumps, which reduce electricity use.\nTougher mortgage stress-testing rules, which require prospective buyers to make larger down payments and prove they can still make payments if interest rates rise,\u00a0is also preventing some prospective home buyers from entering the market.\nHowever, recent tweaks to the rules, including repayable loans for those struggling with a down payment, have helped, industry leaders say.\nDespite these ominous trends, Stirling said there's cautious optimism that a rebound is around the corner. The province wants to double oil production within the next decade, for example, which would help restore confidence to the marketplace.\nMeanwhile, the picture is especially bleak right now for those who specialize in new home construction. With so many existing homes on the market, and prices dropping, buyers are seeing the upside of investing in a mature property.\nOver the past decade, there was an average of 2,400 housing starts annually\u00a0in the province. But that average will fall dramatically after 2019 numbers are factored in, with new builds expected to fall well below 1,000.\n\"We've been sliding for a few years now and in fact we're probably hitting a low of about 50 years for new home construction in this province,\" said Victoria Belbin, CEO of the provincial chapter of the Canadian Home Builders' Association.\nThat's forced companies that specialize in new builds to either make big adjustments, including turning their attention to the renovation market, or get\u00a0out of the business altogether, said Dieter Staubitzer of New Victorian Homes in St. John's.\nStaubitzer has been building homes for nearly three decades, and enjoyed a record decade of activity that came crashing down in 2013-14.\n\"We've had to change our structure dramatically in the last couple of years.\u00a0And we've had to scale back and adapt. And it's a hard thing to do when you have good people around you and so on,\" he said.\nStaubitzer is now specializing in smaller, more affordable and energy-efficient homes, because that's where the market has shifted.\n\"We're going to try to build the right product and help out the folks that need affordable homes,\" he said.\nAnd some home builders are back in the trenches, trying to stay afloat, said Belbin.\n\"We do have members that have put the belts back on. And they're back on site, whereas before they might have just been managing the projects,\" Belbin explained.\nBut Staubitzer is an optimistic person, and sees better days ahead.\n\"Things are improving and I know our sales board is looking pretty good for this year. The pie is smaller.

At the end of August, Statistics Canada reported that Canada's economy expanded for the fourth month in a row in June, with 17 of the 20 industries that the\u00a0data agency tracks growing.\nWhat's more, from April to June, Canada's economy grew at a 3.7 per cent annual pace. That's better than what economists were expecting, and the fastest pace in more than two years.\nThe majority of Canadians say they have to think about money, but they're getting by. Just over one in 10 say they are not getting by.\nCanada's jobless rate remained at 5.7 per cent for a second month in September, as the economy added 81,100 net new positions, the bulk of which were part time, in the services sector and picked up by young people.\n\"Stepping back from the monthly swings, the trend remains healthy \u2014 a 30,000 average pace of hiring over the last six months is healthy by any measure,\" Brian DePratto, a senior economist with TD Economics, told CBC News.\nWages in Canada are also on the rise after a long period of stagnation. In\u00a0 August, Statistics Canada reported that wages increased by 4.5 per cent in the past 12 months, the fastest annual pace in a decade.\nDefinitely. For every dollar Canadians earn, they owe about $1.77.\nThere is some good news. In the first quarter of 2019, Canadians took on less credit\u00a0debt.\nBut their total debt levels \u2014 including mortgages, credit card debt, and all other forms of personal debt \u2014 continue to grow.\nThe Bank of Canada left its central rate unchanged in September for the seventh cycle in a row. It sits at 1.75 per cent.\n\"Canada's economy is operating close to potential and inflation is on target,\" the bank said. \"However, escalating trade conflicts and related uncertainty are taking a toll on the global and Canadian economies.\"\nIn short, the bank\u00a0will adjust if necessary,\u00a0cutting its rate if it feels it needs to to stimulate the economy\u00a0and\u00a0raising it in order to tame inflation.\nEconomists and other market watchers are split on whether a rate cut is coming this fall.\nThe last time there was a rate change was in October 2018, when it was increased by 0.25 per cent.\nAccording to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the housing market is actually doing a little better today than it had been for the past two years or so.\nThe CMHC says there's little evidence of widespread overheating, price acceleration\u00a0or overbuilding. But there's enough overvaluation to warrant a yellow flag, indicating a \"moderate\" level of vulnerability.\nAs usual, there are a few regions that raise some concern. Regina was given a red warning for overbuilding, while Victoria, Hamilton and Toronto's markets were given a\u00a0red \u2014\u00a0or \"high\"\u00a0\u2014 overall.\nAccording to a study released in July,\u00a0the answer is overwhelmingly no. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) used data from Statistics Canada and the CMHC\u00a0to evaluate\u00a0almost 800 neighbourhoods across Canada's three dozen largest cities.\nIt concluded that a minimum wage earner could afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment in just 24 neighbourhoods across the country, out of 795 analyzed.\nIt will come as no surprise to hear that it is most expensive to rent in the biggest cities:\u00a0Toronto and Vancouver.\u00a0\nThe CCPA study found only three cities where the local minimum wage would be enough to comfortably afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment and have enough left over for other expenses (about two-thirds of earnings), if working 40 hours a week.\nAll are in Quebec: Sherbrooke, Saguenay and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\nThis recent episode from Marketplace looks into the vast discrepancy in food prices in Iqaluit versus in Winnipeg to try to discern why it costs so much more to buy groceries in the North.\nBut it's just not only Canadians living in the North who are feeling the pinch.\nAfter the release of the new Canada Food Guide earlier this year, Angus Reid polled Canadians about whether they would be able to eat the way the guide recommended. Four in 10\u00a0respondents called the recommendations \"unrealistic.\"\n"}, {"author": "Steve Silva", "title": "Yellowknife Women's Society renovating part of office into daycare", "description": "One of the organization's daycares is temporarily being operated out of a church", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-womens-society-daycare-1.5156795", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5156803.1559261096!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/yellowknife-women-s-society-office.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 31, 2019 5:00 AM CT", "2019-05-31T11:00:00.023Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A Yellowknife charitable organization is renovating part of its office to accommodate a daycare space.\n\"This is us expanding our programming to fill a gap,\" explained Yellowknife Women's Society (YWS) board member Shauna Morgan on Thursday.\nThe gap opened last November, when Kids Corner Childcare shut down.\nIn response, the women's society\u00a0opened a daycare in a church to provide care to the kids impacted.

The money will be used for the renovations, including installing an area for kids to play in.\n\"It's definitely a huge relief to get that funding,\" Morgan said.\nThe plan is to open the daycare in the coming months.\nAs reported earlier in the week, the organization also wants to turn the Arnica Inn into transitional housing, which is also where its office would relocate to.\n"}, {"author": "Colin Butler", "title": "Tenant blamed, threatened over landlord's inability to rent vacant illegal bedroom", "description": "Centurion Property Associates owns apartments in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Alberta", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-apartment-rental-centurion-properties-1.5309384", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309623.1570227438!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jeremy-roberts.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 07, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-07T09:00:00.829Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A tenant\u00a0of a troubled downtown\u00a0London highrise said\u00a0he and others were blamed and threatened by their\u00a0landlord after\u00a0no one wanted to rent a vacant\u00a0illegal bedroom inside their apartment unit.\u00a0\nJeremy Roberts said he was told he would have to\u00a0pay for the landlord's lost income even though the bedroom in question was considered unfit for human habitation under provincial law.\u00a0\nRoberts is a Western University student who rents a one-bedroom apartment at 75 Ann Street, a downtown London highrise known as The Marq.\nThe retrofitted apartment building is\u00a0marketed toward post-secondary students\u00a0by Centurion Property Associates, a multi-million dollar company that owns dozens of rental buildings across\u00a0Ontario, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\u00a0\nThe company is currently the subject of a property standards investigation by the City of London after complaints surfaced it was renting illegal windowless apartments for hundreds of dollars a month inside its\u00a075 Ann Street highrise.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLondon landlord under investigation for renting 'windowless, closetless box' to student\nWindowless bedrooms are illegal in Ontario and are not considered fit for human habitation due to a lack of proper ventilation and natural light.\nThe units\u00a0at 75 Ann Street appear to be a retrofitted to allow\u00a0up to four tenants to share a\u00a0living room, kitchen, two bathrooms and a storage space in what was once a larger unit with only two bedrooms.\u00a0\nTenants open their individual bedrooms\u00a0with their respective fob keys, which also give them access to the main door of the building and the unit's shared spaces.\u00a0\nRoberts said he pays $635 a month for a bedroom with a window and that his landlord has been trying to rent a vacant, windowless bedroom inside his unit since August.\u00a0\nHe said after a number of unsuccessful showings by the landlord, he and the other tenants were blamed for no-one wanting to rent the windowless bedroom and were threatened with having to pay for the landlord's lost income.\u00a0\n\"They're frustrated they can't rent it out,\" Roberts said, noting at least three prospective tenants have tried living in the unventilated space since he moved there in May of 2018.\nAccording to an August 29 email obtained by CBC News, Christopher Maclean, the property administrator at 75 Ann Street, complained that prospective tenants had\u00a0\"expressed concerns about the condition of the unit.\"\u00a0\n\"Please make the necessary efforts to ensure your unit remains in a habitable condition. If the unit remains unrentable due to the condition you may be charged back the lost rental income for the vacant room,\" he wrote in the email.\u00a0\n\"I think the email was inappropriate,\" Roberts said, noting that the windowless bedroom\u00a0being shown to prospective tenants was illegal to begin with.\u00a0\n\"They didn't have a right to rent out this bedroom in the first place and yet they were threatening me,\" Roberts said. \"They were going to bill me for lost income.\u00a0It's very stressful.\"\nBoth Christopher Maclean and his employer Centurion Property Associates, which owns dozens of apartment buildings across four provinces,\u00a0did not reply to a request for comment from CBC News.\u00a0\nIn an email sent to tenants at 75 Ann Street on Friday, the company wrote \"these units have been rented by Centurion and the building's two previous owners without incident or concern since the building was built in 2003.\"\nCenturion wrote that it is working cooperatively with London by-law enforcement to resolve the matter and that there is \"no indication of safety-related matters or the need for residents to relocate.\"\u00a0\nStill,\u00a0Kenneth Hale, a Toronto-based lawyer who specializes in tenancy law, questions how the company was able to rent windowless units in the first place.\u00a0\n\"When you hear something like this you would think this is some smalltime landlord that doesn't understand what their legal obligations are, but this is a company that owns thousands and thousands of units,\" he said.\u00a0\nHale is\u00a0the legal director of Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, which advocates for human rights and justice when it comes housing in the province.\u00a0\n\"I think it is pretty shocking.\u00a0This is not the kind of behaviour we should be looking for from these large corporate landlord.\" said Hale.\u00a0\nThe reason large corporate landlords can get away with such behaviour is because competition for apartments, even substandard ones, is high thanks to Ontario's incredibly low housing inventories, he said.\u00a0\n\"This is a good example of what that housing shortage creates,\" he said. They're basically selling water in a desert.\"\nHale said successive Ontario governments have done little keep\u00a0builders,\u00a0developers and landlords in check, allowing them far too much leeway and\u00a0power when it comes to determining the price and availability of housing in Ontario.\u00a0\n\"We let the private market dictate what housing is going to be built and what it's going to cost,\" he said.\u00a0\"We have a shortage of housing because of the kind of housing policy we've pursued.\"\nHale called Roberts' treatment by Centurion a form of harassment and said people who rent\u00a0deserve to live in accommodations that meet minimum provincial standards, such as windows in bedrooms.\u00a0\n\"They also deserve a little bit of\u00a0respect\u00a0and proper treatment from the people who are running it and I think the higher up corporate types need to take some responsibility.\"\nHale said student\u00a0tenants can seek free legal advice from Community Legal Services at Western University. They can also file an official complaint about a landlord with the\u00a0Ontario Ministry of Housing.\nStill, Hale concedes that it is a David and Goliath battle for students to take on a multi-million dollar corporation such as Centurion Property Associates.\u00a0\n\"I would hope that having some of these practices exposed in public would have some pressure to have the companies change their behaviour, but I'm not really confident that's enough to do it.\"\nHale said what's needed is the Ontario government stepping in and creating policy that favours tenants instead large corporate landlords.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Prajwala Dixit", "title": "How tiny homes could provide a path to security for new Canadians", "description": "They're not just an emerging lifestyle: they're a potential solution to affordable housing", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/tiny-homes-more-than-a-trend-prajwala-dixit-1.5061237", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jul 21, 2019 8:00 AM NT", "2019-07-21T10:30:00.571Z"], "source": null, "content": "Tiny homes are more than just a trend;\u00a0they're\u00a0a triple threat, an emerging lifestyle, a potential solution to affordable housing \u2014 and,\u00a0possibly,\u00a0the first home of a\u00a0new immigrant renter.\nIn St. John's, about 12,100 households live in unaffordable housing, of which nearly\u00a065 per cent rent. More than\u00a08,900 tenant households require improvement to meet one or more of\u00a0affordability, adequacy, or suitability standards.\nAffordable housing is a real problem in our city, and this is only exacerbated when one is\u00a0a new immigrant. A lack of understanding of the real estate market,\u00a0whether renting or buying,\u00a0the loss of a social network, language barriers and employment challenges make the search for\u00a0affordable housing akin to running on a never-stopping treadmill.\nRegardless of the economic\u00a0status, the path to affordable housing is fraught with obstacles for a new immigrant in their first\u00a0year in Canada.\n\"The main concerns are that they are required to establish Canadian credit which often is\u00a0not an instant item to secure,\" said mortgage professional, Cheryl Stoyles-Sellars of Verico Premiere Mortgage Centre.\n\"This is typically arranged with the financial institution that they\u00a0initially open a Canadian bank account with. There is often a need to do a secured credit product\u00a0to establish the credit item.\"\nFor some immigrants this is an easy task, but for others who may lack the financial\u00a0means, a secured credit product\u00a0can't be acquired easily.\nIn the\u00a0first year, for example, new immigrants don't have room to contribute to an RRSP, as there\u00a0typically is not\u00a0any Canadian source of income to report from the previous year. These\u00a0impediments make\u00a0renting seem like the only viable option for housing \u2014\u00a0propelling new immigrants toward tenancy,\u00a0at least when they first arrive.\nEchoing these thoughts, Realtor Amanda Arsenault of Hanlon Realty said, \"Financing\u00a0has to be the biggest barrier [for new immigrants]. The Canadian government and the provincial\u00a0government need to realize this because immigrants are a huge part of Canada's today, tomorrow\u00a0and future.\"\nStephenville's Brook Street \u00a0is now home to a\u00a0new subdivision of 600-square-feet homes that are complete with appliances, a solid foundation,\u00a0a backyard and sodded lawn \u2014\u00a0and all only for $90,000 \u2014\u00a0busting the stereotypical\u00a0image of a\u00a0house on wheels.\nSome might assume that these homes are simply a fad, but,\u00a0with an average\u00a0home costing over a quarter of million dollars, they may be a sustainable solution to the lack of\u00a0affordable housing for several demographics, including first-time immigrant renters, like\u00a0international students, who often end up living in dark and dank basements to conserve their finances.\nChris Janes, senior market analyst with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, says\u00a0tiny homes work.\n\"For anybody looking for space that is economical, innovative\u00a0and comfortable\u00a0[and] relatively close to urban amenities. I think it can be successful for particularly\u00a0first-time buyers, immigrants, millennials and retirees,\" said Janes.\u00a0\nHe indicated that owing to the changing\u00a0household composition, tiny homes were an emerging lifestyle.\nNot only a solution for affordable housing, Winnie Lei, a ReMax realty specialist with\u00a0St. John's Life, said tiny homes could be the answer to downtown\u00a0parking woes.\n\"It might be a good fit for torn-down properties downtown where the\u00a0extra square footages can be used for off-street parking,\" said Lei.\nRecent developments in the City of St. John's regulation now include tiny homes as an\u00a0in-fill in certain\u00a0residential zones, as well as a new zone for pocket neighbourhoods of tiny\u00a0homes.  But not everyone is sold on the idea of a tiny home. The size, lack of information around\u00a0appropriate city bylaws regarding this housing model and finding appropriate financing are\u00a0some reasons why tiny homes haven't taken off (yet) in St. John's.\n\"It has proven very difficult for clients to obtain mortgage financing on tiny homes. The\u00a0lenders would consider them to be in the same category as mobile homes or mini homes,\" said\u00a0Stoyles-Sellars.\nDespite this, its economical, low-carbon footprint qualities, the low energy and\u00a0maintenance costs, and its price\u00a0make this model attractive to many \u2014 including developers, first-time home\u00a0buyers and, subsequently, renters.\nFor new immigrants who are limited financially in their ability\u00a0to buy or rent when they first arrive and, sadly, end up in inadequate and unsuitable homes (such\u00a0as dark and dank basement apartments), this provides a new housing option.\nA home is more than four walls and a roof. It is a fundamental human right.\u00a0And tiny homes are a potential\u00a0solution to the affordable housing predicament not only for first-time home buyers but also renters.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Dana Hatherly", "title": "Cyclists complete tour across 3 U.S. states, raise $125K for Habitat for Humanity home", "description": "1254-km journey took two weeks from\u00a0Baker City, Ore. to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/cycle-hope-tour-complete-affordable-housing-1.5219378", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5211172.1563050865!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/habitat-for-humanity-cycle-of-hope-2019.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 21, 2019 7:42 AM CT", "2019-07-21T12:42:07.960Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "More than two dozen Winnipeggers\u00a0who each cycled\u00a0more than 1,250 kilometres were welcomed back to the city by supporters\u00a0perched in front of a new home the cyclists helped raise money to build.\nThe cycling tour\u00a0took the group\u00a0on a\u00a0journey\u00a0across three U.S. states along the\u00a0TransAmerica Trail from\u00a0Baker City, Ore. to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.\nAfter two weeks on the road, riders in the 2019 Cycle of Hope series were greeted by their families, friends and the sounds of hardworking volunteers\u00a0powering up drills, stapling\u00a0plywood and hammering\u00a0nails at the Habitat for Humanity construction site on Selkirk Avenue Saturday afternoon.\nOn July 6, John Loewen and his teenaged son Sam, 15, strapped on their helmets to tackle\u00a0the challenging trek together for the first time.

Dozens of volunteers work together\u00a0under red seal carpenters and trades partners who will install plumbing and electrical.\n\"We're deeply indebted to those people for volunteering so much of their time, energy and effort to help a family to a better life,\" Hopkins said about the cyclists, support crew and volunteer construction workers it will take to\u00a0eventually put a roof up on the soon-to-be home.\nIn order to be eligible for the program, Habitat\u00a0requires families who need housing to have a child under 10-years- old and one\u00a0adult in the family who\u00a0works full-time in the community.\nThe family must also meet\u00a0provincial requirements for housing subsidies. Once approved, a professional\u00a0appraiser will put\u00a0a price on the home before the family\u00a0effectively buys it.\nWhat makes it affordable is that there's no down payment or interest on the mortgage for the first 15 years, and\u00a0payments are geared to what the family can afford to pay as opposed to being based on the value of the house.\nThe home funded by this year's cycle series is expected to be ready for the family to move in in about four months.\nMore from CBC Manitoba:\n"}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "Wood Buffalo council will lobby province over condo insurance crisis", "description": "Some condo owners forced to pay $6,000 more each year for insurance", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wood-buffalo-condominium-insurance-1.5334197", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318783.1570825189!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winchester-greens.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 25, 2019 8:00 AM MT", "2019-10-25T14:00:00.961Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Councillors with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo plan to lobby\u00a0the provincial government after hearing from condo residents about the insurance crisis following the 2016 Fort McMurray\u00a0wildfire.\nAt a public hearing Tuesday, representatives from three condo complexes described how\u00a0the inability to find property insurance is affecting the lives of residents.\n\"We're going to see foreclosures; we're going to see people forced from their homes,\" said Robert Guy, with Cedarwoods\u00a0Condominium Corporation.\n\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIn August, the complex of 156 townhouses learned\u00a0its insurer\u00a0would no longer offer coverage.\u00a0\nThe only insurance the board could find comes with a\u00a0$947,000 premium and only covers\u00a0$10 million of the $65-million property.

Nearly every seat went to the Conservatives.\nSince the election, talk in\u00a0those two provinces of separating from Canada has grown, fuelled\u00a0in part by frustration from\u00a0the lengthy downturn in the oil industry.\nA Facebook group promoting the idea has ballooned to more than 250,000 members. The hashtag #Wexit \u2014 standing for Western Exit \u2014\u00a0has trended on social media.\n\"Let's face it. The discussions around separation, it's alive and happening in communities here in the province,\" Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said earlier this week as he issued a list of demands to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nAalbers said the frustration is understandable and the government needs to do much more to address it.\nIn the Lloydminster area, only two\u00a0of 45 drilling rigs are operating, he said. Companies are laying off workers. Housing starts are down. \"For sale\" signs and shuttered businesses are common.\nAalbers said the separation talk is an expression of this frustration and fear, but it doesn't mean people actually want to leave Canada and form a separate country.\n\"If I was losing my job, my business, my home, I'd be under stress. I'm going to lash back,\" he said.\n\"I think that's what we've seen. People have expressed those feelings that are close to their heart. But when they sit down and look at it, we live in a great country.\"\nCBC News spoke with dozens of people in and around Lloydminster this week, including oil workers, farmers, cab drivers, teachers and seniors.\nThey talked about a federal government they see as \"anti-western\" and hypocritical. They wonder why tankers are allowed to carry oil in the St. Lawrence Seaway but not the B.C. coast, effectively blocking Prairie shipments. They say it makes no sense for refineries in New Brunswick to process oil from Saudi Arabia but not from Western Canada.\nBut despite the frustration, none of them supported any form of separation.\nSome, like Ted Harland, don't see the federal Liberals as the biggest problem.\nHarland has been forced to lay off nearly half of the 15 workers\u00a0at his oil pump assembly business. He said more pipelines and better policies would help, but there are two far bigger culprits: low world oil prices and new\u00a0technology that requires fewer workers to operate.\nIn the Lloydminster area, the traditional method of cold water and sand extraction is being replaced\u00a0by what's known as steam-assisted gravity drainage.\u00a0Harland, Aalbers and others say this method requires 75 per cent fewer workers to harvest that same barrel of oil.\n\"There's a whole bunch of factors. Obviously, everybody hears about the pipeline and getting their oil to the market. But around the Lloyd area, it's a technology shift,\" Harland said in an interview from his shop floor.\nMore than $4 million worth of equipment is ready for sale in Harland's shop, but it won't end up in the Lloydminster oilpatch. He's selling to buyers in\u00a0Indonesia, Australia\u00a0and South America.\nTeacher and NDP supporter Colleen Henning said she feels for her friends and for parents of her students who've lost their jobs. She said the government needs to provide better job training to support families as they transition.\nShe also said Lloydminster needs to diversify its economy if the city is going to survive.\n\"At one time, every small town had a blacksmith shop. They had a hatmaker. We don't see those industries anymore. They're gone because times changed. It's something we have to accept.\"\nAalbers said the city is diversifying and looking internationally for new opportunities, but Lloydminster oil is still needed while Canada is dependent on hydrocarbons to heat their homes and run their communities.\nThe mayor said he's committed to working with all federal parties if they show they're serious about helping the Prairies.\n\"Democracy is imperfect,\" Aalbers said. \"But it's the best system we have.\"\nConservative MP Rosemarie Falk, who captured 70 per cent of the vote in the area, agrees\u00a0there is work to be done.\n\"Obviously, I'm a federalist. I believe the country works very well when we're working together, and it would be a shame to see parts separate,\" Falk said.\n\"That said, Justin Trudeau needs to listen.\"\n"}, {"author": "Bethany Lindsay", "title": "Casino management ignored workers' warnings about money laundering, B.C. union head charges", "description": "Cullen Commission kicks off with opening statements from government, representatives of gambling sector", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-cullen-commission-money-laundering-set-up-1.5472412", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5123325.1584301203!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/casino-gambling-slot-machine.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 24, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-02-25T01:20:13.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The president of one of B.C.'s biggest labour unions is asking the province's public inquiry on money laundering to consider how illegal money has affected the lives of everyday working people.\nStephanie Smith, president of the B.C.

Supreme Court Justice Austin Cullen sits at the head of the commission, which will hear opening statements this week from stakeholders with formal standing in the inquiry.\nSmith said she'd like to see the commission tackle how to protect whistleblowers, including former casino employees who've gone to the media with what they've seen at the gambling tables. She also wants to hear about whether senior management knowingly ignored warnings of trouble, as well as the impact on B.C.'s housing market.\nSmith said she's also interested in presenting evidence about how new rules meant to head off money launderers are working in practice.\n\"Our members report that in many cases management are simply going through the motions \u2026 but making it clear to employees that these are unwanted requirements,\" she said.\nBut the commission also heard from those who believe the scale of the problem in B.C.'s casinos has been exaggerated.\nSmith was immediately followed by William Smart, counsel for the B.C. Lottery Corporation, who argued that much of the public perception about widespread money laundering is \"misinformed.\"\n\"Much has changed in the last 20 years in terms of gaming in this province,\" Smart said.\nSmart said the\u00a0BCLC has brought in \"effective measures\" to counter money launderers, including banning certain criminals from casinos and offering training for identifying suspicious transactions.\nThose sentiments were shared by Mark Skwarok, counsel for Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, which operates 10 casinos and gambling facilities in B.C.\nSkwarok said the\u00a0BCLC has provided diligent oversight, and argued that many public criticisms of Great Canadian have been \"factually unfounded or have been overstated.\"\nMonday's proceedings kicked off with opening statements from lawyers representing both the federal and provincial governments who gave a primer on the systems that are now in place or will soon be in place in an attempt to make B.C. a less attractive place for those trying to hide the proceeds of crime.\nThe morning's proceedings included a dictionary's worth of acronyms for all the government bodies, working groups, police task forces, international partnerships and pieces of legislation that have been involved in trying to fix the problem \u2014 including FSOC, GPEB, PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, IIGET, JIGET, CSIS, CBSA, CFSEU, CRA, PPSC, and FATF, to name just a few.\nThe commission was announced last year in a response to a series of reports that attempted to capture the alarming extent of B.C.'s problem, including estimates that more than $7 billion was laundered in the province in 2018.\nThe role of the commission is to determine where and how money laundering is taking place, why it's been allowed to happen and whether it can be prevented. The commission doesn't have the power to convict or find liability but is expected to issue recommendations in its final report in May 2021.\nOthers scheduled to make opening statements this week include representatives of the legal profession and the casino, real estate and luxury car industries.\nAnother session, beginning May 25 and running five weeks, will deal with an overview of money laundering and regulatory models, as well as the extent of illegal activity in the province.\nThe main hearings begin in September and will deal with more than a dozen identified areas of illegal activity in the B.C. economy, from gambling transactions on the floor of some of Metro Vancouver's biggest casinos, to cash transactions for luxury goods and online trading of cryptocurrency.\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Trade war darkens economic forecasts for Canada", "description": "National Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut growth forecasts for 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-banks-growth-1.5161849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3209062.1518187080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 4:21 PM ET", "2019-06-04T20:21:11.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Two big banks cut Canada's growth forecasts on rising trade tensions\u00a0this week, and others could follow suit if the new U.S. tariffs against Mexico are implemented next week.\nEconomists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch revised Canada's growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent for this year, and made an even bigger cut to their growth estimate\u00a0for\u00a0next year from 1.8 per cent to 1.3 per cent.\n\"We had already marked downside risks to our GDP growth forecast for 2019 given lower oil prices and risks of trade war escalation,\" economists said in a note on Tuesday.\n\"With the U.S. threat of tariffs to Mexico, trade wars have effectively escalated, and uncertainty over global trade increases, which is negative for Canadian investment and exports.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed\u00a0in a news conference in London on Tuesday that he would likely order new tariffs on Mexican exports\u00a0next Monday, because of\u00a0a high number of Mexican migrants\u00a0entering the U.S.\nThe economists also said they believe that it is\u00a0now \"unlikely\" that the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be approved this year, because of the new tariffs.\n\"In our new numbers we are using our estimate that a 10 per cent\u00a0drop in Canadian exports would reduce Canada's GDP by 210 basis points,\" the report\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"Strong domestic demand in the first quarter\u00a0shows that there is some upside risk to our forecasts.

Government and Service Employees' Union, told the Cullen Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering that union members have been dealing with the problem for decades.\nThat includes dealing with criminals trying to clean illegal cash through casinos or facing the ever-rising home prices that have been linked to that same cash.\n\"Workers in some casinos have faced a visible organized crime presence for at least two decades,\" Smith said in her opening statements on Monday.\n\"All too often, casino management has ignored these issues or even encouraged them.\"\nB.C. Supreme Court Justice Austin Cullen sits at the head of the commission, which will hear opening statements this week from stakeholders with formal standing in the inquiry.\nSmith said she'd like to see the commission tackle how to protect whistleblowers, including former casino employees who've gone to the media with what they've seen at the gambling tables. She also wants to hear about whether senior management knowingly ignored warnings of trouble, as well as the impact on B.C.'s housing market.\nSmith said she's also interested in presenting evidence about how new rules meant to head off money launderers are working in practice.\n\"Our members report that in many cases management are simply going through the motions \u2026 but making it clear to employees that these are unwanted requirements,\" she said.\nBut the commission also heard from those who believe the scale of the problem in B.C.'s casinos has been exaggerated.\nSmith was immediately followed by William Smart, counsel for the B.C. Lottery Corporation, who argued that much of the public perception about widespread money laundering is \"misinformed.\"\n\"Much has changed in the last 20 years in terms of gaming in this province,\" Smart said.\nSmart said the\u00a0BCLC has brought in \"effective measures\" to counter money launderers, including banning certain criminals from casinos and offering training for identifying suspicious transactions.\nThose sentiments were shared by Mark Skwarok, counsel for Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, which operates 10 casinos and gambling facilities in B.C.\nSkwarok said the\u00a0BCLC has provided diligent oversight, and argued that many public criticisms of Great Canadian have been \"factually unfounded or have been overstated.\"\nMonday's proceedings kicked off with opening statements from lawyers representing both the federal and provincial governments who gave a primer on the systems that are now in place or will soon be in place in an attempt to make B.C. a less attractive place for those trying to hide the proceeds of crime.\nThe morning's proceedings included a dictionary's worth of acronyms for all the government bodies, working groups, police task forces, international partnerships and pieces of legislation that have been involved in trying to fix the problem \u2014 including FSOC, GPEB, PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, IIGET, JIGET, CSIS, CBSA, CFSEU, CRA, PPSC, and FATF, to name just a few.\nThe commission was announced last year in a response to a series of reports that attempted to capture the alarming extent of B.C.'s problem, including estimates that more than $7 billion was laundered in the province in 2018.\nThe role of the commission is to determine where and how money laundering is taking place, why it's been allowed to happen and whether it can be prevented. The commission doesn't have the power to convict or find liability but is expected to issue recommendations in its final report in May 2021.\nOthers scheduled to make opening statements this week include representatives of the legal profession and the casino, real estate and luxury car industries.\nAnother session, beginning May 25 and running five weeks, will deal with an overview of money laundering and regulatory models, as well as the extent of illegal activity in the province.\nThe main hearings begin in September and will deal with more than a dozen identified areas of illegal activity in the B.C. economy, from gambling transactions on the floor of some of Metro Vancouver's biggest casinos, to cash transactions for luxury goods and online trading of cryptocurrency.\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Trade war darkens economic forecasts for Canada", "description": "National Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut growth forecasts for 2019", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-banks-growth-1.5161849", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3209062.1518187080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 04, 2019 4:21 PM ET", "2019-06-04T20:21:11.613Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Two big banks cut Canada's growth forecasts on rising trade tensions\u00a0this week, and others could follow suit if the new U.S. tariffs against Mexico are implemented next week.\nEconomists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch revised Canada's growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent for this year, and made an even bigger cut to their growth estimate\u00a0for\u00a0next year from 1.8 per cent to 1.3 per cent.\n\"We had already marked downside risks to our GDP growth forecast for 2019 given lower oil prices and risks of trade war escalation,\" economists said in a note on Tuesday.\n\"With the U.S. threat of tariffs to Mexico, trade wars have effectively escalated, and uncertainty over global trade increases, which is negative for Canadian investment and exports.\"\nU.S. President Donald Trump reaffirmed\u00a0in a news conference in London on Tuesday that he would likely order new tariffs on Mexican exports\u00a0next Monday, because of\u00a0a high number of Mexican migrants\u00a0entering the U.S.\nThe economists also said they believe that it is\u00a0now \"unlikely\" that the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be approved this year, because of the new tariffs.\n\"In our new numbers we are using our estimate that a 10 per cent\u00a0drop in Canadian exports would reduce Canada's GDP by 210 basis points,\" the report\u00a0said.\u00a0\n\"Strong domestic demand in the first quarter\u00a0shows that there is some upside risk to our forecasts.

The loft-style units would feature rooms about the size of two standard parking spaces, as well as electric cars to be shared among occupants.\n\"There's now an option to be in a more central location at a fraction of the cost and not have that burden of running a vehicle and starting at 40 below,\" said Guy. \"They sound on the small side, but like boat design, there's not a cubic inch that's wasted.\"\nThe proposal marks the arrival in Yellowknife of a type of housing that is popular in big cities like Toronto and Vancouver with millennials who value affordability, proximity to amenities\u00a0and environmentally-friendly lifestyles.\nThe 320-square-foot, loft-style condos will be fully-furnished and will include kitchenettes, granite countertops, laundry facilities and an open concept living-dining area.\u00a0\nGuy submitted a development application to the city in early June and hopes to begin construction before the end of the summer.\u00a0\nHe said the price of one unit will be around $200,000.\nGuy said he based the plans for the development on the principles of \"new urbanism,\" an urban design philosophy that promotes denser neighbourhoods, building housing close to shopping, repurposing abandoned areas, and strong public transportation systems.\nThe building will be the first to take advantage of the so-called \"car-share\" provisions of the city's zoning bylaw, which allows developers to reduce the required number of parking spaces per unit if they provide at least one shared car for every eight units.\u00a0\nWithout providing the two electric vehicles, Guy would be required to build a total of 12 parking spaces and wouldn't be able to fit both the building and the parking spaces without buying an adjacent lot.\u00a0\nInstead, the condo corporation will own the two vehicles and occupants will determine the process for sharing them.\nHousing options like this will help to revitalize the city's downtown core by attracting people to affordable, eco-friendly housing, according to Guy.\u00a0\n\"What we're really looking at is making and giving downtown back to people rather than cars,\" said Guy. \"People are good for business and if you can have affordable housing you will have more people and I think it's a win-win for the whole community.\"\nLen Catling, a spokesperson for the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), said tiny homes like the ones proposed by Guy have popped up in cities across Canada as housing markets heat up and people search for more affordable options.\u00a0\n\"It's been very prevalent in urban centres across Canada, and Yellowknife is no different,\" Catling said. \"Developers are looking to build denser, more affordable options and demand is showing that those units are accessible to young people moving into the housing market.\"\nCatling said a\u00a02018 CMHC report on the northern housing market found demand for condos across the region is growing stronger, driven by their affordability and\u00a0shorter construction time.\nMarie Coe, a Yellowknife real estate agent with Coldwell Banker, said one of the keys to selling a unit like this would be keeping the condo fees down.\u00a0\n\"[Fees are]\u00a0a sore spot but people still like to have those apartments-style condos where they're what we call, 'worry free,'\" said Coe.\n\"You don't have to worry about snow removal, you don't have to worry about how the heating works, or anything, you just go into the place and open your door and that's it.\"\nGuy, the developer, said he hopes relying on the city's electrical grid for utilities including heating and the low maintenance cost for electric vehicles will keep condo fees low.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605092419855", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605798467797", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605805635878", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1605092419855", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Robyn Urback", "title": "What's the difference between the Conservative and Liberal platforms?

I'm not talking about Ottawa-obsessed political wonks and media types who are required to pore over the fine print, but real Canadians who aren't obliged to watch Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau twirl around in a canoe, or Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer blandly state his indignation.\nBoth camps, at various stages over the past couple of weeks, have lamented that there hasn't been enough focus on policy so far this campaign. This is a complaint typically hauled out when your guy isn't looking too great for whatever reason \u2014 like when Scheer\u00a0appeared\u00a0with an anti-abortion-activist-turned-candidate right at the start of the campaign, or when Trudeau told Canadians he couldn't recall exactly how many times in the past he wore blackface.\nWhy isn't anyone talking about the issues?\u00a0they whine\u00a0to an electorate that now can't get the\u00a0Banana Boat Song\u00a0out of their heads.\u00a0Let's talk about things that matter.\nIn reality, neither party genuinely wants to talk about policy, because policy isn't going to win this election. How can it? Both parties are essentially offering the same things, with a few small differences largely imperceptible to the casual observer who probably has far better things to do than obsess over the details.\nFor example, both the Conservatives and Liberals have interpreted \"affordable housing\" to essentially mean \"accessible home-buying,\" and thus, have offered incentives to help Canadians get into the housing market. (The NDP's\u00a0plan, to its credit, is actually about helping families find affordable places to live, not buy, though the party hasn't said\u00a0precisely how it will pay for it.)\nThe Liberals' plan is to offer buyers money up front in exchange for a chunk of the equity; the Conservatives' is to loosen stress test requirements and extend the maximum length of a mortgage. Yet neither plan\u00a0is actually geared toward relieving the pressure in hot housing markets like Toronto and Vancouver, and both, by further incentivizing buying, could very well make it more expensive to find a place to live.\u00a0\nSo both parties are promising more money in our pockets through tax cuts: the Conservatives by cutting the rate on taxable income under $47,630 from 15 to 13.75 per cent, and the Liberals, by raising the basic personal income tax deduction\u00a0from $12,069\u00a0to $15,000 for those earning less than $147,000. The Liberal plan will do more to lift low-income Canadians out of poverty, according to analysis by B.C. economist Kevin Milligan, but for median-income households, the\u00a0impact\u00a0will be roughly the same.\nBoth Scheer and Trudeau have announced\u00a0incentives\u00a0to retrofit your home through either an interest-free loan (Liberals) or refundable tax credits (Conservatives). On climate, the Liberals will keep a carbon tax that is\u00a0too low\u00a0to change consumer behaviour, and the Conservatives will implement what is essentially a carbon price on heavy emitters, without setting clear reduction targets.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth promise to tackle gun violence. Neither will balance the budget in the next four years. Both have promised to make maternity and paternity leave\u00a0tax-free. Neither will touch supply management or government bailouts of big business.\u00a0\nAnd on the one major policy difference that could actually drive a policy wedge between voters \u2014 pharmacare \u2014 the Liberals, who\u00a0came out guns blazing on the file before the campaign (notably, during the\u00a0height\u00a0of the SNC-Lavalin saga), have been\u00a0conspicuously reserved.\u00a0\nBeyond that, the Liberal and Conservative platforms are virtually interchangeable; they hardly lay out the framework for dramatically different Canadas. Your choice is between tax cuts or tax cuts, a weak or weaker climate plan, interest-free loans or tax credits, and maybe drug coverage, depending on the details, if this promise doesn't go the way of\u00a0electoral reform.\u00a0\nThat's why so much of the war room-generated focus is on the leaders themselves: Justin Trudeau as two-faced and unethical, and Andrew Scheer as the right-wing lovechild of Doug Ford and Stephen Harper.\nIndeed,\u00a0success for the Liberals will mean convincing voters that Scheer will implement harsh austerity measures, new abortion regulations and that Canada is one bad prime minister away from a U.S.-style\u00a0gun crisis.\nFor the Conservatives, it will mean persuading voters that Trudeau is lawless and privileged, and that he will bankrupt Canada with his excessive spending. It has nothing to do with policy, and everything to do with personality.\nIt's a crummy way to decide an election, but perhaps the only way when the biggest difference between the platforms is their colours.\u00a0\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

However, we must do our part, and the government will oversee this collective effort,\" Girard said in an advance copy of his budget speech.\nThe government also renewed a popular tax rebate for the purchase of electric cars, dubbed Roulez Vert, and a program (Chauffez Vert) to encourage homeowners to switch to a renewable energy heating system.\nBut Quebec will still need to substantially cut emissions in the transportation sector in order to meet its 2030 target.\nCurrently, about 44 per cent of Quebec's greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport sector, especially fossil fuel-burning cars and trucks.\nPatrick Bonin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace Canada, said the budget doesn't contain enough measures to curb emissions, and devotes too much money to building roads, as opposed to expanding public transit.\n\"Overall, when you look at what is on the table, it's far from what is needed to counter the climate emergency,\" he said. \"We're quite skeptical that Quebec is on the way to meeting the targets of the Paris accord.\"\nMontreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante, who has made fighting climate change key to her own mandate, said she was \"pleased to witness an important shift\" toward public transit. But she also said she was disappointed that the government did not commit to build any new social housing in the city as its vacancy rate hits a 15-year low.\n\"We cannot ignore the immediate housing needs of thousands of Montrealers,\" Plante said.\nWATCH: Finance minister breaks\u00a0down the budget by the numbers\nThe budget was tabled in the midst of global economic uncertainty, sparked by fears of the coronavirus and volatile oil prices.\nQuebec projected GDP growth to drop to two per cent in the coming year, down from 2.8 per cent in 2019. It expects growth to drop further, to 1.5 per cent in 2021.\nBut Girard's budget was prepared before stock prices dropped dramatically on Monday.\nA line in the document acknowledges the COVID-19 epidemic could hinder economic growth, but otherwise maintains Quebec's finances make it \"resilient to economic disruptions.\"\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Girard said the province is prepared for any impact on the economy or the health-care system.\n\"We will see what the evolution of the virus is,\" he said.\nCarlos Leit\u00e3o, the finance critic for the Liberals, said the budget \"lacked prudence.\"\nHe said the two per cent growth forecast was aggressive given global uncertainty, and that the budget didn't contain sufficient \"provisions for risks.\"\nHe suggested a \"mini-budget\" could even be necessary in the coming months to address the lack of foresight seen in Tuesday's plan.\nHere are some other key takeaways.\nMore cash is being put into the province's crumbling infrastructure. The amount in the province's 10-year infrastructure plan will increase by $15.1 billion, to a total of $130.5 billion.\nIn all, the plan devoted $15.8 billion for public transportation projects in six cities across the province, including Montreal's light-rail network, an extension of the Metro's Blue line and the possible extension of the Yellow line. There was no mention of adding a new Pink line to the network, an idea long championed by Plante.\nThe road network, meanwhile, was allotted $26.8 billion. Environmental groups had pressed the Legault government to devote equal money to roads and public transit.\u00a0\nImprovements to education infrastructure, such as schools, was allocated $25.5 billion, while health and social services got $20.5 billion.\nDespite the focus on the environment, the biggest spending areas in the provincial budget remain health care and education.\nEducation spending is going up by 4.5 per cent, while health-care expenditures are increasing by 5.3 per cent.\nIn education, the CAQ says it will add 350 more pre-kindergarten\u00a0classes for four-year-olds, bringing the total to more than 1,000. The government will also put $126 million toward helping students with special needs, and promised 6,000 more subsidized daycare spaces within two years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of the new health-care money is going toward improving primary care services. But it also includes a commitment to add 900 beds to long-term care facilities, and $450 million over five years to hire more staff in the province's beleaguered youth protection system.\nThe CAQ moved closer to standardizing the school tax rate across the province, which was a key election promise. That means homeowners in certain regions will save hundreds in the coming year. Someone who owns a $275,000 condo in Montreal, for instance, will eventually save $182 compared to the 2018 rate, while someone who owns the same priced home in Mauricie will save $509.\nThe CAQ also created a new tax credit to encourage businesses to invest in innovation \u2014\u00a0at a cost of $526 million over five years.\nThe CAQ set aside $200 million over five years for Indigenous peoples. This money is aimed at following through on the recommendations of the Viens commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\nThe promise came with few specifics, but Girard said that was by design. He said Indigenous groups should determine their funding priorities.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2416845822", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Biden clashes with Warren, Sanders on health care in 3rd Democratic debate", "description": "Candidates pare back some of the bickering that marked 2 earlier debates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/democrats-debate-houston-1.5281583", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5281950.1568336171!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-election-debate.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2019 7:26 PM ET", "2019-09-13T02:50:51.692Z"], "source": null, "content": "Democratic U.S. presidential front-runner Joe Biden clashed with progressive challengers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on health care in a debate on Thursday, defending Obamacare and challenging them to be honest about the cost of their plans.\nWith the top 10 Democratic candidates sharing the debate stage for the first time in Houston, Texas, the contenders spent more time expressing their shared opposition to Republican President Donald Trump and pared back some of the bickering that marked the first two debates this summer.\nBut the Democrats quickly renewed their battle over health care, the issue that has ignited the most heated debates in the campaign for the party's nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.\nBiden, who served as vice-president for eight years under Barack Obama, said he would build on his landmark health-care law, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and accused Warren and Sanders of wanting to tear it down with Medicare for All, a government-run health-care plan that would eliminate private insurance.\n\"I know that the senator says she's for Bernie.

That has some advocates calling on government to afford renters affected by the COVID-19 outbreak extra protection and support, while others are looking to apartment owners for compassion and compromise.\nFor Willy Scholten, president of the New Brunswick Apartment Owners' Association, the expectation is that tenants will pay.\n\"We still have the same obligations that we've had in the past. We have to pay our expenses and continue to employ our people, pay maintenance, pay the operating costs, pay our mortgage payments,\" Scholten said.\n\"Our expectation is that rent will be paid when it's due.\"\nThat aligns with comments from Premier Blaine Higgs shortly after declaring the state of emergency March 19. As part of the measures, the province suspended the right of landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent until May 31.\n\"We are not saying tenants don't have to pay rent,\" Higgs said at the time. \"They absolutely do. We're simply asking for flexibility that may be required as people and businesses lose income.\"\nThe \"flexibility\" will have to be negotiated by tenants and landlords on a case-by-case basis. Scholten said the association does not control its members, who set their own policies.\nAsked what could happen if tenants do not pay, Scholten said: \"Everything is completely uncertain at this point. We don't know what's going to happen.\"\nHe said owners expect tenants eligible for government financial aid to use those supports.\u00a0\nIn New Brunswick, the government will provide a one-time income supplement of $900 for workers or small business owners who lost their income on March 15 or after. The first payments could be delivered later this week.\nThe federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit offers income support for up to 16 weeks \u2014 about $2,000 a month \u2014 to those who lose pay because of the pandemic. The application process is set to open in early April, with support to come about 10 days later.\nThose aid packages won't be available in time for Wednesday and they fail to help some low-income workers and people living on social assistance beyond a bump in the GST rebate,\u00a0 according to Jean-Claude Basque, provincial co-ordinator for the New Brunswick Common Front for Social Justice.\nHis organization is proposing government waive rent payments during the crisis for anyone living in New Brunswick Housing or non-profit social housing. They're also calling for the Department of Social Development to reinstate 75 rent subsidies that were cut in December.\u00a0\n\"They have a lot of difficulty in the best of times to have a decent life and now with the crisis certainly they're being impacted a lot,\" Basque said.\nOn a broader scale, the group wants apartment owners to reduce rent payments by 25 per cent per month during the crisis.\u00a0\nBasque said owners were given a boost in the latest provincial budget with news the non-owner-occupied residential property tax will be cut in half over a four-year period, and now, he said, is a time to give back.\n\"Government and everybody is saying we're all in this together, which is true, but then we're asking the province and the federal [government] to do their part to help our tax system, to help people,\" Basque said.\u00a0\n\"But the private sector also has to do their part. They're going to receive all kinds of money to help either their business or help their employees. But they have to do their part also.\"\nEligible businesses and non-profit organizations will receive wage subsidies up to 75 per cent, retroactive March 15, Ottawa announced. Interest-free loans of up to $40,000 will also be available to\u00a0small businesses and not-for-profits in order to to help cover operating costs.\nBasque advises anyone concerned about paying rent to speak to their MLA.\nOpposition MLAs say the provincial government should consider doing more for tenants and landlords.\u00a0\nLiberal MLA Lisa Harris, Opposition critic for Social Development, said New Brunswick could look to other provinces.\n\"Nova Scotia is also helping landlords with a rent deferral program where they agree to defer rent for businesses that have had to shut down and the province will cover rent that can't be recovered,\" Harris said in a statement to CBC News.\n\"In BC, there's a program that offers $500 to cover the cost of rent. We think more can be done in New Brunswick.\"\nGreen Leader David Coon said provincial and federal officials should work with banks on a mortgage-deferral program, which would release some of the pressure on apartment owners.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe province must suspend rent increases, he added.\nCoon hopes tenants can manage to make rent with government aid they receive, but he said the province will have to deal with the question of what happens once the crisis is over, the no-eviction order is lifted and tenants have accumulated debt to their landlords \u2014 a debt that can't be paid all at once.\nIt's a concern for Basque, who wonders how tenants can be protected from retaliation once the pandemic and lockdown has passed.\n\"We don't have a tenants' association like other provinces, so we rely on government action or on owners of apartments to do the right thing and we hope they won't kick people out, for sure,\" he said.\nThe co-founders of Damage Deposit Refunds, a Saint John business that assists tenants in getting money entitled to them from their landlord, are pitching a compromise to address the issue.\nElizabeth Vickers and Loai Jaouni say illegal pet fees collected by some apartment owners for years that are now owed to tenants could be deducted from rent payments.\u00a0\n\"That would reduce the amount of money they would owe the tenant and it would acknowledge that they owe the tenant that money,\" said Vickers.\n\"It would allow the tenant to still pay some of their rent. It would be a reduced amount, but then the landlord would receive hopefully enough to cover his mortgage and electric or whatever their arrangement was.\"\nJaouni said that could be a workable solution, but he hopes to see compassion from owners for affected tenants already shown in places like Prince Edward Island, where one landlord waived rent entirely, and in Wisconsin, where the landlord lowered rent to $100.\n\"I don't think they should bring the price down because of the illegal fees, if landlords want to be nice enough, like the landlord in Wisconsin,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"That should be a separate thing because of the situation we're in with COVID-19.\"\n"}, {"author": "Laura Kane", "title": "B.C. posts $1.5B operating surplus as tax revenue increases and real estate market cools", "description": "Province eliminates operating debt for 1st time in 4 decades", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-finances-operating-surplus-1.5217333", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5023999.1550534192!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/carole-james.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 18, 2019 4:32 PM PT", "2019-07-19T00:41:42.480Z"], "source": null, "content": "The British Columbia government ended its fiscal year with an operating surplus of $1.5 billion\u00a0as the province collected more revenue from taxation and less money from a softening real estate market.\nThe 2018-19 public accounts released Thursday by Finance Minister Carole James show that the surplus was some $1.3 billion higher than anticipated, driven by $2.9 billion in increased revenue primarily from personal and corporate income taxes.\nJames said she was not concerned about a $315-million reduction in property transfer tax revenue. She said the previous Liberal government relied on an out-of-control real estate market to grow resources, while her NDP government has a long-term economic plan.\n\"In fact, my bigger worry that I certainly had coming in as finance minister, is the worry of running an economy based on a speculative real estate market and skyrocketing housing prices, which meant that people couldn't build their lives here in British Columbia,\" she said.\n\"That's part of the reason that we're investing, as you can see, in education, in child care, in making sure that we have people who are able to get back into the workforce and that families have opportunities here, because we believe that'll create the long-term sustainable growth that we need.\"\nJames said the increased revenue reflected economic growth, household income growth and higher income tax assessments, not just government intervention. But the province also raked in millions from new taxes, including the employer health tax, which brought in $415 million.\nThe public accounts also revealed that the province has eliminated its operating debt for the first time in 40 years and that the taxpayer-supported debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is 14.5 per cent, the lowest it has been in a decade.\nJames said her budget in 2018 put B.C. on a different path with record investments of $1 billion for child care and $7 billion for affordable housing.\nHer government has also chosen to confront financial challenges at the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia and BC Hydro, and both Crown corporations are now on a more sustainable path, she said.\n\"ICBC is still running at a loss, but we are starting to see some small improvements, although a great deal of work still needs to happen,\" she said.\nB.C.'s economy grew by an estimated 2.4 per cent in the 2018 calendar year, the third highest rate in the country, led by goods-producing industries with notable gains in mining, oil and gas extraction, construction and manufacturing, the public accounts showed.\nB.C. had the lowest unemployment rate in Canada at 4.7 per cent in 2018, down from 5.1 per cent the year before. Wage and salary growth also led the country at 5.9 per cent in 2018.\nShirley Bond, finance co-critic for the Opposition Liberals, said the government's numerous new or increased taxes are having a devastating impact on British Columbians, while their government refuses to lay out an economic or jobs plan.\n\"The NDP government's primary source of revenue continues to be the pockets of taxpayers,\" she said in a statement.\nBond, who represents the riding of Prince George-Valemount, noted the public accounts reflect last year's numbers and there are serious concerns about economic challenges ahead. Revenues were largely driven by federal transfers, which are expected to go down next year, she said, adding that the public auto insurer lost $1.2 billion.\nThe government's \"failed\" tax policies are beginning to drive B.C.'s competitiveness backwards, said Liberal finance co-critic Tracy Redies.\n\"As our housing sector struggles, with housing starts down and construction projects coming to a halt, and businesses continue to raise alarm bells about the province's deteriorating competitiveness, the NDP clearly has no plan for our economy and how to ensure it can provide hard-working British Columbians the opportunities they deserve.\"\n"}, {"author": "Gabriela Panza-Beltrandi", "title": "This N.W.T.-built home could cut energy bills by almost half, says not-for-profit", "description": "Bruce Elliott is building his 1st energy efficient home, hopes to send some to High Arctic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/energy-efficient-house-nwt-1.5377737", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5377764.1575056487!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bruce-elliott.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Nov 29, 2019 12:00 PM CT", "2019-11-29T20:15:18.644Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From the outside, it looks like just another house; but if you lived there, you could save a pretty penny on energy.\u00a0\nThe structure stands, still under construction, on the Fiberglass North property in Kam Lake, Yellowknife.\n\"These houses should be able to provide their own energy with solar for 10 months of the year,\" explained Bruce Elliott, the owner of Fiberglass North, as he shows CBC\u00a0News inside the two-bedroom unit he and his team are working on.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's the first home\u00a0he's ever built.\u00a0\nElliott is building and selling energy efficient homes he designed.

Eighty-six per cent reported spending more than 30 per cent of their income on housing.\nHetherington pointed out that\u00a040 per cent of survey respondents had completed post-secondary education.\n\"Residents of Toronto and Mississauga are struggling with food insecurity regardless of their education levels,\" the report says.\nThe report notes that food costs have increased by 7.5 per cent in Toronto, compared to four per cent across Canada, and of the people surveyed, 87 per cent said they changed their shopping and consumption habits because of the increase in food prices.\u00a0\nRespondents said they shopped at discounted grocery stores, used coupons, bought only items on sale, reduced the amount of food they bought and bought more affordable but less quality food, and increased their use of food banks.\nThe top three reasons that respondents skipped meals were having to pay for rent, phone bills and transportation.\u00a0\nThe report says debt was the only way that many respondents could survive, and 37 per cent reported borrowing from friends or family, 31 per cent reported using a credit card, 12 per cent reported using a payday lender and 10 per cent reported using a line of credit.\n\"When coping strategies are not sufficient enough to make ends meet, people in the Toronto region can turn to a food bank to help fulfil their basic needs,\" the report reads.\nThe report calls on governments to: strengthen social assistance; support low-income households by expanding tax benefits and creating ways out of poverty; invest in affordable housing and tenant protections; improve\u00a0access to affordable childcare; make a commitment to ensure there is access to \"affordable, nutritious, [and] culturally appropriate\" food in every community; keep\u00a0human rights in mind when making decisions to ensure policies are equitable.\nThe Daily Break Food Bank surveys food bank use every year to track trends, and this year the Mississauga Food Bank joined the agency in the survey to provide a broader snapshot of the problem in the GTA.\u00a0\nThe food banks pulled information from a database called Link2Feed to track the number of visits.\u00a0They surveyed people at 51 food banks across Toronto and Mississauga from late February to mid-May in 2019, using a 44-question survey.\nIn total, 1,403 surveys were collected and 1,326 were deemed sufficiently completed to be included in the analysis.\n"}, {"author": "Nick Purdon & Leonardo Palleja", "title": "'We're everywhere now': Meet the homeless in Canada's largest city", "description": "'It's people who have fallen on hard times, got divorced, lost their jobs, got a work injury'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/homeless-in-toronto-1.5400781", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5400861.1576860501!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/frenchie.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 26, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-26T13:27:05.402Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "In a given year, 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness.\nThat's a population the size of a small city.\u00a0\nIn Toronto, activists say there have never been so many people without a place to call their own.\u00a0They use the word \"epidemic.\"\nAccording to the Toronto Homeless Memorial Network, a group that tracks deaths among the homeless, 17 have died in Toronto since the beginning of October 2019.\nThe thing is, when people talk about the homeless it's often in terms of numbers and statistics like the ones above \u2014\u00a0but the issue really hits home when you meet the people.\u00a0\nThe National's\u00a0Leonardo Palleja and Nick Purdon\u00a0spent time\u00a0with a number of homeless people in Toronto. Here are some of their\u00a0stories:\nFor six months, Frenchie (he says that's what his friends call him) has slept in a tent under a bridge in Toronto \u2014\u00a0a few blocks from some of the most expensive houses in the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrenchie says he lost his restaurant job and had some bad luck, and after that things went downhill.\u00a0\n\"It's a difficult life, but we survive. Every day we survive,\" he says.\nThere are about 15 other people living in the makeshift camp under the bridge, a small community where he says he's treated well. Above ground, on the street, he says people judge him.\n\"I just want to say to people, we are not that bad,\" he says. \"We have a different life, but we are still human \u2014 we are not alien, we are still people.\"\nIt's hard to know exactly how many Canadians sleep outside on a given night, but the best estimate is around 35,000 individuals.\nFrenchie says he doesn't worry that much about winter \u2014 he has plenty of tarps and blankets, and sometimes he lights a small fire in his tent to keep warm.\u00a0\nHear more from Frenchie:\nAt 43, Paul has been homeless for six years \u2014\u00a0ever since he lost his job framing houses in Toronto.\n\"I had a work injury and I also suffer from depression,\" he explains.\u00a0\nWhat's remarkable about Paul is that if you passed him on the street, you probably wouldn't realize he's homeless. He doesn't fit the stereotypical image of an entrenched homeless person many people imagine when they read statistics about the problem in Canada.\u00a0\nLike the one that says 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness in any given year.\n\"It's not just the bums you see on the streets \u2014\u00a0we're everywhere now,\" Paul says.\u00a0\n\"The vast majority don't look like they're homeless. It's people who have fallen on hard times, got divorced, lost their jobs, got a work injury,\" he says.\u00a0\nPaul says he's lucky to have a bed at one of the city's shelters\u00a0while he's on a waiting list for subsidized housing.\u00a0\nA list that is 11 years long.\n\"We're a rich country, there's no reason for this to be happening,\" he says.\nPaul says not having a place to call his own takes a tremendous toll on his mind.\u00a0\n\"You have no hopes and dreams left anymore. You have no nothing,\" he says. \"People think you are nothing, and so you end up thinking you are nothing.\n\"You just eventually end up fading, fading away slowly.\"\u00a0\nHear more from Paul:\nKevin Durance has become an unlikely activist.\u00a0\nHe fidgets on stage as he addresses a protest in front of Toronto city hall.\u00a0\n\"I know how hard I have to work just to survive,\" he tells the crowd.\u00a0\nDurance has lived in a Toronto homeless shelter for the past six years. He knows how bad the situation is on the street, and he wants the city to declare a state of emergency and open more beds to the homeless.\u00a0\n\"It boils down to real humanity,\" he says. \"We've got to start caring about people.\"\nActivists insist high rent prices in Toronto make it hard for people who earn minimum wage or collect social assistance to afford a place to live.\u00a0\nThe number of people sleeping in shelters in Toronto has doubled in the past five years and now hovers somewhere around 8,000.\nStill, Kevin's wish is a small one \u2014\u00a0for people to see him and not look away when they pass him on the street.\u00a0\n\"They don't see me, they see that stigma. [They think] I'm violent, I'm strange, I'm different \u2014 I'm just simple. I need someone to help me.\"\nHear more from Kevin:\nScott used to run a small hotel in downtown Toronto.\u00a0\nThe day that closed, he lost both his job and his place to live.\nHe never thought he'd find himself living in a shelter.\n\"I always had money, I always had a job,\" he says. \"It's getting to the point where I'm getting too old to get a job and my physical features aren't what they used to be. Who wants to hire somebody with no teeth to go serve tables?\"\nScott hasn't told his friends or family that he's staying in a shelter, saying \"I don't want pity.\"\nHe says all he wants is to get back to work full-time and have a place of his own.\n\"Just get back up there where I used to be, where I get up in the morning and I've got a place to go.\"\nHear more from Scott:\u00a0\nWATCH | The National's feature and learn from those living it what it's like to be homeless in Toronto:\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "Housing bill threatens funds for parks and rec, city fears", "description": "Bill 108 meant to spur new homes, but Ottawa sees 'one-size-fits-all' solution", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/city-ottawa-letter-ontario-housing-bill-feedback-1.5144555", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5147122.1558643448!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/millennium-park-in-orleans.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 24, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-05-24T17:34:01.490Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Ottawa has drafted a letter to the Ontario government asking it to remove\u00a0parts of a sweeping housing bill that could make it more difficult for the city to build new parks and recreation centres.\u00a0\nOntario tabled its More Homes, More Choice\u00a0omnibus bill on May 2.\nThe bill changes how municipalities are\u00a0allowed to collect money from developers for so-called \"soft services\"\u00a0such as libraries, recreation centres and parks.\n\"I cannot imagine the Richcraft\u00a0[Recreation Complex in Kanata] being built under this model. I can't imagine Millennium Park [in Orl\u00e9ans] necessarily coming forward the way it's being built,\" planning and infrastructure general manager Steve Willis\u00a0told Ottawa's planning committee on Tuesday.\nAccording to staff's interpretation of the bill, the city would no longer be able to save up development charges to pay for large projects.\n\"I would wish to be wrong about that, but that's why we highlighted this as one of the most significant issues... because it applies to every single ward every single community throughout the city,\" Willis said.\nThe letter needs to be endorsed by council and signed by the mayor at the June 12 council meeting.\nIt explains\u00a0how the city agrees with the PC government's overall idea of boosting housing supply, but is concerned a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution will have a \"negative effect\" on communities outside the Greater Toronto Area.\nThe letter says it's \"contrary to the spirit of streamlining\" to ask\u00a0the city to come up with an entirely separate process to collect new \"community benefit\"\u00a0charges, instead of sticking with the\u00a0existing system of development charges.\nThe new system would be especially problematic because the new community benefit fee would be set at a percentage of a land's value\u00a0\u2014 and land is worth much more in the GTA than elsewhere.\n\"So any community that doesn't have Toronto-area land values will end up with a much lower amount of money we're allowed to collect, yet it costs us the same amount of money to build an ambulance post as it does in the City of Toronto,\" Willis pointed out.\nThe city also worries the Ontario bill will mean it collects less revenue through\u00a0development charges\u00a0to pay for new infrastructure, and\u00a0argues in the letter that Ottawa's fees, set at\u00a0five to seven per cent of the price of new house, are \"reasonable\".\nIn a rare move, council will also be asked to send representatives to Queen's Park to\u00a0make the\u00a0case in person if Bill 108 is debated at a\u00a0standing committee. Those officials could include planning committee chair\u00a0Jan Harder and rural affairs chair Eli El-Chantiry, along with Willis and city lawyers.\nMayor Jim Watson will also be asked to invite Steve Clark, the\u00a0Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, to Ottawa for a face-to-face meeting to discuss Ottawa's concerns about the housing bill.\nClark said his ministry wants\u00a0municipalities to have a \"vital revenue stream\" to build communities that have all the facilities they need.\nThe proposed new community benefits system, he explained by email, \"takes the politics out of planning.\"\nOne tool that cities use, in particular,\u00a0has been criticized for its lack of transparency. Section 37 of the Planning Act allows them to negotiate with developers for money in exchange for granting taller buildings. The City of Ottawa also counts on collecting fees\u00a0and a certain proportion of parkland (or money) from each development. All three tools are\u00a0affected by the new bill.\n\"We are consulting on the best way to replace the current system of 'let's make a deal'\u00a0planning with a system that puts people and communities first.

We've changed how we talk about gender, global politics, drugs and what it means to be a Canadian.\nHere's how the discourse has evolved around several topics that define this country and the people who live here:\nIn 2011 a Toronto couple sparked a frenzy when they decided not to reveal the sex of their baby, Storm.\n\"The level of vitriol was outstanding,\" said May Friedman, a professor specializing in gender identity at Ryerson University, noting people lashed out in person and online at the couple.\nOver the last five years, that concept slowly started becoming more acceptable.\n\"I still wouldn't say it's a common move, but in downtown urban centres it's not completely outlandish like it was perceived as being in 2011, which was really not a long time ago.\"\nFriedman said there was a clear tipping point in the middle of the decade where trans and gender fluid people were visible enough in media and where being trans, and lessening the importance of gender norms to your children, stopped being considered a radical idea.\nToday, people put their pronouns in their email signatures, and many bathrooms make a point of welcoming anyone who identifies as a man or woman to use them. Some places drop gendered washrooms altogether.\nBut Friedman said there's still progress to be made, especially when it comes to transgender people of colour, who may not always be as visible or represented in the media as white LGBTQ people.\nThe addiction epidemic started with the over-prescribing of opioids near the start of the decade and worsened with a supply of synthetic street drugs like carfentanil and fentanyl, which only need tiny amounts to trigger a deadly overdose.\n\"The opioid crisis is without a doubt the single biggest public health crisis of our generation,\" said Benjamin Perrin, the author of Overdose: Heartbreak and Hope in Canada's Opioid Crisis,\u00a0a book set to be released next year about the epidemic.\nRecent figures from the Public Health Agency of Canada show nearly 14,000 people have been killed by opioids since 2016, and Perrin said approximately one person dies from an overdose every two hours.\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more to combat the crisis, including creating more supervised consumption sites and giving doctors more authority to prescribe alternatives to street drugs.\nHowever, he said that decriminalizing all drugs isn't the \"panacea\"\u00a0to the crisis.\nWhen \"Thank Me Later\" came out in 2010, few could have known that the Canadian artist \u2014\u00a0described at the time on review site Pitchfork as \"emo-y\" \u2014\u00a0could have become one of the world's most dominant artists. He was the most-streamed artist of the decade on\u00a0Spotify, and his music helped put Toronto on the map as a city with a hip-hop identity.\n\"Perhaps above all, however, is his ability to appeal to a wide variety of fans who might identify with various aspects of his multi-faceted persona,\" said Ken McLeod, an associate professor of musicology at University of Toronto.\n\"Over the past decade where streaming services have broadened musical tastes, and where ethnic and musical diversity are increasingly valorized, he metaphorically sits in the middle of a cultural and stylistic Venn diagram.\"\nHome prices have more than doubled since the start of the decade, outpacing income by a large margin and putting home ownership out of reach for many young people in two of Canada's biggest cities, says John Pasalis, president of real estate site Realosophy.\nBack in 2010, Pasalis estimates housing prices in Toronto were about five times more than average yearly income, whereas now they're roughly eight times more. He said the situation is similar in Vancouver.\n\"Today's generation of first-time buyers is battling with sky-high rents and a market that is a lot harder to get into than ten years ago,\" said Pasalis. \"It's harder to save and it's harder to get into the market.\"\nMarket control measures from governments have had mixed impact. Pasalis said in Toronto, a mortgage stress test led more people to buy condos and vastly inflated their pricing. In Vancouver, a foreign buyer's tax has softened the market, but prices there are still sky-high.\nMadness appeared to spread across Canada over the Raptors' 2019 playoff run. When the Raptors started their finals series against the Golden State Warriors, thousands of people across the country crowded into dozens of outdoor screenings.\nBut it took much of the decade to build such fanfare \u2014\u00a0after all, in 2011 the Raptors finished with the second-worst season record in the Eastern Conference.\nGeneral Manager Masai Ujiri made gutsy moves towards building the team,\u00a0firing head coach Dwane Casey and sending DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio in a trade that landed the team Kawhi Leonard.\nThe Raptors' feverish playoff following indicates that basketball is beginning to rival hockey as the nation's most popular sport, said Laurel Walzak, a sport media assistant professor at Ryerson University.\nBut the lasting memory will be of the Raptors' playoff run, and more than a million fans celebrating their championship in Toronto in June.\n\"I don't think this can ever be repeated in any sport moving forward. This was a true uniting of global fans and a true uniting of Canada,\" said Walzak.\nThe last decade has cemented the possibility of China becoming the world's dominant economy, and the implications of that haven't been lost on Canada.\nThe two Canadian prime ministers this decade have had vastly different approaches to relations with the East Asian country, said Lynette Ong, a University of Toronto professor specializing in Chinese politics.\n\"The Harper government did not have China as a priority either as a trade partner or in foreign policy. Trudeau's government, in his first term, swung the pendulum in the other direction with strong engagement with China,\" said Ong.\nCanada has recently been caught in the middle of a controversy with China after carrying out the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of telecom company Huawei, at the request of the U.S.\nChina then detained two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, in what was widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Meng.\nDespite current tensions, Ong sees potential benefits in the rise of China.\n\"There is a great deal of complementarity between the two countries, and hence significant scope of gains from trade,\" she said. \"If we are able to effectively manage the risks, Canada stands to gain a lot from trading with China.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Believe it or not, people in N.L. are in better economic shape than you might think", "description": "Annual report from MUN's Harris Centre released Wednesday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nl-vital-signs-report-2019-economic-silver-lining-1.5349708", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5350234.1573066541!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rob-greenwood-vital-signs-2019.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 06, 2019 5:27 PM NT", "2019-11-06T20:57:46.786Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "It's the dominant economic narrative in Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0\u2014 the doom and gloom of the province's finances, and the hardships faced by residents.\nAnd while there are\u00a0certainly lots of statistics in the provincial Vital Signs Report 2019 that reinforce those sentiments, the report, released Wednesday, also offers glimmers of hope.\nThe average family income in 2017 was $81,000, says the report \u2014 an 18 per cent jump in the past 10 years, and the largest increase among all Canadian provinces in that time frame.\nAdditionally, the average number of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians on income support has decreased eight per cent in the last eight years, with 32,811 people receiving such assistance in 2018.\n\"Some of the stats are actually showing we're better off than some of the public sentiment you hear,\" said Rob Greenwood, director of Memorial University's Harris Centre.\nThe Harris Centre\u00a0produces the annual report along with the Community Foundation of NL, conglomerating statistics and facts from a swath of sectors into a document delivered to homes and organizations across the province.\nThe report also highlights\u00a0housing affordability, with the average price in N.L.\u00a0half that of the Canadian average.

There's good and bad in all these angles,\" he said, pointing to the report's\u00a0tallying of the number of residents who live in poverty, which sits at\u00a013 per cent of the population.\nAnd looking at the snapshot of provincial government finances doesn't give much to cheer about, as the report notes public sector debt has ballooned in the last five years, from $12 billion in 2015 to $23 billion in 2019.\nThat debt comes from a number of sources within the government, including its Crown corporations and agencies\u00a0\u2014 like Nalcor, which is in charge of the\u00a0overbudget beast of a hydroelectric project that is Muskrat Falls.\nAnother dubious point of distinction is the net provincial\u00a0debt, projected to come in for the 2019/20 year at $15.4 billion, well above the $10.3-billion net debt in 2014/15.\nWhile those numbers are as enormous as they are alarming, Greenwood said assembling the statistics can\u00a0help propel change.\nA fantastic metaphor for understanding demographics; if NL were a village of 100 people... <a href=\"https://t.co/mfdXkgQHH2\">pic.twitter.com/mfdXkgQHH2</a>\n\"As they say, what's measured is managed,\" he said.\n\"Vital Signs doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but it's forcing us to think about these issues in more detail.\"\n2019 is the sixth year for the report, which\u00a0can be accessed online.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Federal NDP leader Singh makes stop in Edmonton, party's lone Alberta riding", "description": "Edmonton-Strathcona is the lone riding for the federal NDP", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/ndp-jagmeet-singh-edmonton-campaign-1.5259122", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5259132.1566691825!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jagmeet-singh.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 24, 2019 7:01 PM MT", "2019-08-25T01:01:38.303Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh visited the party's lone riding in Alberta on Saturday in an effort to build momentum in the province ahead of the fall election.\nThe New Democrats have failed to translate strong support for the Alberta NDP into gains at the federal level.

And I think that's wrong\u00a0and I think that's unfair, so I want to build a more sustainable economy.\"\nThe NDP\u00a0is\u00a0promising to create 300,000 green new jobs as part of a $15-billion climate change strategy.\nThe platform is not costed out, but Singh said it has been sent to the office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer for an independent review.\nMcPherson, the local candidate, is tasked with holding Edmonton-Strathcona in the upcoming election after the departure of Duncan.\n\"From what we can tell from all the door-knocking we've been doing is that the support is really strong,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "With real estate market booming, Montreal property assessments climb 13.7%", "description": "Beaconsfield, Hampstead,\u00a0Mount Royal, Kirkland and Westmount among those with biggest jumps", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-property-assessments-2020-1.5278986", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279351.1568220053!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-montreal.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 11, 2019 10:24 AM ET", "2019-09-11T18:28:21.056Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Montreal homeowners will see a major\u00a0increase in their property assessment, propelled by the city's booming real estate market.\nOn average, residential and non-residential property values\u00a0are going up 13.7 per cent, the city announced Wednesday.\nThe new assessments will take effect Jan. 1, 2020 and cover the next three years.

Elizabeth Clarke, chair of the community services committee.\nThe latest edition of the Nutritious Food Basket\u00a0report\u00a0shows the weekly cost of healthy food is now at $202.29 per week for a family of four in the region. That's an increase of $40.49 per month since the survey was last done in 2017.\nThe food basket is a\u00a0tool\u00a0that public health officials use to calculate\u00a0the local cost of an ideal\u00a0basket\u00a0of healthy food for different household\u00a0sizes. It's then compared to the cost of housing, to see how easy it is for families to afford their basic necessities.\nIn Waterloo region, Clarke said the cost of rent has gone up nine\u00a0per cent in the last two years, and people are having a harder time making ends meet.\n\"We're certainly not seeing people's incomes increase at anything like that level,\" she said.\nThe report said about 10 per cent of the regional population struggle with food insecurity, although Clarke said she thinks there may be more.\nThe report analyzed several household scenarios, comparing a family of four living on Ontario Works, minimum wage and on a median income.\nIt also looked at single men living on Ontario Works and ODSP, a single woman on old age security and a single woman with two kids on Ontario Works.\nThe single men on social assistance fared the worst. They would have to go into debt to afford healthy food along with the average monthly cost of rent.\n\"For single people it's absolutely impossible,\" said Clarke.\nOnly the family of four with a median income could comfortably afford food and rent, the report said. Everyone else was stuck paying more than 30 per cent of their income on rent, which puts them at a greater risk of food insecurity.\nFood insecurity is associated with poor mental and physical health, the report said. It also interferes with people's ability to perform at work and school, with research showing that kids from food-insecure households have poorer academic performance.\n\"[This] presents a major challenge in breaking the cycle of poverty since educational attainment is a critical factor in one's eventual income and economic status,\" the report said.\nFood baskets were calculated using a range of healthy food items, based on the 2007 version of Canada's Food Guide.\u00a0Only the barest necessities were included, Clarke said.\n\"There's no extras at all,\" she said, such as allowances for meals out or special foods for dietary restrictions.\nStaff also calculated the cost of different groceries based on the lowest price available at a range of stores, which is something most low-income people don't have the luxury to do, Clarke said.\n\"[People who are low income] have transportation problems as well, so usually they're not able to be as deliberate and as thorough as the public health people are when they come up with these numbers,\" she said.\nHousing costs were calculated using numbers from the Canada\u00a0Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nAlthough the region has some control in creating more affordable housing, Clarke said there isn't much it can do to keep down the cost of food. The region is also\u00a0home to a number of food hamper programs, but Clarke\u00a0said those are just \"bandage\" solutions.\n\"They don't solve what is really a fundamental problem of not enough income,\" she said.\nInstead, Clarke said it's time for the government to take a closer look at income-based solutions, such as the now-cancelled basic income pilot project.\nEven so, Clarke said solving food insecurity is a complex problem that calls for more than one solution.\n\"I think there are different roles that all the different levels of government need to play so that people can make ends meet.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Cambridge candidates on cost of living, environment and what you need to know about them", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/cambridge-candidates-federal-election-survey-1.5313623", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302818.1569860500!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cambridge-candidates.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-14T13:04:00.890Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Cambridge people will have a choice between seven candidates.\nThe candidates in Cambridge are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue Cambridge is facing right now is the housing crisis. There are not enough units available for the demand on the market, and not enough affordable housing units for those on wait lists in Waterloo region.\nAffordable housing is a solution to the issues that so many people face. It's a big part of the puzzle when it comes to helping people end drug abuse, to finding a job, for keeping a family together, and for reducing poverty overall. A re-elected Liberal government would continue to address the housing gap by building affordable housing and renovating existing stock.\nAlready in Cambridge, $6 million has been spent on new and renovated affordable housing, and under the $55 billion National Housing Strategy, that building of new units will continue.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nAs your Member of Parliament, I will continue to fight for investment in Cambridge, and keep a close eye on the policies that affect families here. Our government has been addressing affordability directly \u2014\u00a0every year, through our government's Canada Child Benefit, Cambridge parents receive over $80 million dollars. This supports more than 23,000 children in our community. We will continue to invest in the services and programs that families depend on.\nOur government has a plan to reduce cell phone bills, make housing more affordable for families, and support seniors who don't have the finances to retire securely. I will continue to fight for policies like this that put money directly into the pockets of middle-class families, and make life significantly more affordable for families.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur track record on the environment speaks for itself, and I want our government to keep making progress.\u00a0Our government put a price on pollution, polluting is no longer free in Canada. We will continue to take action on reducing emissions, supporting clean growth, and protecting and preserving our wildlife.\nOur government has been working to transition away from a carbon-based economy, and we must continue this progress, because the economy and the environment go hand-in-hand, and we cannot have one without the other. I will continue to fight for greater investment in renewable energy, programs to grow green solutions like our electric vehicle rebate, preservation of Canadian wildlife and our plan to plant two\u00a0billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI love Cambridge. I've lived here for two decades, and it's where I've chosen to raise my two children. Nothing is more important to me than helping families in this community succeed and access the help they need when they're facing challenges.\nEven before being your Member of Parliament, I spent my career serving our community in non-profit organizations like the YMCA,the Boys & Girls Club, and the University of Waterloo. I will always fight for our community, and the people that live here.\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've knocked on over 10,000 doors now, and what I hear most about is the opioid and addictions crisis. We've seen the harm caused by addiction, homelessness, and mental health issues in Cambridge. As your MP, my first task would be to declare a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, and commit to working with all levels of government, experts, and Canadians, to develop a national strategy on opioids.\nI would work to end the criminalization and stigma of addiction while getting tough on the real criminals - those who traffic in and profit from illegal drugs. I'll also work to pursue financial compensation from the drug companies responsible for this crisis. In parallel, I'll pursue an effective Affordable Housing strategy for\u00a0Cambridge, that will tackle homelessness, poverty, and housing shortages.\nThe opioid crisis stems from previous cuts to affordable housing, education, social services, and the unexpected impact of oxycontin and oxycodeiene being produced and pushed by pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s. To start fixing the crisis in Cambridge and beyond, we need to take these roots into consideration and deal with them today. There's no magic bullet, but we can heal our riding.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an\u00a0MP?\nFirst: Wages have stagnated while the cost of living, mortgages, tuition, etc., has skyrocketed. This means families are stuck paying for essentials like food, and services like childcare and medicine, on their credit cards. So, the first thing we can do is recoup the billions of dollars that are lost to corporate tax evaders, and implement a 1 per cent tax on those with more than $20 million in wealth. This will raise over $10 billion-plus per year, helping us pay for the services our families need, allowing us to pay off debts and make lives more affordable.\nSecond: The climate crisis demands immediate and rapid action. We must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quickly. The silver lining is that we are presented with an unprecedented economic opportunity, because the world is at the frontier of a green energy revolution. My vision is that, Cambridge, as an industrial town with our infrastructure and skilled workforce, is at the leading edge of this low-carbon energy transformation, building the electric cars and public-transit fleets and infrastructure of tomorrow. This will create hundreds of thousands of new, well-paying jobs. Either we build the future we want to see, or someone else will.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThis is an important question for me, since my PhD centered on Climate Politics.\nWe need less talk, and real action, immediately. We have less than 10 years to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by half to meet the IPCC's targets.\u00a0\nWe need a Green New Deal. This will require nothing less than a mass mobilization and transformation of the way our society understands and consumes energy. First and foremost, we cannot continue to increase emissions, which the TMX pipeline would do. So: no new pipelines; cut all fossil-fuel subsidies; and use the $3.3 billion previously given to the biggest polluters, to be directly invested into the low-carbon technologies of the future.\u00a0\nWe need this to science-based targets in line with keeping warming to 1.5 degrees.\nTo finance new projects, New Democrats will launch a Canada Climate Bank to make the big, meaningful investments in the innovative clean energy projects we need.\nRetrofitting homes to be energy efficient and electrifying public transit by 2030 will create over 300,000 good jobs all over Canada, rebuilding local economies while lowering emissions. This is crucial: fighting climate change in Cambridge BY building the low-carbon future we want to see.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI listen to everyone and I never cast judgment on anyone.\nI used to work as a landscaper, in minimum-wage retail, and then as a recruiter in human resources. I went back to school as a 'mature student' to study politics, because I was concerned about where the world was headed environmentally, economically, and politically. I studied hard, was accepted to do a Masters degree at Oxford University and a PhD in International Politics at the LSE (UK), and then I taught International and Environmental Security at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Balsillie School in Waterloo. I'm also on the Board of Directors of the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank.\nI decided to run for the NDP after the birth of my baby boy at Cambridge Memorial Hospital last year. I started thinking more about the future, and it scared me. So, I'm working now to make a better future for him, and for all of us. Cambridge is my home, it's where my wife and I want to raise our young family, and despite its issues, it's still an amazing place to live and it has much more potential.\nCambridge: Let's be good to one another.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is the climate crisis.\u00a0We have a small window to respond before damage becomes irreversible.\u00a0We are already seeing negative impacts\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe gap is getting larger between the rich and poor and many Canadians are getting lost in the system.\u00a0The Green Party advocates a universal living income and universal pharmacare.\u00a0\nAlso, we need to start focusing on health and well-being rather than always measuring how we are doing in terms of economic activity. I am already a supporter of the Well-Being Waterloo project and would like to see this focus on well-being scaled up\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Green Party has put forward a detailed action plan:\u00a0Mission Possible which\u00a0includes ending subsidies to fossil fuel immediately,\u00a0no new pipelines,\u00a0banning fracking\u00a0and scaling up the green economy.\u00a0\nWe need to make this transition for the planet and to participate in the global green economy and to do so in a way that supports workers and their families.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an entrepreneur, social innovator, community activist, artist and a grandmother.\u00a0In my business as a graphic recorder, I have worked with non-profits, municipal government and community leaders to facilitate creative solutions to some of the most wicked social problems facing\u00a0Cambridge,\u00a0Waterloo region and Brant County.\u00a0\nMy decision to run as Green Party candidate in Cambridge is motivated by my passion for a sustainable economy and a caring community.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nWhen I'm talking with Cambridge residents, I most often hear two concerns,\u00a0one with a very local focus and the other with a national focus.\nRelated to the former, residents are concerned about drug use, especially opioids, in the downtown core. For the PPC, addressing the drug issue will involve putting the safety and well-being of law-abiding citizens first. Research proves that safe injection sites encourage riskier drug use leading to more deaths but do almost nothing to get people clean. So I don't support a SIS (supervised injection site). A compassionate approach will focus on getting addicts off drugs and that's what the PPC is for.\nThe other concern that is mentioned is the issue the corruption of national government leaders. [Liberal Leader Justin] Trudeau's broken promises and [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer's willingness to pander to get votes \u2014 whether it's caving in to the dairy cartel or giving Quebec, but no other province, the ability to set immigration rates \u2014 people are frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does one address this problem of corruption? One needs to vote in politicians who tell the truth and refuse to pander even if it means it will cost them votes. Only Maxime Bernier and the People's Party is willing to follow that path.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nA People's Party government will let citizens keep more of the money from their pay cheques through lower income taxes. If you make less than $15,000 per year, you will pay no tax. If you make between $15,000 and $100,000 your income tax rate is just 15 per cent.\u00a0 And that will give middle-class Canadians thousands more every year. Those making over $100,000 pay 25 per cent.\nThe PPC is also the only party to end supply management \u2014 or producer price fixing \u2014 on milk, eggs and poultry. Ending supply management will lower the price on these food staples and lower people's grocery bill by about $600 a year.\nThe PPC is going to open up cellphones, internet and cable industries to full competition. With more businesses competing for your business, prices will go down. We'll also open airlines and other near-monopolies to competition to increase competition and get prices lower.\nFinally, we'll also lower immigration and that will lead to increased wages for lower skill and entry level position (see work of Harvard economist, George Borjas); it will also lead to lower housing prices (see work of Dr. Daniel Hiebert, UBC).\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe PPC is skeptical of the alarmist claims being made because they just don't stand up to the science. We agree that the temperature is getting gradually warmer \u2014 now up 1 degree Celsius since 1800. Science also shows that CO2 in the atmosphere can increase warming.\nHowever, the science is also very clear that levels of C02 in the atmosphere didn't reach concentrations great enough to effect warming until the 1960s. The warming we see now started in the 1800s. For something to be a cause, it cannot come after the effect.\nBased on the evidence, the People's Party is going to focus on the most pressing environmental needs for Canadians. Health Canada's says that currently over 14,000 people in North America die annually from air pollution from human sources. Pollution in our lakes, rivers and oceans causes hundreds of cases of illness every year.\nMany indigenous communities have no clean water to drink.\nWe're making safe drinking water for remote indigenous communities our first priority and it's part of a larger, firm commitment to combat air and water pollution.\nThis video is my response to climate alarmism.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nMy family \u2014 my wife Maggie and our five children \u2014 and I have made their home in Cambridge for almost 20 years. Our ties to the community have been made strong though volunteer involvement like running summer camps for kids.\nI'm a tenured professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and I've been a leading proponent for freedom of conscience and expression on academic campuses and in Canadian society more generally. My decision to enter politics is rooted in my concern that:\nThe people of Cambridge need to know that I will tell the truth even if the truth is uncomfortable to hear. I will not pander for votes. I think that every human being must be treated with respect but every idea must be open to debate.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing the riding and how would you address it?\nThe most pressing issue facing the people of Cambridge and all of Canada is the need for political renewal.\nWe need to change the political and electoral process so people can participate in making the decisions that affect their lives and the society.\nIn the present situation the major parties act as a cartel to keep their monopoly on power and control of the political process and the peoples' participation is merely to vote every four years. The interests served by this cartel of parties are not those of the working people, they are the interests of the monopolies and the oligopolies which they serve. The most people can hope for\u00a0is to \"influence an MP.\"\nWe can reject this system where the political parties come to power. By speaking in our own name about our concerns, about what should be the priorities in the economy, health care, education and other matters of national interest, working people can embark on a new path to serve their own interests. We can exercise direct control over the decisions we ourselves take and speak in our own name. Importantly, this includes what to do in the 2019 election itself.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP.\nWe need a new direction for the economy. Workers are the producers. We and our families are those most affected by upheavals in the economy, as the basis of our livelihoods is destroyed and public services and social programs come under attack. The austerity agenda which has been unleashed is playing havoc with our lives.\nWorkers are the producers of all the social wealth necessary for the economy and the society to function. It is our rights that must be at the centre of setting a new direction for the economy, one that recognizes the rights of all people. In the current situation, it is monopoly right that is held sacred. Multinationals move in or out of the area, according to their own private interests. Governments at all levels entice them to move in with various pay-the-rich schemes, and then protect them when they move out.\nSpeaking with our peers in own voice about the problems that face us, presenting our own experience with the ruling class and its pay-the-rich schemes, working out our own proposals to humanize the natural and social environment and taking our own decisions are important in breaking with the status quo.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address these concerns.\nA very significant step the government should take, is to withdraw from NATO, NORAD, and the U.S. war machine, which is the world's biggest\u00a0polluter, and the major source of war and aggression internationally.\nThe problems in the environment are crying out for the working people to empower themselves to set a direction for the economy that serves to humanize the social and the natural environment\nA government whose aim is to address the concerns of the people and to build a bright future for the people and the coming generations will restrict the monopolies and oligopolies from their destructive activities.\nAround the world, it is the people speaking out in their own name on these issues that is depriving the monopolies and oligopolies, and governments in their service, of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\nThe government should stop blaming individual behaviour for destroying the environment. Here and internationally, governments must take measures to end\u00a0 destructive practices of the monopolies and oligopolies, such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water and fraudulent environmental assessments.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm running because it is the right of working people, as the producers of all of the social wealth, to have a say in how the society is organized. It is our right to participate in making those decisions which affect our lives.\nThe cartel parties deprive us of this right with their monopoly on power and cordon sanitaire around all areas of decision-making. The interests they serve are those of the monopolies and oligopolies. They decide all matters pertaining to the election \u2014 including who the candidates will be and what the \"issues\" are.\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada is calling on people to discuss with their peers how make their vote count.\nA vote for the candidates of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada and its program for democratic renewal is an affirmation of working peoples' right to have a say in how society and the economy is organized \u2014 that it's not the exclusive preserve of the cartel parties.\nIn ridings where MLPC candidates are not running, this statement can be made by voting for other small party candidates or independents.\nParty website\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/666331715520", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/651118147931", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685892912", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569483843976", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1569488963560", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Ania Bessonov", "title": "Little Jamaica businesses suffer amid yet another delay in Eglinton LRT construction", "description": "Construction began in 2011, now the LRT's opening has been delayed until 2022", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/little-jamaica-lrt-construction-1.5484610", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5484646.1583281222!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/eglinton-west.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 04, 2020 5:00 AM ET", "2020-03-04T10:00:00.032Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Small business owners in Little Jamaica are struggling to make ends meet, and now that there's yet another delay in the projected opening of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, the situation looks even more bleak.\nThe neighbourhood, which stretches along Eglinton from Allen Road all the way west to Keele Street, has been overwhelmed by the light-rail construction\u00a0project since 2011, leaving many sidewalks closed and foot traffic profoundly reduced.

Now, with the construction and parking commotion, coming to the barbershop is difficult.\n\"This is where everyone comes to sit down and get their groom done right, and it's truly inconvenient,\" said Thomas.\u00a0\nThe 19-km light rail line was initially supposed to be finished in 2021, but last week, Metrolinx announced the completion date has since been pushed back to sometime in 2022.\u00a0\nCity councillors for the area, Josh Matlow and Michael Colle, held a news\u00a0conference Tuesday at Jerusalem Restaurant, acknowledging the impact and encouraging people to shop at the stores on Eglinton.\u00a0\n\"Many of [the businesses] are going to be shutting their doors because they won't be able to survive unless we go and be customers there and support them,\" said Matlow.\nApproximately\u00a0140 of those doors have already closed and the councillors are asking the province to help compensate the businesses that are still open.\u00a0\n\"If the Ford government says it's for the people, then the question is, which people? Here's a bunch of people who are struggling to make ends meet,\" said Matlow.\u00a0\nAn invitation to join the new\u00a0conference was extended to the Ontario Transportation\u00a0Minister Caroline Mulroney. She did not attend.\u00a0\nThe Ministry of Transportation also forwarded questions from CBC News\u00a0to Metrolinx. The regional transit authority said\u00a0it will continue to support the businesses, but said they can't financial compensation.\u00a0\nA couple of not-for-profits are working on addressing the impact the construction is having on the community.\u00a0\nRomain Baker co-founded one of the organizations, named Black UrbanismTO.\u00a0He lives in the neighbourhood and\u00a0started noticing businesses were closing down in the last few years.\u00a0\n\"I saw there was a huge gap in knowledge,\" said Baker, referring to the lack of information the owners were receiving on how the construction would affect\u00a0them.\n\"I saw that as a barrier for business owners to be able to prepare themselves for additional burdens.\"\nBaker looked to bridge that gap. He and two others from the community founded their organization in 2018 with a focus on encouraging the community to \"play an active role in how the neighbourhood develops.\n\"Unless the city is intentional in reaching certain demographics, that level of engagement doesn't happen,\" he said.\u00a0\nSo far, they have held consultation sessions with the local business owners to brainstorm ways to support each other as the construction continues.\nThe LRT project is also expected to raise prices in the neighbourhood once it's finished. But McDonald is worried he may not stay open to see it.\u00a0\n\"We don't know if we're going to be here \u2026 The way they've gentrified the area, they're really forcing us out.\"\nBlack Futures on Eglinton, another not-for-profit organization responding to the impact of the construction, is focusing on making affordable housing a priority for the neighbourhood.\u00a0\nThey have been holding cultural events in the community, including a reggae night.\n\"There was a big message from the community,\" said Cheryll Case, founder of Black Futures on Eglinton.\n\"Availability of affordable housing and keeping businesses open is key to preserving the culture.\"\u00a0\nBoth organizations have been in talks with the city and hope to see more support to the community.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1568874563631", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1568826947826", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Trevor Pritchard", "title": "Highway 17 widening ignites hope in Renfrew", "description": "Work to make highway 4 lanes from Arnprior to Renfrew could start in next 2 to 3 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/province-widens-highway-17-arnprior-renfrew-1.5208401", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3795553.1475856932!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/highway-17-fatal-6-vehicle-crash-opp-thick-fog-oct-7-2016.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 11, 2019 2:35 PM ET", "2019-07-12T10:24:33.409Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The province has announced plans to convert the remaining two-lane\u00a0stretch\u00a0of Highway 17 between Renfrew, Ont., and Arnprior, Ont., to four lanes.\nThe 22.5-kilometre stretch to be widened\u00a0runs from Scheel Drive in\u00a0the Township of McNab/Braeside to three kilometres west of Bruce Street in Renfrew, according to a news release from Renfrew\u2013Nipissing\u2013Pembroke MPP John Yakabuski\u00a0on Thursday.\nThe project will also include the construction of four new interchanges.\u00a0\n\"The economic opportunities, the development, the growth, and the tremendous enhancement to highway safety is something that we consider a top priority,\" said Yakabuski in a video posted to Twitter on Thursday.\nWidening Highway 17 in eastern Ontario was a promise that Premier Doug Ford made in the run-up to the 2018 provincial election.\nOnce completed, the entire highway between Arnprior and Renfrew would be four lanes.

Or ask my high-school girlfriend \u2014\u00a0during a dinner in the late 1980s, her mom could not quite grasp the subtleties of me dancing around the fact that our house had been repossessed by the bank after a downturn. Or ask the hundreds of oil and gas workers who have participated in research I've undertaken.\nGrowing up an oilpatch brat, working in the industry, conducting long-term social science research on its impacts \u2014 I am confident saying the energy sector is not all it's cracked up to be.\nImportantly, this is not commentary on the workers, families and communities that support the industry. To them, I tip my hard hat.\nBut after\u00a0a convoy of oilpatch workers recently headed to Edmonton to counter the public environmentalism of Greta Thunberg, I felt compelled to remind people what they were defending.\nWhen my father, who worked in oil and gas most of his life, was in his forties, I could imagine him firing up his Chevy half-ton and driving to Edmonton from southern Alberta to protest some teenage foreigner trying to derail the primacy of oil and gas in the province.\nBut in the latter years of his life, I doubt he'd have been up for it. He'd come to know the oil and gas industry much like I came to understand it.\nIn short, it's pretty brutal, pretty unforgiving. Chews you up, spits you out.\nAnd I'm talking about people who have devoted their entire lives to it.\nIt's not a surprise. The power at the top is global, immense and hell-bent on squeezing every penny out of the labour that goes into producing oil and gas. The industry has long been one based on inequality, bootstrap individualism and high-octane opportunism.\nI was born into oil and gas. It put our family through the wringer more than once, but especially during the '80s when the bottom fell out, and my dad lost everything but his shirt to plummeting oil prices.\nLater, during one of the rather short-lived booms, I worked as a roughneck on both service rigs and drilling rigs. But I never planned to make it my career, in no small part because the experience gave me a first-hand look at what I would later learn through long-term anthropological research about the harsh impacts of oil and gas on individuals, families and communities.\nImportantly, the industry does have its benefits, including relatively good wages. But it's only a good living if you're foresighted and fortunate enough to prepare for the bust, which always comes.\nAnd even during the booms, workers and their families face challenges. Drilling for oil is often done in remote locations, and energy companies want rigs running 24 hours a day.\nJobs in this sector include shift work in places far from home, which means workers spend weeks if not months away from loved ones. Interview after interview (and personal experience) revealed families struggling with these arrangements. Shift work is hard on the body, and the long-term separation comes with all kinds of problems for families.\nOilpatch communities are always trying to keep up, and it seems like they never really can. Boom and bust cycles are unpredictable; community leaders are often just wrapping their minds around how to handle the impacts of a boom when the bust hits. Major labour and housing shortages can turn, basically overnight, into high unemployment and housing market crashes.\nNot all booms and busts look the same, so even knowing this history does not always prepare communities.\nAnd let's not forget just how opportunistic and contradictory\u00a0the powerful people in the industry are. When times are good, they argue that government needs to get out of the way, that progress should not be impeded by labour or environmental regulations.\nConsider, however, the fact that oil and gas are extracted on land secured from Indigenous people with the help of the government.\nAnd what about the government subsidies from which the industry benefits?\u00a0When the boom ends, industry enthusiasts are quick to fault the government for not prioritizing the sector's recovery.\nThere are a lot of good reasons to transition away from this industry.\nIt will be critical to consider the workers and families in the industry as we do so. The next economic arrangement should put workers, families and the environment first \u2014 and investors and corporate bigwigs last.\nIn short, we'd be better off without oil and gas, and I'd bet there are plenty of workers and families who'd love an economy based on more stable, just and environmentally friendly industries.\n"}, {"author": "Kate Porter", "title": "City urged to show 'spine' on climate change", "description": "Environment committee approves strategy to reduce GHG emissions", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/climate-change-master-plan-committee-delegations-1.5399099", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5109417.1556132778!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/climate-change-rally-april-24.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Dec 17, 2019 3:10 PM ET", "2019-12-17T20:10:19.284Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Environmental advocates\u00a0are urging city councillors to show some \"spine\" as they usher Ottawa toward a cleaner, greener future.\nAt its meeting Tuesday, the city's committee on environmental protection, water and waste management endorsed tough new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a new climate change master plan.\n\"The work laid out in this plan is enormous, but is in keeping with the enormous scale of work to be done,\" Sharon Coward, executive director\u00a0of EnviroCentre, told councillors.\nThe staff report sets out a climate road map to 2050.

It's easy enough for politicians to talk up a roaring economy. In its own way, it's easy to say what you'd do when\u00a0the economy is in the tank. But a patchwork of mostly good and some bad is a harder pitch.\nAnd right now, Canada's economy is doing OK. Maybe not great, but certainly not bad. That's not exactly the kind of quote that's\u00a0put on posters.\n\"The economy was fairly weak over the latter half of 2018,\" said\u00a0Pedro Antunes, chief economist with the Conference Board of Canada. But, he noted, \"We've seen a modest pick up in the first quarter.\"\nOn a longer scale,\u00a0the last three or four years,\u00a0Antunes said\u00a0the Canadian economy has \"done quite well.\" And while it may sometimes be hard for Canadians to see that bigger picture, economists say the country's economic\u00a0indicators are relatively strong.\n\"The aggregate economic data in Canada is looking quite strong,\" said\u00a0Frances Donald, chief economist and head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife.\u00a0\"We have plenty of jobs, wages are rising, GDP numbers are fairly solid.\"\nThat's all the more remarkable\u00a0given that much of the world is doing a lot worse.\nAnd yet\u00a0a new poll commissioned for CBC News\u00a0highlights Canadians' economic anxiety, with 32 per cent of respondents saying that\u00a0the cost of living is\u00a0the thing they are most worried about.\nWatch why some Canadians say they're worried about the cost of living:\nIn a lot of ways, that makes sense, according to Donald.\u00a0\nThe broader economy\u00a0is\u00a0performing well,\u00a0but many Canadians still struggle:\u00a0Housing affordability is still at crisis levels in Toronto and Vancouver,\u00a0energy prices remain stubbornly low,\u00a0and child-care costs weigh heavily on families.\n\"So while the data,\u00a0as a whole, still looks fairly solid,\" said\u00a0Donald,\u00a0\"it's completely understandable,\u00a0even from someone who spends all day looking at numbers,\u00a0... why consumers and households might be feeling a little bit nervous.\"\nWhat's more, concern about the cost of living ranked as the top worry for every segment of Canadians polled:\u00a0Indigenous Canadians, new Canadians, first-time voters and visible minorities.\nWhile just one in 10 Canadians say they're not getting by financially, another 68 per cent say they \"have to think about how they spend money.\" And concern over jobs ranks seventh\u00a0in terms of what worries Canadians the most.\u00a0\nIt's easy to understand where those concerns come from. Debt\u00a0levels remain high. Wages are finally beginning to rise, but growth has been stubbornly low for decades.\nStill, an honest accounting of the data shows that that negative perception doesn't quite match the economic reality.\nWhen asked to rank their top three most important election issues, a full 35 per cent\u00a0of Canadians polled listed\u00a0\"jobs/the economy.\" But Canada has been posting record job creation. The Canadian economy added 27,000 jobs in May, and\u00a0in April, a stunning 106,500 jobs were added.\u00a0In all, nearly half a million jobs were added over the past 12 months.\nWage\u00a0growth is also coming in above inflation, meaning Canadians are seeing their wages rise faster than the cost of the things we buy, from food to gasoline.\nWhat's more, many of the jobs being added are high-paying tech and financial services jobs.\n\"If you look at the period over the last decade or so, where\u00a0we've seen this kind of restructuring away from high-paid manufacturing jobs, we've seen almost as many jobs created in this [other] segment of the economy, this professional services segment,\" said Antunes.\nThe CBC poll also found that 54 per cent\u00a0of respondents worry\u00a0that accepting too many immigrants would change Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but economists say that change is much needed,\u00a0specifically on the jobs front.\n\"Let's just take a look at where labour markets are today,\" said\u00a0Antunes. \"We\u00a0have an unemployment rate that's at 5.4 per cent. According to some estimates, that's as low as it can get.\"\nCanada, he said,\u00a0is essentially at \"rock bottom on the employment rate.\"\nThe Conference Board of Canada recently released a report highlighting the need for more immigration.\n\"There's no doubt about it that immigration will contribute to the\u00a0labour force,\" said Antunes.\u00a0\"When you talk to employers in many parts of this country, [they're] desperate to find skilled and less skilled workers, and immigration is going to be a big part of solving that gap.\"\nThat kind of disconnect appears throughout perceptions around\u00a0the economy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0whether it's jobs,\u00a0trade wars,\u00a0exports or oil prices. Exacerbating that is the fact that Canada isn't just one singular economy, said Donald.\u00a0Rather, it's a sort of a patchwork of regional and sector-based economies.\n\"The economy is\u00a0\u2014 and feels \u2014 different depending on which province you're in,\" she said.\u00a0\"We have the energy patch, we have urban areas that are being driven predominantly by housing activity,\u00a0and then we have other key cities and rural areas that are swayed by neither of those two factors.\"\nEconomic anxiety also becomes amplified by global oil prices and international trade tensions. Canada alone doesn't have much influence in changing those.\u00a0But both feed into the notion that the economy is struggling, no matter what the data says.\nBut if you can look past the\u00a0anecdotal evidence\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a hard feat for everyone, no doubt\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you'll find an economy performing pretty well. And in a world full of turmoil and trouble, pretty well is pretty good.\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "N.W.T. finances leave minister with little wiggle room ahead of her first budget address", "description": "Caroline Wawzonek has promised to be creative as numbers paint a grim picture", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-2020-budget-caroline-wawzonek-1.5464713", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5348979.1572988652!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/portfolios-announcement.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 6:00 AM CT", "2020-02-25T12:00:00.732Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek has a challenge ahead of her as she prepares to deliver her first budget for the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\nThere's a laundry list of issues \u2014 housing, infrastructure, education and justice reform \u2014\u00a0a new crop of MLAs working to have their priorities addressed, and limited money to spend to get it done.\nIn Tuesday's budget address, Wawzonek will lay out the government's spending on its day-to-day operations and reveal the government's overall fiscal strategy for the next four years.\u00a0\nIt's the latest chance for a new government looking to differentiate itself from its predecessor to put its own stamp on things.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSince last fall's election, it's sketched out a broad vision with its priorities and mandate. Tuesday's budget and subsequent spending bills will show how it will spend the money to make that vision a reality.\u00a0\nBut Wawzonek and the government don't\u00a0have much room to manoeuvre and public accounts from 2019 explain why.\u00a0\nIf the budget lays out what a government plans to do, the public accounts spell out what's actually happened. It's year-end analysis uses three measures to determine how healthy the government's finances are: sustainability, flexibility and vulnerability.\u00a0\nIn all three measures the government is failing.\u00a0\nThe government is running out of room to take on debt and doesn't have many options to bring in new sources of money, according to the accounts.\u00a0\nNearly 75 per cent of the government's money comes from the federal government. Taxes, which make up the rest, aren't reliable since the biggest corporate taxpayers are the territory's diamond mines.\u00a0\nTheir taxes fluctuate every year based on production and global prices and demand. Last year corporate tax from non-renewable resources dropped by $42.8 million compared to what was brought in during 2018.\u00a0\nContrast that with government expenses, which came in just over $2 billion last year, mostly split between the operations and management budget and compensation and benefits for employees.\u00a0\nRead more about the territorial debt cap and how it affects spending decisions\u00a0\n\"The economic math is the same from the kitchen table right to the cabinet table,\" explained Michael Miltenberger,\u00a0former territorial finance minister from 2007-2015.\u00a0\n\"You have that discussion about what we can afford? How much debt can we take on? Can we manage our credit card debt?\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Governments do that too, it's just a bigger order of magnitude.\"\u00a0\nThese questions are often the hardest right after an election, when newly-elected MLAs all vie to deliver on their election promises but find there isn't any more money to do that, Miltenberger said.\u00a0\nAs government borrowing creeps closer to the territory's $1.3 billion debt cap, it's becoming increasingly difficult to spend without cutting.\n\"They have the imperatives that they got elected on, that they want to move on,\" Miltenberger said. \"If you want to add, you have to cut and control your costs, control the size of your bureaucracy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIn December, Finance Minister Wawzonek tamped down expectations of bold changes early on, describing the territory's economy as \"stabilized but\u00a0stagnant.\"\u00a0\nShe noted revenues dropped $80 million in the past year and that the government has\u00a0taken on more short-term debt\u00a0with its banks to make up the shortfall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRead more about how the 19th Assembly is building its first budget\u00a0\nAs to her upcoming budget, she's promised to be \"creative\" and collaborate with regular MLAs, though she's yet to elaborate on what it will look like.\u00a0\nIn a briefing earlier this month, Wawzonek repeated that promise but remained cagey and declined to give out details ahead of the budget speech.\n\"It's an ongoing process to be creative, we have discussions going on,\" she said, noting much of the work on this budget happened as she was settling into the role after last fall's\u00a0election.\u00a0\n\"There's an opportunity to do more in the spring, after the budget address,\" she said.\u00a0\nThe debt limit does hem in her ability to be creative though, with about $300 million left before the government reaches its debt limit. It usually uses debt to pay for infrastructure projects that can't be paid through the government's surplus at the end of the year.\u00a0\n$300 million is about enough to pay for another highway, a new hospital, or run a government department for a year.\u00a0\n\"You could spend that in a heartbeat,\" Miltenberger said. \"We have infrastructure deficits in the billions of dollars, housing [deficits] in the billions of dollars \u2026 $300 million is chump change.\"\nThis all adds up to a difficult task for any finance minister, especially one who's brand new to the role. With Tuesday's budget address, Wawzonek will show how her government plans to take that challenge on.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Warm weather creating 'crisis' for First Nations that rely on ice roads", "description": "Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug is flying in fuel and pondering how to ship materials for a new school", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/northwestern-ontario-winter-roads-1.5450315", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5123904.1557087784!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/melting-ice-road.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 04, 2020 6:00 AM ET", "2020-02-04T11:00:00.853Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Warm weather is playing havoc with the winter road network that connects remote First Nations in northwestern\u00a0Ontario to the provincial highway system, according to the Nishnawbe Aski Nation.\nOnly one\u00a0community's winter road was fully operational as of Jan. 31, according to NAN's\u00a0winter road report.\u00a0 Fifteen communities have roads that are open to light traffic and three to partial traffic.

Those at the forefront of the fight have mostly moved on, some even commending the job that was done.\nBut the finished product has opened the door for a host of new challenges, like increased traffic \u2014 and swelling costs of living in communities along the highway.\n\"It made communities like Squamish near to Vancouver,\" said former B.C. Liberal cabinet minister Kevin Falcon.\u00a0\"A lot of people are now living and commuting back and forth along the corridor. That was not a realistic option under the old highway.\"\nPrior to its expansion, the Sea-to-Sky Highway was known for its hazards. The bulk of it was two lanes, undivided and without any\u00a0outside barrier.\n\"That was the most dangerous sections of highway in British Columbia, where terrible tragedies, injuries, deaths occurred,\" said Falcon.\nIn the mid-2000s, Falcon was B.C.'s transportation minister tasked with overseeing upgrades to the highway as part of its 2010 Olympic Bid.\n\"We had a major rock slide just a few years prior to the Olympics that got international attention,\" he said. \"It was unsafe, it was a very narrow road .... the Olympics just gave us a reason to accelerate what needed to be done.\"\nThe project ended up costing upwards of $600 million, but a major point of contention was the Eagleridge Bluffs area of the corridor,\u00a0now the site of the Nelson Creek Bridge.\nResidents rallied against construction plans, which they said would destroy sensitive habitat to native species including the red-tailed frog. Former West Vancouver mayor Pamela Goldsmith-Jones\u00a0was among those calling for the province to build a tunnel rather than cutting through the wetland.\nProtests blockaded construction, but a court eventually ruled against them and ordered them to leave. Indigenous rights activist Harriet Nahanee, and environmentalist\u00a0Betty Krawczyk were arrested for violating the\u00a0court injunction.\u00a0Krawczyk was subsequently sentenced to ten months in prison.\nWatch: the highway is safer, but that's brought new challenges to Squamish\nShortly after the upgrades were complete, the highway enjoyed a significant drop in crashes.\u00a0Between 1998 and 2007, 63 people died on the Sea-to-Sky Highway.\u00a0\u00a0There were upwards of 200 crashes per year. But by\u00a02010, after the upgrades were complete, the number of crashes dropped by\u00a066 per cent.\nCommunities along the corridor have grown significantly in the years since \u2014 Squamish and Whistler are among the fastest growing cities in B.C. According to the Ministry of Transportation, more than 19,000 commuters drive the Sea to Sky highway\u00a0each day \u2014 up 24 per cent over a decade.\nAccording to Squamish's\u00a0recently passed Official Community Plan, the district could double in the next 20 years.\nMayor\u00a0Karen Elliott says the renewed highway has\u00a0made her community a far more attractive living option for people who work in Metro Vancouver.\n\"It's brought some big city problems that with grappling with for our community,\" she said. \"The cost of housing, it went up very quickly. Our vacancy rate has been near zero since 2015.\"\nThe streets of Squamish are lined with new developments, with many more in the pipeline. The municipality is currently working toward an affordable housing plan to in part address the issue. The benchmark price for a single-family home in the community has risen to about $1 million.\nElliott says traffic has also become a big issue.\n\"Probably about 25 per cent of our population is going north or south on the highway right now,\" added \"Now we see that highway with the tourism traffic and commuters, on busy weekends \u2014 it starts to fail.\"\nShe's hoping to see improved regional transit to help address some of the congestion.\n\"We're working with the mayors in the corridor and the Squamish-Lillooet\u00a0Regional District, and we're working with the province on a funding model that will work for regional transit,\" said Elliot.\nFor those looking back, they admit there were some positive changes. Pamela Goldsmith-Jones says\u00a0West Vancouver adopted a more eco-friendly approach when it comes to approving new developments following the Sea-to-Sky Highway upgrades.\n\"Now, through processes that we put in place, the streams come first, the trees come first, and development will try to put on as small of a footprint as possible,\" she said.\nMeanwhile protesters like\u00a0McArthur\u00a0say have no regrets over their demonstrations and court challenges. After raising concerns to the province, he says contractors were able to preserve a swath of wetland near White Lake.\nCrews even installed passageways onto the road for frogs to cross through.\n\"I'm pretty convinced because we did make a stance that we got a better job than we would have if we just were quiet,\" he said. \"It appears that they were more sensitive to the environment because we spoke out.\"\n\"[But] it still bothers me to look at all the concrete and asphalt,\" he added.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "U.S. reports on GDP, consumer spending remain positive", "description": "Improvement in economic data seemingly reduces the risks of a recession in the near term", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-economy-reports-1.5375050", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5375062.1574868732!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/economy-gdp.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 27, 2019 10:49 AM ET", "2019-11-27T15:49:58.494Z"], "source": null, "content": "U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, rather than slowing as initially reported, and there are signs the downturn in business investment could be drawing to a close.\nThe economy's prospects were further brightened by other data on Wednesday showing the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after being stuck at a five-month high for two straight weeks, and that consumer spending rose steadily in October.\nThe reports were released in the wake of data showing an acceleration in housing market activity early in the fourth quarter and a sharp decline in the goods trade deficit, as well as a solid pace of inventory accumulation by retailers.\nThe improvement in the economic data further diminished the risks of recession in the near term. The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.\nSecond-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion.\nAfter-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6 per cent, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3 per cent rate in the second quarter.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3 per cent rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures briefly extended gains and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose after the release of the data. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.9 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Warm weather creating 'crisis' for First Nations that rely on ice roads", "description": "Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug is flying in fuel and pondering how to ship materials for a new school", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/northwestern-ontario-winter-roads-1.5450315", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5123904.1557087784!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/melting-ice-road.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 04, 2020 6:00 AM ET", "2020-02-04T11:00:00.853Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Warm weather is playing havoc with the winter road network that connects remote First Nations in northwestern\u00a0Ontario to the provincial highway system, according to the Nishnawbe Aski Nation.\nOnly one\u00a0community's winter road was fully operational as of Jan. 31, according to NAN's\u00a0winter road report.\u00a0 Fifteen communities have roads that are open to light traffic and three to partial traffic.

CBC was given an early look at the platform.\nThe party promises to reform Canada's health-care system to fund a whole new suite of services, just as the Liberals are looking at creating a national drug plan. On Wednesday, a Liberal government-appointed advisory council called for a $15-billion single-payer pharmacare plan and the federal health minister says Ottawa is considering next steps.\nThe NDP plan, titled \"A New Deal for People,\" will be launched at a campaign-style rally Sunday at the Hamilton Convention Centre during the Ontario NDP's weekend-long convention.\nIt will be a homecoming for Singh, who left the provincial party and was elected federal party leader less than two years ago. The party's hope is that the platform launch will provide a much-needed boost for Singh and other candidates who will soon head back to their ridings for a summer of campaigning. Lately, national polls have been showing the centre-left party losing ground to the Green Party.\nOne question Singh undoubtedly will face is the obvious one: How do you pay for\u00a0biggest new federal health care investment\u00a0in generations?\nThe NDP platform says it would phase in the expansion of health coverage, starting with\u00a0universal pharmacare in 2020. The platform doesn't offer a complete timeline, nor does it outline the full cost of the program, saying the party would need to study the issue and work with provinces to implement it.\u00a0\nThe party outlines measures to boost government revenues to help pay for the multi-billion dollar reform. The party would raise taxes on the wealthiest Canadians \u2014 those with wealth over $20 million annually. It also would raise corporate taxes, end fossil fuel subsidies, close tax loopholes and levy a foreign home buyers tax.\nThe party says it expects that some of these fiscal measures won't just boost government revenues, but also fight money laundering and cool down overheated housing markets in Vancouver and Ontario.\nThe Parliamentary Budget Officer, an independent officer of parliament, will review the plan, the\u00a0NDP\u00a0says. This election is the first time the PBO, which typically reviews government spending and policy initiatives,\u00a0will make itself available to assess the fiscal soundness of party platforms.\nThe CBC's David Thurton can be reached on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0at\u00a0david.thurton@cbc.ca.\nGet analysis from our Parliamentary bureau as we count down to the federal election.

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of state-allied militias \u2014 many backed by Iran \u2014 called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying \"your message has been received.\"\nBy late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.\n\"After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,\" said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. \"We rubbed America's nose in the dirt.\"\nKataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the\u00a0airstrikes, initially refused to leave, but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.\n\"We don't care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring marines,\" said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesperson\u00a0for Kataib Hezbollah.\n\"On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,\" he said, before withdrawing from the area.\nThe violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran's economy.\nIraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran's heavy influence over the country's affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.\nU.S. President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.\nIran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying \"if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.\"\nIran later summoned the Swiss charge d'affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.\nTensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.\nU.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.\nThe U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.\nThe U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq's Shia\u00a0majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.\nIran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shia militia\u00a0to battle ISIS when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.\nThe political influence of the PMF has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.\nThey have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.\nThe militia\u00a0and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.\nIraq's government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.\n\"Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,\" the Crisis Group, an international think-tank, said in a briefing on the crisis. \"The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.\"\n"}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "N.W.T. finances leave minister with little wiggle room ahead of her first budget address", "description": "Caroline Wawzonek has promised to be creative as numbers paint a grim picture", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-2020-budget-caroline-wawzonek-1.5464713", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5348979.1572988652!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/portfolios-announcement.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 6:00 AM CT", "2020-02-25T12:00:00.732Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Finance Minister Caroline Wawzonek has a challenge ahead of her as she prepares to deliver her first budget for the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\nThere's a laundry list of issues \u2014 housing, infrastructure, education and justice reform \u2014\u00a0a new crop of MLAs working to have their priorities addressed, and limited money to spend to get it done.\nIn Tuesday's budget address, Wawzonek will lay out the government's spending on its day-to-day operations and reveal the government's overall fiscal strategy for the next four years.\u00a0\nIt's the latest chance for a new government looking to differentiate itself from its predecessor to put its own stamp on things.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSince last fall's election, it's sketched out a broad vision with its priorities and mandate. Tuesday's budget and subsequent spending bills will show how it will spend the money to make that vision a reality.\u00a0\nBut Wawzonek and the government don't\u00a0have much room to manoeuvre and public accounts from 2019 explain why.\u00a0\nIf the budget lays out what a government plans to do, the public accounts spell out what's actually happened. It's year-end analysis uses three measures to determine how healthy the government's finances are: sustainability, flexibility and vulnerability.\u00a0\nIn all three measures the government is failing.\u00a0\nThe government is running out of room to take on debt and doesn't have many options to bring in new sources of money, according to the accounts.\u00a0\nNearly 75 per cent of the government's money comes from the federal government. Taxes, which make up the rest, aren't reliable since the biggest corporate taxpayers are the territory's diamond mines.\u00a0\nTheir taxes fluctuate every year based on production and global prices and demand. Last year corporate tax from non-renewable resources dropped by $42.8 million compared to what was brought in during 2018.\u00a0\nContrast that with government expenses, which came in just over $2 billion last year, mostly split between the operations and management budget and compensation and benefits for employees.\u00a0\nRead more about the territorial debt cap and how it affects spending decisions\u00a0\n\"The economic math is the same from the kitchen table right to the cabinet table,\" explained Michael Miltenberger,\u00a0former territorial finance minister from 2007-2015.\u00a0\n\"You have that discussion about what we can afford? How much debt can we take on? Can we manage our credit card debt?\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Governments do that too, it's just a bigger order of magnitude.\"\u00a0\nThese questions are often the hardest right after an election, when newly-elected MLAs all vie to deliver on their election promises but find there isn't any more money to do that, Miltenberger said.\u00a0\nAs government borrowing creeps closer to the territory's $1.3 billion debt cap, it's becoming increasingly difficult to spend without cutting.\n\"They have the imperatives that they got elected on, that they want to move on,\" Miltenberger said. \"If you want to add, you have to cut and control your costs, control the size of your bureaucracy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nIn December, Finance Minister Wawzonek tamped down expectations of bold changes early on, describing the territory's economy as \"stabilized but\u00a0stagnant.\"\u00a0\nShe noted revenues dropped $80 million in the past year and that the government has\u00a0taken on more short-term debt\u00a0with its banks to make up the shortfall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRead more about how the 19th Assembly is building its first budget\u00a0\nAs to her upcoming budget, she's promised to be \"creative\" and collaborate with regular MLAs, though she's yet to elaborate on what it will look like.\u00a0\nIn a briefing earlier this month, Wawzonek repeated that promise but remained cagey and declined to give out details ahead of the budget speech.\n\"It's an ongoing process to be creative, we have discussions going on,\" she said, noting much of the work on this budget happened as she was settling into the role after last fall's\u00a0election.\u00a0\n\"There's an opportunity to do more in the spring, after the budget address,\" she said.\u00a0\nThe debt limit does hem in her ability to be creative though, with about $300 million left before the government reaches its debt limit. It usually uses debt to pay for infrastructure projects that can't be paid through the government's surplus at the end of the year.\u00a0\n$300 million is about enough to pay for another highway, a new hospital, or run a government department for a year.\u00a0\n\"You could spend that in a heartbeat,\" Miltenberger said. \"We have infrastructure deficits in the billions of dollars, housing [deficits] in the billions of dollars \u2026 $300 million is chump change.\"\nThis all adds up to a difficult task for any finance minister, especially one who's brand new to the role. With Tuesday's budget address, Wawzonek will show how her government plans to take that challenge on.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1581305923926", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Martha Dillman", "title": "Greater Sudbury refutes report that suggests property taxes in the city amongst the highest in Ontario", "description": "New data by Zoocasa states Sudbury ranks 5th in the province for high tax rates", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/tax-rate-rankings-1.5233410", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4115726.1494868969!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/city-of-greater-sudbury-logo.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-08-02T09:00:00.066Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Greater Sudbury says a new report on municipal tax rates in Ontario doesn't tell the whole story.\nReal estate website Zoocasa has released data on the muncipalities with the highest and lowest property tax rates in the province.\nSudbury's in the top five out of 35, beat out only by Windsor, Thunder Bay, Sault Ste.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nMy goal as your MP will be to continue to listen and engage with our community to ensure our economy is strong, life is affordable, and we are protecting our environment for future generations.\nA Liberal government will continue to work to make life more affordable for Canadians. We lowered taxes on middle class Canadians and have a plan to give a hand-up to the most vulnerable in our society by making the first $15,000 of earned income tax-free, saving the average family nearly $600 a year and lifting 40,000 more people out of poverty.\u00a0\nBy working with communities, we created the National Housing Strategy and the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to respond to concerns about affordable housing.\nI meet with students regularly and know one of Waterloo's greatest strengths is our post-secondary institutions. A Liberal government will make university or college education more affordable, providing $1,200 more each year in Canada Student Grants. Additionally, to ensure the fiscal situation of students, we will assist with interest relief until graduates are earning $35,000/year.\nWe have a plan that looks out for middle-class Canadians and the most vulnerable, not one that gives tax cuts to millionaires.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOur plan to invest in the middle class and build an economy that works for everyone has had remarkable results. Since our government was elected in 2015, Canadians have created over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 about 75 per cent of them full-time \u2014 pushing unemployment to historic lows.\u00a0\nThanks to the tax-free Canadian Child Benefit and the middle-class tax cut, the typical middle-class family has more than $2,000 extra in their pockets every year. Our debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a downward trend and Canada's fiscal position is among the best in G7.\u00a0\nThere's no place like Waterloo to start a business, and that's why we've supported small businesses by lowering their tax rate from 11% in 2015 to 9% in 2019. Canada now has the lowest small business tax rate in the G7.\u00a0\nWe've also enhanced support for research and development which is especially important in a tech community like ours. If we are re-elected, we will create the Canada entrepreneur account to provide up to 2,000 entrepreneurs with as much as $50,000 each to launch their new businesses. Small businesses are our job creators and we are committed to working with them.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nToday in Canada, if you pollute, you pay. We've taken the bold step of putting a price on pollution with 90% of the money returning to the pockets of individuals and families to make greener, cleaner choices more affordable.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that we need to do even more. If re-elected, we have committed to legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. We are committed to transitioning to greener energy sources. To support this in a responsible way, we will ensure energy workers and communities shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.\nThe best way through the climate emergency is action, not inaction. We are committed to planting an additional 2 billion trees within the next 10 years and we will increase land and ocean protections by 25% by 2025. We must take climate change seriously to keep the world our children and grandchildren grow up in safe and liveable.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nUpon election four years ago, I chose to move the MP's office to Waterloo City Hall. Waterloo is the only riding that I know of in Canada where the MP, the MPP, and the mayor are all located in the same building. I believe that all levels of government should work better together for the good people of Waterloo.\nI've called Waterloo Region home all my life. I'm proud to be the child of immigrants and to have been educated right here in Waterloo. I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Science and have been employed since.\nOur government brought back the long-form census and we have returned to making decisions based on evidence, not ideology.\nWe have an incredible community. Over the past four years, I have connected our community's expertise in the work we have done as a country because as I always say, Canada needs more Waterloo. Over the past four years, we have worked together to bring investments to our community and showcased Waterloo and Canada to the world. I ask for your support and commit to continue working hard for you to represent our riding's interests in Ottawa as your MP.\nWebsite\nResponse not yet received.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI've spoken to people across Waterloo over the last several months and the vast majority of them are nervous about the future and ongoing threats related to the climate crisis.\u00a0\nThe Trudeau Liberal government hasn't done enough to fight the climate crisis and their purchasing of a pipeline was frankly irresponsible. And the Conservatives have no plan to do anything meaningful to address climate change and its consequences.\nWhen I speak to people, they're hopeful about the NDP's plan to address the climate crisis without leaving anyone behind. We will set our emissions target based on what scientists say is required to meet our Paris Agreement targets to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and invest in the jobs of the future.\nOur plan involves continuing to put a price on carbon, immediately ending fossil fuel subsidies, retrofitting homes and buildings across the country, transitioning to fully-electric transit and incentivizing the building and buying of electric vehicles.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere in Waterloo, people are feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, in part because of stagnant wages and rapidly increasing housing costs.\u00a0\nThe NDP has a comprehensive plan to address affordability. We would focus on reinvesting in public services like universal pharmacare and education. With universal pharmacare, families can save up to $500 per year. And by removing the interest on federal student loans, we will ease the transition of students from post-secondary education to the workforce.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the NDP has put forward a plan to invest in affordable housing, building 500,000 new units in the next 10 years. As MP, I would make sure that Waterloo gets its fair share.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe federal government needs to be doing so much more to tackle the climate crisis. Our collective future relies on it.\u00a0\nFirst, we need to get serious about meeting our Paris Agreement targets. We need to use scientifically based targets so that we have the highest chance of avoiding the catastrophic effects of climate change.\u00a0\nSecond, we need to start thinking about how we are going to transition our society to become net-zero. The federal government can be a leader here, starting with retrofitting all federal government buildings, electrifying government vehicles, and being a partner with municipalities to electrify and expand public transit fleets across the country.\u00a0\nThird, and most importantly, this transition needs to be just. Indigenous people need a seat at the table and the economic opportunities need to be spread fairly across society so that no one is left behind.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm Cree-Metis, with family roots in Montreal Lake First Nation in Treaty 6 Territory.\nI have years of experience fighting for meaningful change by advocating for social, economic, and environmental justice issues. Every day, I refine my advocacy skills by taking every opportunity to listen to and learn from those around me.\nI have a strong work ethic and I work hard to amplify community voices. If elected, my main priority as MP would be to listen to constituents, amplify their voices in Ottawa, and work in a non-partisan way to get good things done for Waterloo.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address\u00a0it?\nWe are one of Canada's technology champions. We need to attract and hold talent to build our lead. To do\u00a0this, we need to promote a system-level strategy that improves transportation the regional transportation network and helps control housing costs at the same time.\nWe need to support the universities that are actually driving regional growth and continue to build an arts and culture sector around our high-tech lead to attract more talent and more jobs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe cost of living problem is primarily in the housing/transportation nexus.\nThe key is to continue our forward-looking urban and regional planning and to win federal and provincial support for our infrastructure needed. More broadly, we in the region need to support a high speed rail system for the entires Quebec-Windsor corridor.\nWe also need to implement a national housing policy focused a massive expansion of social\u00a0 housing. I will work to strengthen our links with he relevant Federal agencies and decision makers.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to be clear \u2014 the climate emergency is the big threat\u00a0for the world and for K-W.\nAll our other great initiative will be undermined if we don't pick up our game in Canada and Ontario. My immediate task is to help people understand that we already have all the tools and technology we need, and that we can and must set much more ambitions targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a young mother and a systems design engineer. The first makes me very committed to improving the world and the other teaches me to look for and find solutions that really work.\u00a0\nSerious problems take serious thinking and serious commitment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI thought long about the top issue facing our riding and my thoughts kept going back to it depends who you ask. I've addressed the tax burden and our landfill crisis below.\nFor the commuters the biggest issue is our transportation infrastructure. It is mind-boggling why K-W does not have high speed transport to the Pearson International Airport, and throughout the Toronto to Montreal corridor. We must stop expecting our big government to provide what for decades it has failed to do and look at handing the challenges over to the private sector to deliver.\u00a0By doing so, we eliminate the need for tax increases and only those who choose to use it will pay.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe PPC has a plan to balance the budget in two years, a plan for bold tax reform and policy to reduce prices of dairy, poultry, eggs and all goods produced in Canada and sold to neighbouring provinces. The PPC will also eliminate all capital gains taxes allowing investors big and small to make money while stimulating the economy.\nThe PPC will balance the budget by eliminating the billions of dollars spent on corporate cronyism, bail-outs, subsidies and all forms of corporate welfare; and by eliminating the billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars that are sent to other countries for unaccountable social causes. This foreign aid rarely ends up in the hands of those in need.\nThe PPC will increase the personal exemption to $15,000 and have a flat tax of 15% on income up to $100,000 and a flat rate of 25% on income over $100,000.\nThe PPC will eliminate supply management, the dairy cartel, which makes Canadians pay 400% more for milk, eggs, dairy and poultry.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe PPC will end inter-provincial trade barriers so we can buy product made in Canada without the punitive costs and barriers to trading among provinces.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur region is facing a trash and landfill crisis. As a community our biggest issue is what is going to happen in a few short years when the Erb Street landfill permanently closes. There is no rational back-up plan.\u00a0\nOur federal government doesn't know what to do with our trash other than to drive it to our port cities, put it in shipping containers and send it to third world nations who either send it back (the Philippines), burn it producing toxic fumes, or dump it in the ocean (which is why our Canadian recycle products are floating in the south Pacific).\u00a0\nThe green energy proponents have no plan for the end of life disposal of highly toxic electric car batteries, solar panels and windmills.\nThe PPC will focus on local solutions to local environmental issues. Accountability only works when power is decentralized. The PPC policy prioritizes clean and safe drinking water for all, and clean and safe air for all. On these issues we have seen that our federal government tends to stand in the way of innovation, stuck in old infrastructure and old way to do things, and simply not doing anything.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nIn 2018, the average Canadian family paid a whopping $40,000 in taxes while it paid only $32,000 toward food, shelter and clothing. We also know that\u00a0the average Canadian household is within $200 per month of bankruptcy. Household and government debt are at an all-time high.\u00a0Many families are struggling to make ends meet with no income left to pay for emergencies, job loss, prescription drugs, never mind a vacation. It is wrong that so much is paid for taxes with little access to social services and healthcare.\nI would like to get busy implementing the People's Party platform, policy and principles.\u00a0I would like to come back in four\u00a0years as your MP with a record of having accomplished what the People's Party's set out to do. We need bold reforms and to get back to our basic values as Canadians.\nI would be honoured to serve as your Member of Parliament for the riding of Waterloo.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Patrick Butler", "title": "'Sexy' Galway site for new French school nearly twice price of Mount Pearl option", "description": "Francophone school board argues $1.5M difference justified", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/sexy-galway-french-francophone-school-1.5178117", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5178135.1560816082!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kim-christianson-csfp.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 18, 2019 7:00 AM NT", "2019-06-18T11:57:33.575Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Newfoundland and Labrador's French school board says \"sexy\" Galway is the ideal location for a new school in the St. John's area. But it won't come cheap, with land costing more than $3 million \u2014 nearly twice as much as a second construction site the board considered in Mount Pearl.\nAccording to documents prepared in October, purchasing a seven-acre property in the Galway development \u2014 referred to in the documents as \"sexy, fancy, modern\" \u2014 would cost the province $3.15 million. Another property of the same size in Mount Pearl, a location deemed \"less nice,\" would cost $1.67 million.\nThose documents were prepared\u00a0by Kim Christianson, the Conseil scolaire francophone provincial de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador's director of education.\nDespite the difference in price, the board's directors unanimously voted in 2018 to recommend the province acquire the Galway site.\nChristianson said the new K-12 school's location is of \"fundamental\" importance, and the Galway site would help attract future students from the west end of St. John's, as well as nearby Paradise and Conception Bay South.\n\"I think, given our justifications, if there is a difference in costs, the board of directors of the school board is prepared to accept this difference,\" Christianson said.\nBut the analysis Christianson prepared in 2018 states both the Galway and Mount Pearl locations are in the right geographic area\u00a0and could increase the board's enrolment. In an interview with CBC Radio-Canada, Christianson added that no matter where the new school is built, most students will need to be bused to the facility.\nThe school board argued\u00a0the property it considered in Mount Pearl is hillier than the Galway location and less accessible to school buses. It also said the Galway site on Beaumont Hamel Way is closer to services such as shopping centres and coffee shops, even though the massive housing and commercial development remains \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 largely void of such amenities.\n\"By the time the school is built, there will be more services around the school,\" said Christianson. \"We are seeing several businesses currently setting up and we can see things are expanding. We think that with a new\u00a0school, this development will continue.\"\nChristianson also said the Mount Pearl property, located on Masonic Drive, could not be expanded in the event the board required more space.\nBut the $46.3-million school and community centre proposed by the board would already have space for 500 students \u2014 more than the French school board's entire provincewide enrolment for 2018-19.\nEmail exchanges obtained by Radio-Canada show that DewCor, the company owned by former premier Danny Williams that is behind the Galway development, offered the school board a 10 per cent discount if the province purchased the property by June 30. That deal offers the land at $450,000 per acre before tax.\nThe school board still needs the provincial government's approval before it can proceed with purchasing land and beginning construction on a second permanent school for the St. John's area.\nBoard officials had hoped to receive that go-ahead and funding in the most recent budget. Instead, they received $2.8 million to continue planning the new structure.\nEducation Minister Brian Warr\u00a0would not comment\u00a0on the board's decision to choose the land in Galway.\n\"I'm sure that locations have their strengths and their weaknesses, and I give them credit for making their choice and we will see where it goes,\" he said Monday, adding that the Department of Transportation and Works will analyze the project.\u00a0\u00a0\nWarr\u00a0refused to comment on the feasibility of the $46.3 million project either.\n''Again, that is a decision that is not left to me or my department, it's a decision that will be left to a cabinet and treasury board as we see it going forward,'' he said.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0school board hopes the new\u00a0facility will be open in time for the 2022-23 school year.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2655852949", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Alex Brockman", "title": "'Nothing short of disappointing': North a low priority in federal election", "description": "Northerners say they've heard promises, but see little action on critical issues", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/federal-election-northern-canada-1.5314945", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315000.1570644148!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/lawrence-ruben-paulatuk.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Oct 15, 2019 4:00 AM CT", "2019-10-15T10:00:00.018Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Lawrence Ruben sighs as he wraps his hands around his coffee mug.

After a decade of seeing good ideas get stuck in the mud, he says he's skeptical about promises from politicians \u2014 from any party.\u00a0\n\"It's getting to the point where [I'll say]: 'You make this promise, you make it work or I'm going to ignore you. I'm going to talk to somebody else,'\" he said. \"That's why I try to talk to ministers every chance I get.\"\u00a0\nThough Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer visited Iqaluit and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May visited Yellowknife this summer, on Tuesday, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was the first leader to come to the North since the campaign began.\u00a0\nDuring his three hours in Iqaluit, Trudeau defended his record in the North, pitched\u00a0voters on the Liberal climate change plan and spoke about the party's proposal to expand access to Northern travel benefits, while acknowledging the challenges many face.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Northerners still face unacceptably high prices and cost of living and we will do more,\" Trudeau said.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut he did not announce any plans for a drastically new or different direction for the North.\u00a0\nWithin party platforms, the Liberals, Greens\u00a0and NDP say they will assist communities in reducing reliance on diesel\u00a0and help them adapt to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe NDP also commits to improving the food subsidy program Nutrition North, investing in search and rescue and creating a Northern Infrastructure Fund to \"fast track investment.\"\nThe Conservatives, meanwhile, vow\u00a0to revisit resource revenue formulas, promising the three territories will be entitled to 100 per cent of resource revenues by 2027. Currently, the N.W.T. receives just 50 per cent, and Yukon and Nunavut are limited to lesser amounts.\nParties may feel there isn't much payoff in spending time and money addressing the North, considering there are fewer than 120,000 people and only three seats in Parliament spread across Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Yukon.\u00a0\u00a0\nRob Huebert, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, sees this as a missed opportunity to have a national debate on critical topics related to the Arctic.\u00a0\nTo him, there are a number of unresolved questions in the North that need serious discussion.\u00a0\nHe listed a few he'd have liked to see tackled, such as:\u00a0\n\"You pick any one of these issues, they're important. And the politicians just attack each other,\" Huebert said. \"It's nothing short of disappointing.\u00a0\n\"I suspect part of the reason we don't see parties coming up with an answer to these kinds of questions is [they are] very difficult answers to provide,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"But isn't that what elections are supposed to be about?\"\u00a0\nThough he's disappointed the campaign is focusing so much on the individual leaders, he's not surprised, seeing how the campaign has shaped up so far.\u00a0\n\"It's frustrating, I wish we could count for more and see some form of discourse,\" he said.\u00a0\nIn Yellowknife, Mayor Rebecca Alty said she too isn't seeing much discourse about the North, though she expected that from the beginning.\u00a0\n\"Politics is at play,\" she said. \"They're catering their message to garner as much interest as possible.\"\u00a0\nInstead of focusing on the leaders, Alty's parsed the\u00a0party platforms to find out where northern programs are mentioned and looked to see how national policy changes would apply to people in Yellowknife.\u00a0\nCity officials have sent out questionnaires to the five candidates for the N.W.T. to see how they would address issues like addictions, housing, community infrastructure\u00a0and climate change.\u00a0\n\"That's their opportunity to go through their 200-page platforms and pull out the stuff that's of interest to Yellowknifers.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBack in Paulatuk, Bill Kudlak's building himself a shelter out of whatever wood he can salvage, and canvas tent material.

Residents across the North can find encouragement in Trudeau's acknowledgement of long-standing concerns \u2014 and his repeated commitment to find \"predictable and sufficient funding\" to address them.\nIn the details of the mandate and in a uniform introduction, the letters repeatedly emphasize a desire for closer relationships with Indigenous governments.\n\"There remains no more important relationship to me and to Canada than the one with Indigenous peoples,\" reads Trudeau's uniform introduction.\n\"I am directing every single minister to determine what they can do in their specific portfolio to accelerate and build on the progress we have made with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis.\"\nEarly headlines on the mandate letters singled out a commitment made in the letter to Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal to increase the Northern Residents Deduction for travel costs to at least $1,200.\nLarry Bagnell, the Liberal MP for Yukon, said the program would also expand eligibility to include northern residents, like self-employed people, who do not receive a travel benefit from their employer.\n\"Why should one person get it in the North, just because their employer puts it on their T4 slip, and another one doesn't?\" said Bagnell.\n\"This way, everyone will be eligible.\"\nA bigger tax break will be nice for northerners struggling with airfares that regularly run into the thousands.\nBut many of the letters' other commitments are much wider-reaching.\nOutside of Nunavut, northern premiers are likely to be encouraged by a mandate to support infrastructure projects in the North.\nThe letter to Vandal asks him to expand the scope of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency's work to include funding \"foundational economic infrastructure such as roads and visitor centres.\"\nThat opens up a new pot of funding for tourism development in the N.W.T., and for investment in the $700-million Mackenzie Valley Highway.\nThe letter also asks the minister to \"support territorial planning for hydroelectricity projects,\" which presumably includes the N.W.T.'s Taltson Hydroelectricity Expansion Project, with its estimated price tag of $1.2 billion.\nThe N.W.T. and Yukon will both benefit from commitments to finalize the Northern Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program,\u00a0which provides funding \u2014 and creates jobs \u2014 to clean up toxic abandoned mines.\nRemote communities in all three territories are also likely to benefit from an instruction to Marc Miller, minister of Indigenous Services, to help communities transition from diesel-fuelled power to clean energy alternatives by 2030.\nAnd Indigenous leadership across the North will be curious about the mandate to establish \"a new national benefits-sharing framework for major resource projects on Indigenous territory.\"\u00a0\nTerritorial governments will likely want a say in developing that framework, but it could be an opportunity to address widely-perceived shortcomings in existing impact benefit agreements.\nNorthern Affairs Minister Vandal will also have to support the development of new universities in the Yukon and N.W.T.\nBoth territories are in the process of transforming colleges into accredited polytechnic universities, and Trudeau's mandate letter commits the minister to ensuring \"a robust system of post-secondary education\" exists in the North at the end of it.\nResearchers in the North could benefit from Vandal's mandate also.\nThe minister is asked to accommodate growing demand at the Polar Continental Shelf Program, which helps manage research in the Arctic, and modernize the Eureka Weather Station some 400 kilometres north of Grise Fiord, Nunavut.\nSome more general items in the mandate letters will be of interest to territorial governments looking to devolve services to Indigenous governments.\nTrudeau instructed Miller to implement Bill C-92, which would hand over control of child and family services to First Nations. Crucially, it also specifies ensuring \"long-term predictable and sufficient funding\" to fund those services, so First Nations are not left with an unpayable tab.\nThe letter also briefly mentions working with Indigenous communities on the development of local housing policies, something that has been a point of conflict between Indigenous communities\u00a0and the territorial government in the N.W.T.\nThe mandate for Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett reaffirms the government's commitment to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \u2014 a move the N.W.T. government listed among its priorities.\nBennett will also oversee the creation of a new National Treaty Commissioner's Office that will help direct \"the ongoing review, maintenance and enforcement of Canada's treaty obligations.\"\nLakeshore and coastal communities in Nunavut and the N.W.T. may also benefit from the mandate given to Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard Bernadette Jordan.\nIt instructs Jordan to work with local and Indigenous partners on developing a \"blue economy\" strategy, including specific planning for \"small craft\" harbours.\nThat could be music to the ears of residents in Hay River, N.W.T. They have been waiting for years for federal funding to begin a $10 million dredging and revitalization project.\nLast but not least, the mandate for Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault asks him to find \"long-term predictable and sufficient funding to support\" the Indigenous Languages Act.\nThat act came under fire for failing to protect Inuktut language rights in Nunavut.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1555640899939", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Andrew Lupton", "title": "Plan for new Woodstock Sikh temple gets boost from developer's land donation", "description": "Punjabi community grateful for donation, now turns to raising money for construction costs", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/woodstock-sikh-temple-1.5324777", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324793.1571413682!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/woodstock-sikh-temple.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 20, 2019 4:01 AM ET", "2019-10-20T08:01:00.583Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "From the roadside, the Havelock\u00a0Corners subdivision in\u00a0Woodstock, Ont.,\u00a0appears much like any other housing development popping up on the outskirts of communities across Canada.\u00a0\nBuyers are snapping up new brick homes that line freshly paved streets as the project, soon heading into its fifth stage, expands over farm fields along Oxford Road 17 at Woodstock's northern boundary.\u00a0\nWhat's different here is that about 80 per cent of the homes sold in Havelock Corners have been bought by members of Woodstock's fast-growing Punjabi/Sikh community.\u00a0\nThe sales are so brisk that\u00a0Matthew Castelli, president of the project's developer Kingsmen\u00a0Group, is donating 2.8 acres (1.1 hectares) of an upcoming phase\u00a0as a site for Woodstock's first Gurudwara Sahib (Sikh temple).\u00a0\n\"Most of my buyers are of Sikh origin,\" said Castelli, whose company is based in Vaughan. \"So for\u00a0what they've done for me ... for me to give them the land for free, was something I wanted to do.\"\u00a0\nCastelli said he sees in the Sikh community parallels \u2014 hard work, an entrepreneurial spirit \u2014 shown by\u00a0his ancestors who came to Canada from Italy decades ago.\u00a0\nTo understand what's creating the demand for both housing\u00a0and a Sikh temple in Woodstock,\u00a0Darshan 'Woody' Bedi\u00a0offers some important perspective.\u00a0\nHe immigrated to Canada from India\u00a0in 1979\u00a0settling in Brampton, a longtime landing spot for Sikh immigrants. Bedi got married, started a family and for 10 years drove a taxi. Then\u00a0in 1989,\u00a0he saw an opportunity to buy a gas station\u00a0in Woodstock. He snapped it up and has never looked back.\nWhen Bedi first arrived in Woodstock 30 years ago,\u00a0the community was about\u00a010 to 15 families. But starting in about 2014, the numbers began to grow.\u00a0\n\"People were moving to Guelph, then they were moving to Kitchener\u00a0then they were all filled in and I think people moved here, especially people in the trucking industry,\" he said.\nWhile Sikhs are known for their presence in Ontario's taxi cab industry, Bedi says many have switched over to trucking, where the money tends to be better. Woodstock's location at the intersection of Highways 401 and 403 makes it an attractive location for truckers.\u00a0\nIn March, Charger Logistics, a fast-growing Brampton-based trucking company, opened a state-of-the-art branch location in Woodstock. The company was founded by a Sikh man and Sikhs make up a significant part of its 2,000 employees. The Brampton-based company now has 500 trucks and locations across North America.\nBedi\u00a0has \u00a0found Woodstock a welcoming community, one worthy of its motto the \"Friendly City.\"\u00a0\n\"I wore a turban as a younger man working here, and I never had any problem,\" he said.\u00a0\nBedi estimates that about 700 people in the\u00a0Sikh/Punjabi community now call Woodstock home. During a drive around town with CBC\u00a0News, he pointed out Sikh-owned businesses, everything from dental offices, to gas stations to pizza restaurants.\u00a0\nMayor Trevor Birch says Sikhs have quickly become active members of the community\u00a0not just as business owners, but also serving as members of city boards and committees.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They have been great ambassadors within the Punjabi community,\" said Birch, who regularly attends\u00a0events hosted by members of Woodstock's Sikh/Punjabi community. \"I have been enjoying getting to know them ... I see them integrating with other community groups here.\"\nAnd while Sikhs are finding a home in Woodstock, they don't yet have a temple.\u00a0Bedi says\u00a0it's\u00a0badly needed, not only as a place of worship but also as a community gathering spot.\nHe said having the land\u00a0gives them a huge head start.\n\"The community is very grateful to Kingsmen for this gift,\" said Bedi.\u00a0\nThey've raised about half the $1.5 million they estimate they'll needed to build the temple, which will be about 10,000 square feet in size.\u00a0\nFor now, a large sign almost obscured by head-high corn announces the site on Oxford Road 17 as the future home of the temple.\nBedi says he's not worried about the community's ability to raise the rest of the money. They're selling family membership and gathering monthly donations and hope to start construction next year. Once that happens, he expects the pace of donations will pick up.\u00a0\n\"People are asking me when it will be built and if we had a choice, we'd be opening it tomorrow,\" he said.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Garrett Hinchey", "title": "Kam Lake candidates trade cost of living solutions in community debate", "description": "6 candidates in crowded field find common ground on most issues", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/kam-lake-debate-nwt-votes-1.5287848", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287852.1568786451!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kam-lake-debate.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 18, 2019 7:55 AM CT", "2019-09-18T13:55:46.202Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Six candidates running for MLA in Yellowknife's Kam Lake riding struggled to differentiate themselves from one another in a Tuesday evening debate, though they did offer some innovative ideas to decrease the N.W.T.'s cost of living.\nHosted at N.J.

This is how we survive.\"\nResponding next, Yellowknife city councillor Rommel Silverio said that the decision on the power franchise would come when the contract expires in 2020, but \"we don't want to be like Hay River right now,\" referring to\u00a0ongoing court battles\u00a0in that community.\u00a0\nInstead, Silverio's ideas on reducing the cost of living centre\u00a0around growing the population\u00a0\u2014 an idea that he says would lead to more federal formula funding and increase the tax base.\n\"I firmly believe that if we are able to grow our population, then we will get some relief,\" he said.\nSilverio touted growth through supporting immigration to Yellowknife, and attracting new small businesses to grow the economy.\nYWCA president Cherish Winsor, responding next, said the two most important points were \"keeping our economy strong, and keeping our population up.\"\n\"We need to focus on keeping families here and having the infrastructure for families to stay. That means increasing infrastructure. That means affordable housing,\" she said.\nWinsor called social supports, such as\u00a0government housing, \"band-aid solutions that do nothing for the cost of living,\" instead saying she wants to look at increasing entry-level housing units for singles and seniors.\u00a0\n\"The biggest need in Yellowknife is for bachelor units, or single bedroom units ... we don't have that.\"\nWinsor also iterated her support for universal childcare and a guaranteed income program.\nCaitlin Cleveland, a policy analyst and entrepreneur, was the last to respond to the question. She too focused on growing and maintaining population, expanding\u00a0on Silverio's comments on immigration by saying the government could focus on reconnecting immigrant families, and working to provide them meaningful employment once they arrive.\u00a0\nCleveland also suggested that the government look at its student financial assistance program.\n\"When we first put the program together, we wanted our students to go to university,\" she said. \"Now we want them to go to university, and we want them to come home.

Economists suggest Canada's unemployment rate right now is likely around 20 per cent. Earlier this week, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney unveiled projections for the province's unemployment rate to reach 25 per cent.

Over the past week, laboratory backlogs for coronavirus testing have cleared, but restrictions on who will be tested still remain in most parts of Canada.

This is how we survive.\"\nResponding next, Yellowknife city councillor Rommel Silverio said that the decision on the power franchise would come when the contract expires in 2020, but \"we don't want to be like Hay River right now,\" referring to\u00a0ongoing court battles\u00a0in that community.\u00a0\nInstead, Silverio's ideas on reducing the cost of living centre\u00a0around growing the population\u00a0\u2014 an idea that he says would lead to more federal formula funding and increase the tax base.\n\"I firmly believe that if we are able to grow our population, then we will get some relief,\" he said.\nSilverio touted growth through supporting immigration to Yellowknife, and attracting new small businesses to grow the economy.\nYWCA president Cherish Winsor, responding next, said the two most important points were \"keeping our economy strong, and keeping our population up.\"\n\"We need to focus on keeping families here and having the infrastructure for families to stay. That means increasing infrastructure. That means affordable housing,\" she said.\nWinsor called social supports, such as\u00a0government housing, \"band-aid solutions that do nothing for the cost of living,\" instead saying she wants to look at increasing entry-level housing units for singles and seniors.\u00a0\n\"The biggest need in Yellowknife is for bachelor units, or single bedroom units ... we don't have that.\"\nWinsor also iterated her support for universal childcare and a guaranteed income program.\nCaitlin Cleveland, a policy analyst and entrepreneur, was the last to respond to the question. She too focused on growing and maintaining population, expanding\u00a0on Silverio's comments on immigration by saying the government could focus on reconnecting immigrant families, and working to provide them meaningful employment once they arrive.\u00a0\nCleveland also suggested that the government look at its student financial assistance program.\n\"When we first put the program together, we wanted our students to go to university,\" she said. \"Now we want them to go to university, and we want them to come home. So how can we change the program so that we can attract our students to come home and work for us here?\"\nThe debate, live streamed on OpenNWT's Facebook page, was one of two on the night, as candidates in the Yellowknife North riding took part in an event at St. Patrick high school\u00a0gymnasium. That debate was also streamed live.\u00a0\nThe territorial election is Oct. 1.\n"}, {"author": "Mark Ting", "title": "How high is too high?

Therefore, comparing mill rates is like comparing apples to oranges.\nIt will be interesting to see how the tax hike will affect renters. Those currently renting won't be affected too much as B.C. limits rent increases to the cost of inflation.\nAlso, the city is planning on using some of the revenue generated by the tax increase to fund new affordable housing, tenant relocation and tenant protective policies.\nThe news isn't as good for landlords or new renters.\u00a0Landlords add up all their costs such as financing, property taxes, strata, utilities and maintenance.\u00a0Then, if the market allows it, set their rents hoping to cover their expenses. Therefore, a large increase in property tax ultimately be will be passed down to the renter in the form of higher rent.\nCurrently, many landlords are factoring in a bigger buffer into their cost analysis.\u00a0The provincial government\u00a0restricts rent increases to the rate of inflation, which for 2020 is 2.6 per cent.\nThis limitation is problematic for landlords as many of their expenses are increasing by five\u00a0to 10 per cent. I'd anticipate that some are planning to increase their rents to new renters or economize elsewhere by spending less on maintenance.\nAs this is a draft budget, there is time for the City of Vancouver to make changes and lower the property tax hike, perhaps somewhere in the seven per cent\u00a0range.\nPsychologically, seeing a tax drop from 9.3 per cent down to seven\u00a0per cent\u00a0is a lot more palatable than experiencing an increase from 4.5 per cent\u00a0(the 2019 rate increase) to seven\u00a0per cent.\nThis is a common tactic used in sales and negotiations which, in the field of behaviour finance is referred to as \"anchoring bias.\"\nJust five years ago, Vancouver's property tax increases were roughly in line with the rate of inflation, around two\u00a0per cent. But in 2017, they jumped to four per cent, and are now proposed to be 8.2 per cent\u00a0for 2020.\u00a0\nThis is a worrying inflationary trend as it far exceeds most homeowners' salaries or landlords' profit margins.\u00a0\nWhen I reviewed the 600-plus-page draft Vancouver budget, it read like a highlight reel of the city's dreams and initiatives.\u00a0However, critically, it lacked a cost/benefit breakdown for each initiative.\nI understand that it is expensive to run a city and that Vancouver is \"only\" asking for an additional $354 from the owner of median single-family home.\nHowever, between this and all the other increases in fees, such as\u00a0Hydro and ICBC\u00a0increases,\u00a0homeowners are tapped out. \u00a0\nRather than relying on homeowners as a captive and endless source of revenues, the city should instead focus on cutting costs, adjusting its\u00a0goals and finding new sources of revenue.\nI'm not against property tax increases. I know they are necessary.\nBut let's makes it easier for homeowners with smaller, more gradual increases as they too have a budget that needs to be balanced.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Guelph candidates on top issues facing city, cost of living, environment", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/guelph-candidate-surveys-federal-election-1.5313048", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4748611.1556296425!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/petrie-building-downtown-guelph.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T12:17:23.861Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Waterloo, people will have a choice between nine candidates.\nThe candidates in Guelph are:\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue facing Guelph is the threat posed by global climate change.\nIn the last four years, the Liberal Government put a price on pollution, banned single use plastics, and protected great swaths of our land and oceans. Our carbon pricing system not only reduces emissions but also puts money back in the pockets of more Canadian families. Battling climate change takes courage and planning, grassroots leadership, and government investment. I am proud to represent a political team that is fighting for a better future. The Liberal Party will build on our progress, and continue to take ambitious action to fight climate change: committing Canada to net zero by 2050, planting two billion trees, and making our country the best place in the world to build a clean tech company.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI know that the changing nature of work can present a challenge for our people to find and keep a good job, even in this time of record low unemployment. As Guelph's Member of Parliament, my personal commitment to continuing to make life affordable revolves around three goals: environmental protection, economic prosperity, and social inclusion.\nTo make life more affordable for Canadian families, I support a plan that lowers taxes for middle class families. With an increase in the Basic Personal Amount, Canadians will not pay federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. Changes to the Canada Child Benefit, CPP, and OAS will make sure that the youngest and oldest members of our society have the support they need.\nI also favour moving the Canadian economy into the carbon neutral future. Providing interest-free loans of up to $40,000 means landlords and other homeowners can improve their properties to make them more energy efficient. Lowering taxes for cleantech companies will create a strong incentive for business to set up shop in Canada and help make Canada a strong leader with green innovation.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe Liberal government recognizes that climate change is real, and scientific research has indicated the risk this represents to our future.\nCanadians expect forward-looking leadership, which is why the Liberal team has committed Canada to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means we will enact measures not only to reduce carbon emissions, but also to offset emissions with actions that will remove carbon from the atmosphere. As a result, we will greatly increase Canada's forests and protect more of Canada's lands and oceans. The Liberal government will begin a program to plant two billion trees over the next 10 years. We will also protect 25% of Canada's lands and 25% of Canada's oceans by 2025.\nThe Liberal government will also continue to lead with a price on pollution and support for making the transition to a green economy. A $5-billion Clean Power Fund will help northern, remote, and Indigenous communities become less reliant on diesel-fueled power and will promote the electrification of Canadian industries using our own sources of clean and renewable power, like hydro, solar and wind.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nWith a background in community benefit organizations and as former President of the Guelph Chamber of Commerce, I understand the interests and the concerns of our community. Every day I work hard to respond to the needs of Guelph constituents. Helping to resolve problems with immigration, pensions, and employment insurance is a gratifying part of being the MP. Equally important is advancing policies to address the climate crisis, create a positive environment for employment, and improve life for our families.\nA key part of my job as MP is connecting individuals and institutions with the resources they need from the federal government. As a member of the House of Commons' Agriculture Committee, I have presented local Guelph ideas that can respond to national concerns. For instance, researchers at the University of Guelph made major contributions to the creation of the new National Food Policy.\nWorking collaboratively with others toward a common goal has been a cornerstone of my professional life. Being your MP is a reflection of all I have learned. While politics is often seen only through an adversarial lens, it demands significant collaboration and teamwork.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI have been knocking on doors and speaking to the residents of Guelph and one thing has remained clear, life has gotten more expensive under Justin Trudeau. Two thirds of Canadians feel that they either can't pay their bills \u2013 or feel that they have nothing left over at the end of the month after they do. Gasoline. Groceries. Home heating. Real estate. Debt. Everything keeps getting more expensive.\u00a0\nAn Andrew Scheer-led Conservative government will implement a Children's Fitness Tax Credit and a Children's Arts and Learning Tax Credit. These Tax Credits will put more money in parent's pockets while helping their kids do well in school, learn a new skill, and reach their greatest potential.\u00a0\nA Conservative government will remove federal income tax from Employment Insurance (EI) maternity benefits by providing a non-refundable tax credit of 15 percent for any income earned under these two programs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Conservative plan is a plan that means real results for Canadians and their families.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nToday, Canadians are under pressure and worried about their future. Their dreams are getting further and further out of reach. They are looking for help. Trudeau has proven he cannot be trusted to deliver it. If Trudeau is re-elected and given four more years his endless deficits will force him to raise taxes even higher.\u00a0\nA Conservative government will provide a Universal Tax Credit to all hardworking taxpayers, will remove the GST off home heating and home energy costs, and will make transit passes more affordable by implementing the Green Tax Credit for Public Transit.\u00a0\nLife is expensive enough without the government costing you more. A new Conservative government will live within its means and put more money in the pockets of Canadians so they can get ahead, not just get by.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nCanadians trusted Justin Trudeau when he said he would protect the environment and lower Canada's emissions. Instead, all they got was a carbon tax. Not only is Canada failing to hit our Paris Agreement targets, we are getting further and further away.\u00a0\nAs an environmental policy, the carbon tax is a failure of epic proportions. It makes virtually no contribution to the global fight against climate change. And it only makes life more expensive for Canadian families and small businesses.\u00a0\nWe should all be concerned about climate change \u2013 about the kind of planet we will leave to future generations. A Real Plan to Protect Our Environment is built on three guiding principles:\u00a0\nThis plan is the most comprehensive environmental platform ever put forward by a political party in Canada.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nBorn in New Delhi, India, I have come to Canada to work hard to build a life for myself and my family. I am a veterinarian licensed in toxicology, and work as the chief science officer for a Canadian clean-technology company providing eco-friendly and safer alternatives to petroleum-based products.\u00a0\nI am passionate about my community, and willing to work tirelessly to represent the concerns of the residents of Guelph in Ottawa. I am running to champion the residents of Guelph so they can get ahead, not just get by.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nIt is difficult to choose one issue when so many of the challenges facing Guelph are intertwined.\nWe are dealing with a housing and homelessness crisis, an opioid crisis, and threat of private control of our drinking water supply. That is all without even mentioning the climate crisis that we are all facing, and the pressure to privatize water supplies.\nReally, I think what it comes down to is cost of living and whether governments are working for people or working for the powerful. We need to support people so they can make decisions in life that work for them \u2014 and that means taking money that goes to big polluters and big pharmaceutical companies, and bringing it back to ordinary working people in Canada.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI am a mental health nurse\u00a0and in my work I have seen firsthand how difficult life has become for people. It induces stress, anxiety, and depression and cost of living is certainly a contributing factor to rising rates of these mental struggles.\nWe do need more mental health services, but it's not just that \u2014 we also need to address the root causes. Pharmacare, childcare, dental care, affordable housing units, living wages, pension security, and rental subsidies are all things missing from our society right now that should be provided, so that people can afford to live again.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have to ensure a fair transition for workers \u2014 not just those who work directly in oil and gas, but also all those communities in Alberta, Sarnia, and others, whose economy revolves around the existence of their local industries.\nI know that many people in Sarnia have already started working out of town at places like Bruce Nuclear because there is not enough work left for them at home, and local restaurants are suffering due to this. I find that troubling. People should be able to be supported at home and contribute to where they have chosen to live.\nMy party is going to use things like the money saved from fossil fuel subsidies and the climate bank to create 300,000 clean, good jobs for people who need them, as close to their homes as possible.\nWe\u00a0also recognize that any climate action done by one government could be overturned by a future majority government that doesn't believe in climate science \u2014 that's why we need proportional representation, to create a system of minority governments that are incentivized to work together for the common good, not just to pander to one sector of Canadian society or another. We will also create an independent climate accountability office to hold future governments' feet to the fire on science-based climate targets.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a mental health nurse. It's a tough job. I want people to know how political my work is.\nWorking on the front line of the healthcare system means I see a lot of people who our systems have failed, whether it's the person whose addiction was treated as a crime instead of an illness, or the Indigenous mother whose children have been taken away from her, or the young person who doesn't want to have kids because they're not sure we'll make it out of the climate crisis. The one responsibility of a nurse is to protect the public, and that's why I decided to run.\nI want to give hope to all those people on the margins, hope that they will have a representative in government who can listen to them no matter where they're coming from. I want people to know I'm committed to working with the NDP to make life in Canada liveable again.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThere are several issues facing the people of Guelph, affordable house, climate change and a lack of mental health funding. The people in Guelph feel that none of these issues can be meaningfully tackled with a government that acts without integrity or accountability to the issues that matter to us. It's important that citizens have trust in their government and know the nation's leadership is accountable to the people.\u00a0\u00a0\nBroken promises, corporate interference and conflicts of interests at the highest levels of our government, have eroded the people's trust that government will act decisively on our most pressing issues. Greens seek to hold the balance of responsibility in a minority government to keep government accountable to its promises.\nWe would bring in new standards of transparency and an all party inner cabinet to encourage collaborative action. We would also create a Council of Canadian Governments ensuring an equal voice to Federal, Provincial, Municipalities, and First Nations representatives.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nHere's what we know:\nHome prices have risen by about 30% in Guelph since 2015\u00a0 the last election.\nHousehold incomes have not risen by 30% since the last election, so being able to afford a home, or make rent, has become near impossible for some.\nWe need to legislate housing as a legally protected human right for everyone in Canada. We need to increase the number of affordable housing units, and begin to roll back the causes of these rising costs.\nThe Green Party will deliver policy innovations, such as encouraging two family dwellings to address affordability, build a denser community, provide rental income opportunities and are good for the planet.\nAs we transition to a low carbon economy, we need to ensure no one is left behind and that means establishing a guaranteed livable income (GLI).\nThe principle of the GLI is simple: to establish an income floor below which no Canadian could fall, but with incentives recipients to continue working and to earn more. A GLI would provide a regular payment to every Canadian, at a level above the poverty line and ensure that no person's income falls below what is necessary for health, life and dignity.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Green party's climate plan Mission Possible calls for a 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We must immediately end oil imports and support our Canadian workers.\u00a0\nThe Green plan to phase out fossil fuels must be done in a way that's fair to workers and builds a bridge to a low carbon economy where no one is left behind. Our energy and transportation network will be drawing from 100 per cent renewable energy within 10 years.\u00a0\nTo accomplish this, we all need to put aside partisanship and work together on what the evidence tells us we need to do. Climate change is too important to be a partisan issue. That's why we need an inner cabinet consisting of all parties to have everyone work together to ensure the climate is no longer treated like a political football.\u00a0\nThis is about the welfare of Canada and the entire planet.\u00a0\nWe will provide zero-interest loans for homes and businesses to complete energy upgrades based on EnerGuide criteria.\u00a0\nPeople want to do the right thing and save money as they save energy.\u00a0 And we can do this without creating more government debt.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\u00a0\nI've transformed my life from a carbon based lifestyle to the low carbon economy, 10 years ago I was building engines for Cadillac and stuck in traffic. Since then, I've built a company right here in Guelph installing climate solutions and creating great jobs of the future.\u00a0\nI've taken leadership on cross party policy building on electoral reform, and climate change action across municipal, provincial and federal governments, engaging people from youth to seniors.\u00a0\nAs a Green I'm devoted to building a healthy and inclusive social environment, one that puts health care, affordable housing, and social justice at the very core of our mission. I have been listening to our youth.\u00a0 OurTime.ca - the youth led organization for Canada's Green New Deal has endorsed me as their candidate because I have been living the values of decisive climate action, addressing inequality and creating good work.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nHome costs / Cost of Living\u00a0\nThe People's Party of Canada is the only party promising to address the root cause of rapidly increasing housing costs. The cause of this problem is supply and demand. Last year Toronto had a demand of 50,000 rental units, but only had 37,000 units available. This lack of supply results in increased rent and drives up the prices of entry level homes.\u00a0\nPeople who should be able to afford a house at 25 years old with a good job simply cannot afford to buy into this market. We cannot build enough units to stay ahead of the proposed growth. Money laundering is also playing a role, increasing the price of Canadian real estate by $40 billion dollars in 2018. The RCMP lack the resources to effectively fight this crime. This artificially inflates an already pressured market.\u00a0\nTo address this the People's Party is proposing to reduce immigration to between 100,000 and 150,000 people per year. We will give more support to the RCMP and Border Service Agents to crack down on money laundering and increase the speed at which current claims can be processed. This will help clear the backlog and will stop the flow of illegal border crossers into the country from the United States. This will reduce demand and lower housing costs.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nVote enthusiastically to repeal the ineffectual carbon tax. It does not reduce emissions of CO2. It does not help the environment. It just makes everything more expensive. The cost of living is increasing much faster than wages have been increasing in Canada. From housing to boxes of cereal. If you are on a fixed income, it is hard to keep up with the pace of the increasing costs.\u00a0\nA People's Party government will put an end to corporate welfare. We will impose pipelines in order to end our reliance on Saudi oil. This will boost Canadian jobs, increase transportation\u00a0safety, remove tankers transporting oil across the ocean and keep $300 million per month in our economy, not in Saudi Arabia's. This is low hanging fruit. Simple policies that any self-interested government would implement. We are using oil all across the country. We are an oil rich nation. Why are we spending $300 million per month on foreign oil?\u00a0\nKeeping the $300 million per month will help the Canadian economy. A pipeline to bring our natural resources to support our Eastern Provinces will increase skilled jobs across the country for years to come.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nOur current government has had a strong majority with a strong environmental mandate that they have largely ignored. They have heaped on the rhetoric, but they have done nothing of substance for the environment. In fact, our waterways are filthy and they are failing to institute any concrete environmental policy.\u00a0\nThe previous government had a system and timeline in place to move to end the discharge of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence and off the coast of British Columbia. The Trudeau Liberals immediately moved to allow this process in 2015, days after assuming office. A People's Party will prioritize clean water and will implement a plan to stop this practice of discharging raw sewage into our waterways.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual? \nMark Paralovos (rhymes with \"for all of us\") is the People's Party of Canada candidate for Guelph.\u00a0\nMark is a proud, first generation Canadian. He was born in Toronto and his family moved to Guelph in the mid-eighties. He has lived here ever since. He comes from a large, supportive family, is married and has two school-aged children.\u00a0\nMark is a children's mental health professional by trade and spent 15 years working in that field, both in private facilities and with various school boards. During that time he was actively involved in union negotiations and served as a Union Steward.\u00a0\nIn 2016, Mark decided to take his career in a completely different direction, working with businesses to develop and manage their websites. He currently works with a small firm managing the e-commerce and advertising aspects of the business.\u00a0\nMark writes and produces a daily YouTube podcast focused on Canadian federal politics (https://CanadaPoli.com). After being nominated as the People's Party Candidate for Guelph, Mark started a second podcast specific to Guelph and his campaign (https://markparalovos.com). He also sits on the French as a Second Language Advisory Committee (FSLAC) with the Upper Grand District School Board.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe top issue is people, homeless people, people wanting to buy a house, drug-addicted people, seniors needing care, hospital bed space and abuse of minorities.\u00a0Each of these requires a unique approach. Some just need money, others need counseling, some need care and all benefit from having a stronger image.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI know of a family of five in Hong Kong who lived in a 600 sq. ft. apartment for years.\u00a0We\u00a0can make smaller housing units available to address the high cost of living.\u00a0 We need not be using more than we need.\u00a0The CHP endorses the Fair Tax Policy of collecting federal money through a sales tax and abolishing income tax.\u00a0People would only be taxed on their spending, and not on their savings.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOne major concern is for carbon in the atmosphere.\u00a0New technologies can capture carbon from the air and turn it to other uses.\u00a0While costly now, we can invest in these technologies. Two such organizations remove as much carbon from the air as is produced by 600,000 cars.\u00a0More businesses like this can help. Driving at 100 km/h on freeways, instead of 120 km/h, saves 30 per cent\u00a0of fuel. Less fuel means less carbon in the air.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am caring, sympathetic and hard working.\u00a0I am a good supporter of the needs of others.\u00a0I played a role in the founding of Michael House in Guelph, a crisis pregnancy home.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\n(Actually) affordable housing. People are finding it incredibly difficult to find adequate housing to rent (never mind buy).\nWe believe housing is a right. Our platform includes building one million new units of social housing, but also policies around better jobs. Guelph has a low rate of unemployment, but we don't know how many are underemployed or in other forms of precarious employment. Our full employment strategy, which includes a 32 hour work week with no loss in pay (and a $20 minimum wage), and job creation plans \u2014 housing, an affordable electric car and mass transit, retrofits and upgrades, etc. would make it a bit easier to afford.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nNationalize. Take away corporations' demand for profit over all other considerations. If we nationalized GM, for example, we could build an affordable electric car and mass public transit.\nOur energy and resource extraction policies could be based on what we need rather than what brings (a few people and corporations) more profit. Our full employment strategy, job creation, free daycare and post-secondary education, expanded Medicare and public services are also aimed at addressing these concerns.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nStop increasing the military budgets! We would cut them by 75 per cent. The military industrial complex is responsible for much\u00a0of our carbon emissions and fossil fuel use.\nWe can't keep supporting environmentally (and socially!) unsustainable practices, and the money could be used to fund the services, the infrastructure, etc. that are good for the people, and good for the planet. We would close the tarsands and the associated pipelines, end carbon 'credits,'\u00a0and develop solar, wind, geothermal, hydro and other renewables.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a mom, an activist, an anti-fascist (which should be a basic stance as a decent person), a feminist, a book addict (reader, collector, and supporter of writers). I don't think I have a good poker face when it comes to politics.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe lack of funding for social services and affordable housing. Reduce the military budget by 5 billion dollars over 5 years, halt buying 88 advanced fighter aircraft costing $15 to 17 billion\u00a0and pump these funds into social services and affordable housing across the country.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nGo after the off shore tax shelters and tax muilti-national companies and upper 0.1 per cent\u00a0of wealthy public at 70 per cent\u00a0of income. Use funds to establish a guaranteed annual income for all Canadians.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nNationalize the fossil fuel industry and place under a crown corporation much like the National Energy Programme of the mid 1970's set up under Pierre Trudeau. Stop all subsidies to fossil fuel companies and place yearly levy of 20 per cent\u00a0on all \u00a0fossil fuel stocks traded\u00a0on the stock exchange. This levy will\u00a0increase\u00a0by additional 20 per cent\u00a0every year over five\u00a0years when 100% levy will be reached to end\u00a0the investments by banks financial institutions\u00a0in fossil fuel industry.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am an international\u00a0socialist who envisions\u00a0a World Federation of Socialist States (WFSS) as the only real alternative to the ongoing\u00a0the destruction that national and\u00a0 trans-national capitalism has brought this planet\u00a0 and more specifically, saving\u00a0this planet from fossil fuel capitalism, the threat of nuclear war and runaway militarism.\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo was unable to find any contact information for Michael Wassilyn.

She has a two-year-old son and is pregnant. She regularly picks up needles and throws them away.\u00a0\n\"Within a block, I encounter multiple needles. People passed out on the street, sometimes beside our home in the driveway. Passing that with my infant son and another on the way, is not a very good feeling. Trying to make change and offer these people whatever support I can as an individual, but having my child grow up to see that's what is normal where we live, is heartbreaking.\n\"I'm seeing a lot more frustration and a lot more people saying there's nothing we can do and there's still a few of us hanging on saying we're going to find a solution, we're going to find ways to help and this isn't how it's going to stay.\"\nThis man has\u00a0used drugs for 10 years.\n\"I usually collect cans or bottles. I find a lot of stuff that people throw away, you can reuse tons of it. So I pick a lot of it up and sell it and then that just goes ahead and feeds my habit.

I think people are becoming tired and angry about it. It's gotten to the point that there's concern and people feel sorry for the people who don't have places to stay, but it's gotten to the point that it's affecting the people who live in the neighbourhood.\nThis man has not used drugs\u00a0for four years. He works part time now, and occasionally takes in people who are struggling in OEV.\u00a0\n\"There's a stigma down here. There's lots and lots of dirty users, and that's how any intravenous drug users get a bad name for these people who leave their needles and stuff laying around. The solution is to get these people a home, stableness, somebody who cares about them, because their family has left them because they became an addict, and that's the God's honest truth. There's no other solution. But you get them happy and out of their low, we won't have this problem.\"\n\"They're asking for help in the wrong ways, by leaving dirty rigs around.

There's lot of needles down here. What I think it is, is people are OD'ing so quickly on it, because they don't know what they're getting and there's other carfentanil and stuff.\n\"There is a housing problem in London.

One call is from parents begging to see their children's faces since court-ordered, in-person visits have been delayed indefinitely. Another is from a mother who needs to take parenting classes as part of a plan to reunite with her family.

Some regions have ended face-to-face meetings. Others have brought in screening tools for workers entering homes. Only a few have dedicated funds to support children in government care during the pandemic.\nBritish Columbia has temporarily suspended in-person visits between children and youth in care and their families. There are a few exceptions such as one to ensure mothers can breastfeed their infants.\nOntario has announced $40 million for infection control and personal protective equipment in residential facilities, including those for youth and children in care. It's recommended that only essential visitors enter. An emailed statement says the province is encouraging the use of technology to keep kids and parents in contact.\nThe province has also brought in a moratorium on youth aging out of care so they won't lose financial support or housing during the pandemic. The Child Welfare League of Canada has recommended the same move for every region of the country.\nAlberta is encouraging case workers to conduct family meetings by phone or video chat. It's part of the province's \"evolving policies,\" Lauren Armstrong in the Children's Services Ministry office said in an email. In-person visits can still happen, but only for urgent situations.\n\"We know that vulnerable children may be more at-risk without the routine of going to school and attending social functions, so Children's Services remains ready to follow up on concerns and work with families,\" she wrote.\nSaskatchewan is reviewing policies as public health recommendations change and is preparing to provide social workers with personal protective equipment. Janice Colquhoun, executive director of child and family programs, says it's vitally important there is still the ability to respond to reports of child abuse or neglect.\nManitoba is allowing workers to weigh what's in the best interest of a child against any potential public health risk. An email from the province's Family Services Department said social workers entering homes to make sure kids are safe and family visits are considered essential.\nDaphne Penrose, Manitoba's advocate for children and youth, says provinces should allow flexibility because each family and situation is unique.\n\"To say no visits, period, may not be appropriate in every situation,\" she says. \"Workers may be able to really provide visitations under the protocols that are required.\"\nWith a rapidly evolving situation there may be a need for more stringent measures, Penrose says, but each decision must respect a child's rights, including family visits, education and feeling safe.\nEvery province, agency and family needs to make plans for how to deal with any new public safety measures that could last for months, Penrose suggests. In Manitoba, she says those conversations are well underway.\n\"When we have severely addicted kids, children and youth, who are unable to make safe and healthy decisions for themselves just on the day to day, when you add this level of pandemic, they become even more vulnerable than they were before.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1555456067808", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "'The challenge is real': Syncrude commits to bolstering Fort McMurray economy", "description": "Syncrude's managing director says the community is facing low oil prices, closing businesses", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-syncrude-oil-economy-1.5281891", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4859118.1548010977!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/calgary-6155-syncrude-oil-gas-downtown-office-economy-economics.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2019 8:24 PM MT", "2019-09-13T02:24:34.070Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A top executive with Syncrude painted a grim image of Fort McMurray's\u00a0current economic state\u00a0at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon Thursday, but said the company is committed to helping the community gain new residents.\nDoreen Cole, managing director of Syncrude, gave a keynote speech saying Fort McMurray's boom days are over, but the company is going to continue to work with the municipality to attract new residents and support local businesses.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe company has \"not been immune\" to the hard times, and\u00a0that was compounded by a series of \"major liability events\" from 2015 to 2018 that have harmed workers and damaged equipment, she said.\n\"The recovery process certainly took its toll,\" said Cole.\nCole added that she's noticed businesses closing in the community, and noted she tried to go to\u00a0Wood Buffalo Brewing Company recently only to find that it shut down.\u00a0\n\"It seems that now, more than ever, our community seems to be surrounded by uncertainty,\" said Cole.\u00a0\nHousing prices are down and hotel occupancy rates are barely above 40 per cent, she said.\n\"The challenge is real.\"\nBut Cole said she is optimistic, because\u00a0the company has worked with the municipality in the past to build the community and get through hard times.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of her goals is to remain reliable and get the company's costs under control, \"so we can be both regionally and globally competitive in the oil business,\" she said.\nThe company is facing challenges like growing business costs, added regulatory burdens and an \"uncertain public policy environment.\"\nFor example, she said it's taking longer to get projects,\u00a0such as\u00a0the Mildred Lake extension, approved.\u00a0The approval process for the project took seven and a half years, and Syncrude is still finishing some of the details.\u00a0\nCole emphasized that the project would only sustain the company's oil\u00a0production, not grow it, and there are no new impacts or tailings facilities associated with the work. She said that project will extend the mine's life by 15 years.\u00a0\nCole said\u00a0that they're working on making Fort McMurray a more enticing place for workers to live. This year they've hired about 200 people, with the majority being Fort McMurray residents.\u00a0\nSyncrude is putting resources into training women to work on site, encouraging employees to use the community's facilities like the pool and movie theatre, and working with local businesses to create incentive programs for employees, Cole said.\u00a0\nMayor Don Scott said he was encouraged by Cole's speech and said he would like to see more oil companies make similar commitments to Fort McMurray.\u00a0\n\"I want the other companies to be coming to the Chamber of Commerce and giving the same kind of speech, committing to the region like Syncrude did today.

Gen. Julie Payette opened a new session of Parliament Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut her 28-minute speech\u00a0\u2014 written by the Prime Minister's Office and addressed to members of parliament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0had little to say about the North.\u00a0\nThe speech\u00a0that explains the new Liberal government's mandate\u00a0did, however, focus on issues that matter to northerners, like climate change and reconciliation.\n\"Canada's children and grandchildren will judge this generation by its action \u2014 or inaction \u2014 on the defining challenge of the time: climate change,\" Payette said.\u00a0\n\"The government will continue to protect the environment and preserve Canada's natural legacy. And it will do so in a way that grows the economy and makes life more affordable.\"\nThe throne speech highlighted a need to make renewable energy more affordable, but it also promised to follow through with carbon pricing across Canada.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn response to the speech, Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq says Nunavut is working to adapt to climate change. In a recent meeting with the prime minister, Savikataaq told Justin Trudeau that Nunavut needs help with energy efficient infrastructure.\u00a0\nBecause Nunavut runs on diesel for electricity, Savikataaq said a carbon tax is just another financial drain for the territory. What Nunavut needs is more help adapting to the changes it faces in the North because of climate change, he said.\u00a0\n\"We don't have any alternative energy source and until we do, there's nothing we can do to encourage people to go to a different alternative energy source,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We want to do our share and we are, by re-insulating and getting more energy efficient diesel generators, but in the big picture what we contribute in greenhouse gas in Nunavut is very miniscule.\"\u00a0\nThe throne speech was heavy in its references to Indigenous Canadians, whose contribution as citizens Payette called \"Indigenous genius.\"\n\"Reconciliation will remain a core priority for this government,\" Payette said.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe government promised to follow through with the recommendations by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\u00a0\nThe speech said the government will work to co-create legislation with Indigenous Canadians this year to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. That declaration speaks of land, language rights and equality.\nInuit Tapiriit Kanatami\u00a0(ITK)\u00a0President Natan Obed told CBC that this timeline is ambitious, but says it's\u00a0what Inuit want.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe national Inuit organization says it is looking forward to crafting legislation with the federal government for better health care and mental health support for Inuit regions, that is consistent with what all Canadians expect.\u00a0\n\"Securing investments in infrastructure and housing remain a high priority in Inuit Nunangat,\" ITK said in a statement. \"ITK looks forward to working with ministers of the Crown to build on the progress made during the last mandate.\"\nIt's been about a\u00a0month-and-a-half since a Liberal minority government was elected, but no parliamentary business takes place until this speech from the throne is delivered in the senate.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause Canada has a minority government, an election could be called whenever a motion of non-confidence is brought through. The throne speech itself must be voted on by members of the House of Commons.

One call is from parents begging to see their children's faces since court-ordered, in-person visits have been delayed indefinitely. Another is from a mother who needs to take parenting classes as part of a plan to reunite with her family. The classes have been discontinued.\nAnother mother is looking for food so her children won't be taken into care. Funds are usually tight, but now any options for work have disappeared and prices at nearby corner stores have increased as supplies diminish.\nThere are about 10,000 children in care in Manitoba. About 90 per cent are Indigenous.\nMorgan says there are also calls from social workers, agencies and parents worried about the potential spread of the novel coronavirus when workers are entering homes. Some have been told to continue as usual despite the world around them shutting down.\nChild welfare is an essential service, Morgan says, but it is not being dealt with like others during this unprecedented time.\n\"There isn't consistency among agencies in the way that they are responding to COVID-19,\" Morgan says.\nPlans for children in care in the face of longer-term restrictions due to COVID-19 vary across the country. Some regions have ended face-to-face meetings. Others have brought in screening tools for workers entering homes. Only a few have dedicated funds to support children in government care during the pandemic.\nBritish Columbia has temporarily suspended in-person visits between children and youth in care and their families. There are a few exceptions such as one to ensure mothers can breastfeed their infants.\nOntario has announced $40 million for infection control and personal protective equipment in residential facilities, including those for youth and children in care. It's recommended that only essential visitors enter. An emailed statement says the province is encouraging the use of technology to keep kids and parents in contact.\nThe province has also brought in a moratorium on youth aging out of care so they won't lose financial support or housing during the pandemic. The Child Welfare League of Canada has recommended the same move for every region of the country.\nAlberta is encouraging case workers to conduct family meetings by phone or video chat. It's part of the province's \"evolving policies,\" Lauren Armstrong in the Children's Services Ministry office said in an email. In-person visits can still happen, but only for urgent situations.\n\"We know that vulnerable children may be more at-risk without the routine of going to school and attending social functions, so Children's Services remains ready to follow up on concerns and work with families,\" she wrote.\nSaskatchewan is reviewing policies as public health recommendations change and is preparing to provide social workers with personal protective equipment. Janice Colquhoun, executive director of child and family programs, says it's vitally important there is still the ability to respond to reports of child abuse or neglect.\nManitoba is allowing workers to weigh what's in the best interest of a child against any potential public health risk. An email from the province's Family Services Department said social workers entering homes to make sure kids are safe and family visits are considered essential.\nDaphne Penrose, Manitoba's advocate for children and youth, says provinces should allow flexibility because each family and situation is unique.\n\"To say no visits, period, may not be appropriate in every situation,\" she says. \"Workers may be able to really provide visitations under the protocols that are required.\"\nWith a rapidly evolving situation there may be a need for more stringent measures, Penrose says, but each decision must respect a child's rights, including family visits, education and feeling safe.\nEvery province, agency and family needs to make plans for how to deal with any new public safety measures that could last for months, Penrose suggests. In Manitoba, she says those conversations are well underway.\n\"When we have severely addicted kids, children and youth, who are unable to make safe and healthy decisions for themselves just on the day to day, when you add this level of pandemic, they become even more vulnerable than they were before.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "People with severe disabilities feel 'duped' by Alberta government, AISH recipient says", "description": "'It concerns me because the vulnerable community can become more vulnerable'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/aish-alberta-jason-kenney-1.5346856", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5346863.1572885067!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ian-young-disability-advocate-edmonton.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 04, 2019 10:28 AM MT", "2019-11-04T17:28:15.436Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Ian Young feels betrayed by cost-saving measures\u00a0in the Alberta budget that will shrink the benefits for people with severe disabilities.\nRecipients who rely on Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) feel deceived, Young said.\u00a0\n\"During the campaign Mr. Kenney seemed very passionate about not decreasing AISH which has turned out to be a total broken promise.

And then they go and take money away from the most vulnerable,\" Young said.\n\"There is a saying in the disability community, nothing about us without us. Not one person, agency or AISH recipient was consulted on this.\"\u00a0\nThe government says its\u00a0plan to de-index AISH payments would reduce program costs by $10 million in 2019-20.\nTrevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary, has said that for individual AISH recipients, the\u00a0move would reduce the purchasing power of monthly benefits (depending on the rate of inflation) by roughly $35 next year,\u00a0$65 the year after, $100 the year after that, and so on until indexing resumes.\nDuring his campaign for the leadership of the United Conservative Party, Jason Kenney said that his government would not cut the program.\nIn one instance, he accused the NDP government of fearmongering about his intention to slash the program.\n\"This is complete rubbish,\" Kenney said in a Facebook live event\u00a0during the election campaign.\u00a0 \"The truth is, we actually voted in favour of legislation brought by the NDP government last fall to increase AISH benefits.\u00a0\n\"But the minister ... is trying to scare people, including those with intellectual disabilities, into saying that their basic income is going to be slashed or eliminated.

(Jagmeet Singh is mostly just ignored).\nIdeas, if there are any, seem submerged in the green bile. I don't know the fellow with the big sign in Manotick, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's one of those wags who calls the prime minister \"Turdeau,\" a witticism you often see in the open sewer of readers' comments on news websites.\nTo the Manotick fellow, no doubt, the fact that we appear to be headed into a recession, hoping central banks protect us as trade wars play hell with our economies and threaten our personal finances, facing the catastrophic costs of climate change not down the road sometime, but right now, or at least when the rivers begin to rise again next spring, is all secondary to just getting rid of Trudeau, because, you know, Trudeau sucks.\nThat's not to say there aren't people of goodwill who find Trudeau disappointing. There are. I'm one of them. I do not see a coherent fiscal vision in his government, other than unfocused spending. I do not hear any plan for sheltering Canadians from the next global financial crisis, which is coming for all of us as surely as arthritis is stalking the boomers.\u00a0\nHis piddling, refundable carbon tax is not changing energy consumption habits. It merely signals that as a long-term goal. I hear nothing about floodproofing Canadian homes and entire Canadian communities, which must be done and which will cost unimaginable amounts and will require national leadership.\nAnd apart from the NDP, (I am discounting the Liberal's proposal for first-time homeowners as nothing but a few drops), I hear no serious talk about whether government can intervene to help an entire generation for whom housing seems out of reach for life. (Spare me warnings of socialism; all three big federal parties, including supposedly free market Conservatives, favour the price-fixing that allows farmers to sell dairy and poultry at inflated prices, among other programs).\nLiberals ask voters to 'choose forward' while Tories vow to help Canadians 'get ahead' in new campaign ads\nInstead we have Trudeau's treacly platitudes, coordinated with his Stepford-wives ministers. They grate; either he and his team are incapable of giving straight answers, or don't think voters need them.\nI'm inclined to believe the latter, judging by the now-deleted tweet his environment minister, Catherine McKenna, sent out last spring, after a festive evening in a Newfoundland bar. The tweet contained a video of a smiling McKenna explaining that\u00a0\"if you actually say it louder, we've learned in the House of Commons, if you repeat it, if you say it louder, if that is your talking point, people will totally believe it!\"\nAnd what are the Liberals' election talking points, in this age of environmental insecurity and economic anxiety?\u00a0\nThat Andrew Scheer is scary.\nHe's scary because he does not support a woman's right to abortion, and because he seems to harbour some sort of animus toward gay and transgender people.\nPerhaps he does; it would be helpful to know if he still considers, as he declared in 2005, that gays are unfit for marriage because they cannot \"naturally\" have children (neither can lots of heterosexuals). It's also reasonable to conclude he doesn't want to be around gays at all, given his refusal to take part in Pride parades. I suppose some Canadians still hang on to attitudes like that.\nBut scary? I don't know. Religious, certainly, with all the heavy moral compulsion that implies. Hopelessly dull, perhaps, and unprepossessing.\nLooking at his ideas, though, I don't see scary. Actually, I don't see much.\nHe recognizes climate change is a serious threat, but his plan is even more pusillanimous than Trudeau's. He will somehow change everyone's behaviour by killing the carbon tax and lowering the price on fuel. He wouldn't balance the federal budget in the next four years, either.\nTo be fair, apart from his weird attacks on the Canada Food Guide and his opposition to water, as opposed to milk, as a primary means of self-hydration, he hasn't revealed most of his election platform yet.\nBut the thrust of his campaign is clear enough: Trudeau Sucks.\nTrudeau is a hypocrite, Trudeau is a \"lawbreaker,\" Trudeau might even be a criminal. Earlier this month, at a public event in New Brunswick, Trudeau greeted Scheer, calling him \"Andrew.\" Scheer, wired for sound with his own camera rolling, pompously replied by calling Trudeau a liar.\nMuch of this rests on the SNC Lavalin affair, in which Trudeau pushed for a non-criminal settlement of charges the Quebec company faces for allegedly bribing Libyan officials. When his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, refused to go along with the prime minister's wishes, he replaced her.\nSubsequently, the federal ethics commissioner found Trudeau's intervention in the case had violated an ethics law.\nAgain: perhaps. (The ethics commissioner is not a judge, he's an official, and there are questions about his interpretation of the law.)\u00a0Also, SNC Lavalin didn't get its settlement. Trudeau's intervention was aspirational.\nMore relevant to me is whether his record of governance is so bad that he should be replaced by leader with no record at all, as Stephen Harper was.\nAll due respect to colleagues who have just written books exploring Trudeau's character and foibles, I'm more interested in the exhaustive new study of Trudeau's record by two dozen academics (of 353 promises, he came through on half, partially delivered on 40 per cent, and broke 10 per cent).\nThe \"vote for me because the other guy is scary,\" nana-nana-poo-poo stuff I just find useless. That Trudeau has family wealth and privilege, and that his previous job was teaching drama at a high school, are not serious considerations, either, any more than the fact that Scheer has lived in government housing for half of his political career and his previous job was selling insurance.\nMy friend the pollster Darrell Bricker, who seems equally unimpressed with both Trudeau and Scheer, puts the absence of policy discussion beautifully.\n\"In an era of hot cognition, of tribalism, with dog whistles everywhere, good public policy on the Acropolis has become about as relevant as the Acropolis itself.\"\nI wish I'd said that.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Poor market conditions and log shortages due to outside forces such as\u00a0the mountain pine beetle and wildfires\u00a0are causing mills to shutter, leaving towns that are dependent on the lumber industry scrambling to adapt\u00a0and search\u00a0for new ways to diversify their economies.\nTolko employee Jennifer Johnson said she was in shock when she learned last month the sawmill she works at in Quesnel will close this summer.\n\"It's definitely going to be a struggle because there's not a great deal of jobs that have around the same pay or benefits,\" she said.\nJohnson\u00a0and her family had been planning to buy a house, but that's now on hold.\u00a0\nThe last day of work will be tough for her and the rest of the staff. \"There's probably going to be some tears shed I'm sure,\" she said.\nJohnson's story is common across B.C.\nDoug Donaldson, B.C.'s minister of forests, lands, natural resource operations and rural development, said he isn't surprised by the closures and drastic reductions in operations.\u00a0\n\"These curtailments and shutdowns were the result of natural and global forces,\u00a0and they didn't happen overnight,\u00a0and that's what's so frustrating,\" Donaldson told\u00a0Daybreak North\u00a0host Carolina de Ryk.\u00a0\nA weak U.S. housing market and low harvest levels because of\u00a0mountain pine beetles, as well as wildfires and\u00a0land used for caribou protection, are some of the primary factors affecting the industry, said\u00a0Harry Nelson, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia's\u00a0faculty of forestry.\u00a0\n\"Our main market is the U.S.,\" said Nelson. \"Essentially, we've had pretty good U.S. housing markets improving over the last few years,\u00a0and they've just become much weaker this past spring.\n\"And as demand has come off [for timber], prices have as well too.\"\nAdd that\u00a0to\u00a0a low supply of timber, and the industry is struggling to get by.\nTolko's\u00a0upcoming mill closure in Quesnel\u00a0is a big\u00a0hit to the Cariboo city with a population of 12,000.\nMayor Bob Simpson said the city was\u00a0expecting it.\u00a0The\u00a0annual allowable cut for timber was\u00a0decreased about two years ago,\u00a0and Tolko had been struggling, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"That sense of surprise still settles in because you don't want to believe it's going to happen, but\u00a0as a [city] council,\u00a0we said it's going to happen,\" said Simpson, former forestry critic for the B.C. NDP, in 2009.\nCanfor\u00a0closed its mill in Quesnel\u00a0in 2014, and other mills had experienced closures and reductions in operation\u00a0prior to that, so council began planning for this transition five years ago.\n\"We've been here before and we have a transition team\u00a0in\u00a0place based on the lessons learned from that,\" Simpson\u00a0said.\nIn its last term, city council implemented\u00a0a three-year tax freeze\u00a0on the industry at 2014 levels\u00a0to try to make\u00a0the city\u00a0less dependent on it,\u00a0said Simpson.\u00a0\n\"If we hadn't done that, then the impact of a Tolko closure would have been much more catastrophic than it's going to be. It will be around a $400,000 loss to the city when they fully decommission the mill.\"\nThe city is trying to diversify its economy by growing its agriculture and tourism sectors, but the mayor still considers Quesnel a forestry town.\nWith West Fraser's large sawmill, two pulp mills, and medium density fibreboard operation, as well as the C and C Wood Products\u00a0operations, Simpson believes there is enough variety in forest manufacturing for it to remain a foundation of the city's economy.\u00a0\n\"We have the luxury \u2014 and it's the fundamental difference between ourselves and say the Clearwaters, or even 100 Mile Houses \u2014 we have the most concentrated diverse manufacturing in the forest sector all in our community,\" said Simpson.\nIn May, the province passed a bill to amend the\u00a0Forest Act, which gives it\u00a0the right to review forest tenure transfers between companies.\nTenure swaps now have to pass the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations's\u00a0public interest test. It also creates the opportunity for more tenure to go to First Nations and communities, said Donaldson.\nIn the short term, the province is trying to help workers who have lost their jobs by connecting them with Service\u00a0Canada, Work B.C.\u00a0and retraining opportunities, he said.\n\"But we also want to see the mills get up and running again.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Antique items from historic St. George house up for sale", "description": "Candelabras, bookcases, china sets and silverware among the possessions go on sale", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/antique-items-historic-mansion-sale-1.5228619", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5012504.1564411028!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gillmor-house.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 29, 2019 4:35 PM AT", "2019-07-29T20:59:17.313Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A historic, two-storey house is up for sale in St. George, along with its collection of antique items.\u00a0\nGillmor House was built in 1846 by Arthur Hill Gillmor, a businessman, politician and opponent of Confederation who became a Canadian senator.\nNow, after housing six generations of the family, the estate is up for sale for the first time.\nSara Sparks, a descendent of Gillmor, is organizing the sale.\u00a0\n\"When you have a house of this size with the amount of stuff that's in it, should someone buy it, you cannot clear it at the drop of a hat,\" Sparks said in an interview with Information Morning Saint John.\n\"And there are so many collectibles, curios, beautiful old furniture beds.

They bought a house and had two children, now seven and two years old, and she started a part-time photography business.\nIn July, owner Canfor Corp. announced the mill where she worked as a weigh-scale operator would close again. Because it's an \"indefinite curtailment,\" Dumoulin said, there was no severance paid.\nMeanwhile, her husband, a contract log truck driver, lost his job delivering to the nearby Conifex Timber Inc. sawmill during a five-week curtailment blamed on high log costs and difficult market conditions.\nThe good news is the Conifex shutdown ended, she said.\n\"There's that saying, 'You do me wrong once, shame on you; do me wrong twice, shame on me,\"' Dumoulin said in an interview.\n\"I'm not letting that happen a third time. I need to get out of this industry.\"\nThis year's mill closures and production curtailments in British Columbia have\u00a0affected more than 5,900 workers at 25 mills in 22 communities, according to provincial estimates.\nObservers say the frustrating part is that little can be done to fix the problem.\nDestruction caused by wildfires and a severe mountain pine beetle infestation \u2014 both linked to global warming \u2014 have created acute shortages of wood fibre in B.C. that will take decades to replace.\nMeanwhile, a slowdown in U.S. housing markets means prices are depressed but the province says stumpage fees for Crown timber \u2014 adjusted quarterly \u2014 can't be reduced arbitrarily for fear of weakening Canada's legal fight against softwood lumber duties imposed by the U.S.\nMarty Gibbons, president of the United Steelworkers union local in Kamloops, B.C., estimates more than 400 of his members have lost jobs thanks to the closures of sawmills in Clearwater and Clinton, B.C.\nBut the longtime forestry worker says there's no comparison with previous industry slowdowns in 2008 and 2015.\n\"This isn't a slowdown, this is a capacity reduction,\" he said. \"These are not temporary layoffs, this is a correction in the industry ... we just don't have enough timber to supply the mills.\"\nAnalysts expect the industry will see a lot more bad news before there's much good news.\nResearchers at FEA Canada estimate there will be 53 to 55 sawmills left in the B.C. Interior by 2028, down from about 95 mills in 2007, in a report based mainly on provincial timber supply estimates.\n\"It takes 80 years to grow a tree. So, looking out 50 to 60 years, it looks pretty good,\" said Russ Taylor, managing director of FEA Canada.\n\"But in the interim it's going to stay relatively flat, for the next two or three, maybe four decades.\"\nThe lack of wood fibre is expected to spill over into closures in the oriented strandboard panel sector, where two mills were closed this year, and will eventually hit the pulp and paper industry as well, said Kevin Mason, managing director of ERA Forest Products Research.\nClosures through the end of the year are expected to cumulatively remove about two billion board feet per year of capacity, from recent annual output of between 10 billion and 11 billion board feet, he said.\n\"These are difficult transitions and not a day goes by that I am not thinking about the workers and communities who are being affected by these closures and curtailments,\" said B.C. Forests Minister Doug Donaldson in an emailed statement.\nHe said he is working to ensure support systems are in place for forestry workers, including job fairs, skills training and career counselling, support for families and economic diversification strategies.\nHe offered a similar message in Mackenzie in mid-August, speaking at a rally organized by a new organization founded by three local women called Mackenzie Matters.\nKim Guthrie, a 57-year-old notary public who chairs the group, said she fears for the future of the community she and her husband moved to about 30 years ago.\n\"We don't want to leave. We want to stay here,\" she said.\n\"This is our home and where our friends are. We know everybody. It's a really tight, close-knit community.\"\n"}, {"author": "Eva Voinigescu ", "title": "Why Canadians find saving so hard \u2014 and how to get better at it ASAP", "description": "A new study says we\u2019re particularly bad at saving, so we enlisted an expert for help", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/work-money/why-canadians-find-saving-so-hard-and-how-to-get-better-at-it-asap-1.5172868", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5172871.1560370812!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/savings.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 12, 2019 4:33 PM ET", "2019-06-12T20:33:48.375Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "According to a new analysis of numbers from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from personal finance comparison website Finder.com, Canadians are forecast to save just 3.21 per cent of their disposable income in 2020, or about $1,277 on average per household. This places us in the bottom half of OECD member countries, behind Ireland, Slovenia and the United States, where Americans are predicted to save more than triple that amount.\n\"Canadians are currently spending more of their income to service their debts than Americans, which partly explains the lower savings rate,\" says Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. But our money isn't just going toward our debt.\n\"Savings is taking a hit because the cost of living is going up,\" says certified financial planner Shannon Lee Simmons.\nIn the more than ten years that Simmons has been advising clients on their finances, she's seen the amount of money Canadians are able to put away every month decrease for a number of reasons including stagnating wages and the rising price of necessities like gas, groceries, daycare and housing.\nSimmons says housing used to account for around 30 to 35 per cent of people's take-home pay and even less for renters. Now, because wages aren't keeping pace with housing costs, that amount has grown to 45 or 50 per cent for some households.\nKeeping up with the @Joneses\n\"We also have this really intense pressure to spend that I just didn't see five-plus years ago,\" Simmons adds. \"And then we don't tend to say no to those things that we can't afford.\"\nSimmons says this is partially driven by changing expectations of what daily life is supposed to cost and what we're supposed to provide for our families. For example, she cites the increasing popularity of home renovations and the plethora of children's extracurricular activities available today.\n\"Social media has a lot to do with it. We look at how other people are living that are in our same peer group, and we think, 'Well, maybe I should be doing that, too, because I don't want to fall behind.'\"\nThe result of this spending is visible in Canada's household debt to income ratio which, according to Finder.com, has been rising since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe majority of Canadians aged 20 and over admit to making money mistakes, whether it's overspending on lifestyle or making a bad investment. But Simmons says that not being able to save the benchmark 10 per cent of your pre-tax income doesn't mean you're a financial failure.\nSomething is still better than nothing\nSimmons doesn't promote a set amount her clients should be saving because it implies that anything less is not worth striving for. \"I would rather someone save a little bit than just give up altogether because they feel like the goal is too unrealistic.\"\nInstead, she says, you should use that benchmark as a catalyst to examine why you're not reaching your savings goals and make changes accordingly.\nSimmons says the first thing to do is to figure out what you can and can't afford to save by mapping out your money.\nOne tool that can help people who are struggling to figure out how much they can afford to save is Thrive Savings, a Canadian app that connects to your bank account and uses artificial intelligence to evaluate your bills and spending habits, determine what you're able to save, and automatically put that money toward pre-set goals like a vacation or emergency fund.\nAccording to Thrive founder and CEO Jordan Wimmer, 65 per cent of Thrive's users identify as working part-time, freelance or on demand \u2014 a community that's not always able to take advantage of typical automatic savings plans.\nWimmer says that \"even at small amounts, Thrive shows users that, yes, they can actually save money, which in turn further empowers the user to save even more.\" She says 50 per cent of Thrive users ask to increase their savings rates after one month of using the service and save $80 per month on average.\nHoning your financial focus\nOnce you've figured out what you are able to save, Simmons encourages prioritizing based on where you'll get the biggest bang for your buck. For example, if you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down first. Then you can start to look at building an emergency savings account, saving for a house or putting some money away for retirement.\nOther apps that can help you save with minimal effort include Money Box, which, like Thrive, allows you to set savings goals, make contributions and track your progress. If you want to invest the money you're saving, Mylo and Wealthsimple have apps that connect to your debit and credit cards to round up your purchases and put that money into an investment account.\nSimmons recommends having two chequing accounts: one for fixed expenses like rent, phone and car payments, and a second for discretionary spending. If you only spend money from your discretionary account, you don't have to worry about budgeting, she says. She suggests using a banking app to check in on your balance regularly to stay aware of where you're at. Experts also agree that comparison shopping when opening a bank account or getting a credit card can help you save on fees and interest rates.\nLastly, Simmons recommends seeking unbiased and individualized financial advice from someone who isn't trying to sell you insurance or investment products. This can help you sort out your financial goals and priorities, and provide you with strategies that fit your specific needs.\n\"Life is long, and there are periods of time where you're able to save and there are periods of time where sometimes just breaking even is the goal,\" says Simmons. Whether it's starting a business or paying for daycare, its normal to experience ebbs and flows in savings patterns. \"The problem is when you're never in one of the upticks.\"\nEva Voinigescu is a freelance journalist and producer.

Expect the pace to pick up again\u00a0now that the federal election campaign is over, eliminating the risk of causing controversies that could hurt their Conservative cousins.\nSince the PCs adjourned in the legislature in early June,\u00a0Ford has altered the face of his government. He made a significant cabinet shuffle, and his controversial chief of staff Dean French resigned amid accusations of nepotism.\nHere's what the Ford government is expected to do in the coming weeks and months:\u00a0\nThe biggest challenge facing the Ford government this fall will be getting contract deals with the three big teachers'\u00a0unions without a strike. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) are in\u00a0the midst of taking strike votes and their contract talks have bogged down. The Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) is also preparing to take a strike vote that would conclude by mid-November.\nThe biggest sticking point in negotiations so far involves high school class sizes. While the government had set out a four-year plan to increase the average class size to 28 (from 22 last year), Education Minister Stephen\u00a0Lecce\u00a0revealed last week that he's now proposing an average class size of 25. OSSTF president Harvey Bischof\u00a0says the move would still result in the elimination of some 5,000 teaching jobs. The province wants annual wage increases capped at one\u00a0per cent, while the union\u00a0wants an increase in line with inflation.\u00a0\u00a0\nMovement on the Ford government's promise to allow corner stores to sell beer pretty much ground to a halt in recent months.\u00a0 That's in large part because the province is struggling to negotiate its way out of a contract that would potentially see taxpayers pay\u00a0the Beer Store conglomerate hundreds of millions\u00a0of dollars in\u00a0compensation for the big increase in retail competition.\nThe government tabled a bill in late May to\u00a0terminate the Beer Store contract but Government House Leader Paul Calandra\u00a0now says getting it passed into law is not one of his priorities.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Ontario winemakers are also pushing for a more liberalized sales regime. And the big supermarket chains are keen to get a piece of the lucrative booze distribution market. In this multi-billion-dollar industry, there's plenty at stake, even if you don't drink.\u00a0\nNew Finance Minister Rod Phillips will deliver his first \"mini-budget\" on Nov. 6\u00a0when he tables the fall economic statement in the legislature. Last year's fall statement contained the controversial moves to scrap the province's French-language services commissioner, environmental commissioner\u00a0and the children and youth advocate.\u00a0\nThe statement will include a new, more accurate deficit figure for the 2019-20 fiscal year, as the shortfall\u00a0projected back in April in then-minister Vic Fedeli's budget\u00a0was $10.7 billion. Expect Phillips to revise the 2019-20 number downward by several billion dollars.\nThat's because the true deficit figure for 2018-19 was revealed last month to be $7.4 billion (nowhere near the $15 billion that Ford's team repeatedly insisted it was). A deficit-cutting government does not want its shortfall to grow year-over-year.\u00a0\nThe government is poised to announce the creation of its first wave of Ontario Health Teams: joining hospitals, long-term care providers and home care agencies in organizations that will receive a single pool of funding from the province, with an aim of spending health-care dollars as efficiently as possible.\nIt's part of the government's plan for tackling the problem of hallway medicine\u00a0by relieving the pressure on hospitals.\nWatch for the hallway medicine statistics as flu season arrives: evidence so far shows the government has made next to no progress on reducing the extent of the problem since it took office.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn front of a business-friendly audience last week, Ford revealed that his government will soon reveal a plan for what he calls \"affordable ownership\" of homes.\nHe did not offer details, telling people to \"stay tuned,\" but added, \"We're going to unleash the contractors and let them start developing.\" The government laid out a housing supply plan back in May, but Ford hinted\u00a0this new program\u00a0will involve some provincial government help to make\u00a0it easier for people to buy homes.\nOn the next-to-last-day before the legislature adjourned in June, the government introduced a bill that would cap public sector wage increases at one per cent annually for each of the next three years.\nThe cap would apply broadly to teachers, college and university staff, hospital workers and provincial government employees.\u00a0Passing this bill into law is one of the government's legislative priorities,\u00a0Calandra\u00a0told CBC News last week.\u00a0\nAfter hinting in August he'd consider dropping Ontario's court challenge of the federal carbon tax if Justin\u00a0Trudeau's Liberals won the federal election, Ford slammed the door on that less than 48 hours after the Liberals actually won the election.\nHe called the carbon price \"the worst tax you could ever face\" and vowed to continue the court battle. Ontario's top court ruled against the Ford government\u00a0in June, saying Ottawa has the constitutional right to impose the carbon price. The province is now waiting to learn if the Supreme Court will hear an\u00a0appeal.\u00a0\nMore than a year after recreational cannabis was legalized in Canada, just 24 legal retail stores are currently operating in\u00a0Ontario.\u00a0Through a lottery in August, another 42 retailers won the right to apply for a licence, but none have reached the stage in the approval process to open a store.\nThe government has insisted a shortage of legal supply of weed was the reason for the\u00a0slow expansion of stores, but far larger numbers of retail outlets are operating in other\u00a0smaller provinces. There's pressure on the government to kick the retail cannabis system into high gear, so look for changes in the coming months.\u00a0\nOne of the Ford government's biggest stumbles in its first year was the backlash it faced over changes\u00a0it made to the Ontario Autism Program. The government has hit\u00a0the reset button, with the new Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Todd Smith admitting the previous plan was a mistake.\nThe province has held lengthy consultations and convened\u00a0an expert advisory\u00a0panel to make recommendations for a revised program. Smith says he expects to receive the recommendations in the next few weeks, and will make them public.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast month was the deadline for bids to redevelop Ontario Place, the province's theme park space along\u00a0Toronto's waterfront.\nAlthough the government ruled out a casino for the space, it's open to proposals for anything from a convention centre to\u00a0sport and entertainment venues to retail shops and recreational facilities.\nTourism, Culture and Sport Minister Lisa MacLeod has been non-committal about when decisions will be made.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Eva Voinigescu ", "title": "Why Canadians find saving so hard \u2014 and how to get better at it ASAP", "description": "A new study says we\u2019re particularly bad at saving, so we enlisted an expert for help", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/life/work-money/why-canadians-find-saving-so-hard-and-how-to-get-better-at-it-asap-1.5172868", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5172871.1560370812!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/savings.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 12, 2019 4:33 PM ET", "2019-06-12T20:33:48.375Z"], "source": "CBC Life", "content": "According to a new analysis of numbers from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development from personal finance comparison website Finder.com, Canadians are forecast to save just 3.21 per cent of their disposable income in 2020, or about $1,277 on average per household.

But Simmons says that not being able to save the benchmark 10 per cent of your pre-tax income doesn't mean you're a financial failure.\nSomething is still better than nothing\nSimmons doesn't promote a set amount her clients should be saving because it implies that anything less is not worth striving for. \"I would rather someone save a little bit than just give up altogether because they feel like the goal is too unrealistic.\"\nInstead, she says, you should use that benchmark as a catalyst to examine why you're not reaching your savings goals and make changes accordingly.\nSimmons says the first thing to do is to figure out what you can and can't afford to save by mapping out your money.\nOne tool that can help people who are struggling to figure out how much they can afford to save is Thrive Savings, a Canadian app that connects to your bank account and uses artificial intelligence to evaluate your bills and spending habits, determine what you're able to save, and automatically put that money toward pre-set goals like a vacation or emergency fund.\nAccording to Thrive founder and CEO Jordan Wimmer, 65 per cent of Thrive's users identify as working part-time, freelance or on demand \u2014 a community that's not always able to take advantage of typical automatic savings plans.\nWimmer says that \"even at small amounts, Thrive shows users that, yes, they can actually save money, which in turn further empowers the user to save even more.\" She says 50 per cent of Thrive users ask to increase their savings rates after one month of using the service and save $80 per month on average.\nHoning your financial focus\nOnce you've figured out what you are able to save, Simmons encourages prioritizing based on where you'll get the biggest bang for your buck. For example, if you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down first. Then you can start to look at building an emergency savings account, saving for a house or putting some money away for retirement.\nOther apps that can help you save with minimal effort include Money Box, which, like Thrive, allows you to set savings goals, make contributions and track your progress. If you want to invest the money you're saving, Mylo and Wealthsimple have apps that connect to your debit and credit cards to round up your purchases and put that money into an investment account.\nSimmons recommends having two chequing accounts: one for fixed expenses like rent, phone and car payments, and a second for discretionary spending. If you only spend money from your discretionary account, you don't have to worry about budgeting, she says. She suggests using a banking app to check in on your balance regularly to stay aware of where you're at. Experts also agree that comparison shopping when opening a bank account or getting a credit card can help you save on fees and interest rates.\nLastly, Simmons recommends seeking unbiased and individualized financial advice from someone who isn't trying to sell you insurance or investment products. This can help you sort out your financial goals and priorities, and provide you with strategies that fit your specific needs.\n\"Life is long, and there are periods of time where you're able to save and there are periods of time where sometimes just breaking even is the goal,\" says Simmons. Whether it's starting a business or paying for daycare, its normal to experience ebbs and flows in savings patterns. \"The problem is when you're never in one of the upticks.\"\nEva Voinigescu is a freelance journalist and producer.

Our population is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a record low and our economy is growing, in large part thanks to immigration.\"\nThe mayor of Hamilton\u00a0also spoke out against the sign, saying his family\u00a0moved to Canada from the Netherlands\u00a0for \"a better future.\"\n\"Immigrants have and will continue to make our country better,\" Fred Eisenberger said on Twitter.\nOn Sunday, Pattison Outdoor Advertising, which owns the billboards, said the ads would come down in response to the criticism.\n\"It was never my or Pattison Outdoor's intention to offend, alienate or in any way insult the public by allowing this ad to run,\" president Randy Otto wrote, adding the company would review its advocacy guidelines.\nEarlier that day, the company had said that if anyone took issue with the content, they should contact the third-party group running them.\nBut now Smeenk is saying he also takes issue with the content, and that his company was meant to just be the messenger.\n\"The True North Strong & Free Advertising Corp was created as a vehicle to help third-party activists promote their views prior to the upcoming election with the intention that this would be welcomed as an innovative way to participate in our democratic process,\" wrote Smeenk.\nElections Canada requires all third-party partisan advertising to include a clearly visible tagline identifying the group behind it and indicating that group has authorized the ad. Photos of the billboards show this tagline was included.\nAccording to interim financial returns the group filed with Elections Canada, True North Strong & Free Advertising spent $59,890 on billboards to be mounted in \"select cities in Canada.\"\nIt also received $60,000 from Bassett & Walker International Inc., a company that specializes in the international trade of protein products. Messages left at Bassett & Walker have not yet been returned.\nSmeenk, chief executive of a Toronto-based mining exploration company, did not immediately respond to follow-up questions Monday.\nThe People's Party of Canada did not place the ads, but Bernier said at his national campaign launch Sunday that he agrees with the message.\nOn Monday, the Quebec MP said the decision to take the billboards down amounted to censorship.\n\"The message on the billboard is not 'controversial' for two-thirds of Canadians who agree with it, and for those who disagree but support free speech and an open discussion,\" Bernier wrote on Twitter.\n\"It's only controversial for the totalitarian leftist mob who want to censor it.\"\nJohanne Mennie, the party's executive director, said Bernier already said what he had to say in the tweets.\nBernier has said the 350,000 immigrants Canada accepts every year is too high a number.\nHis party platform says it inflates housing prices and that other political parties to use \"mass immigration\" as a tool to buy votes from immigrant communities.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1541095491906", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Joel Dryden", "title": "The day after the deal: How do Calgarians feel about funding a new arena?", "description": "Some are angry, others are optimistic \u2014 but there's no shortage of opinion", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-flames-arena-jeff-davison-evan-woolley-nhl-1.5387375", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5221162.1579028161!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/calgary-events-centre.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 06, 2019 6:09 PM MT", "2019-12-07T01:09:46.216Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The negotiations are over, the agreements are signed, the next steps are planned. The city's new arena is happening, whether Calgarians are happy about it or not.\u00a0\nThe $565-million project\u00a0\u2014 $290 million of which will be funded by taxpayers\u00a0\u2014 has sparked months of contentious debate, and even had some calling for the cancellation of the deal in favour of funding projects like the Green Line LRT.\nNow that definitive agreements have been signed, how are Calgarians feeling about their investment? That was the question posed to Friday listeners of\u00a0CBC Calgary's\u00a0Alberta@Noon.\nMike Vine, a caller from Calgary, said he thought it was irresponsible to use taxpayer money for anything but basic needs.\n\"I think if we're meeting the needs of our citizens, which is fire, police and transportation, then fine. But if we have to be cutting those things in order to maintain a balanced budget and increasing our taxes, then I don't see this as being something that's a need,\" Vine said.\u00a0\"I think it's a luxury. I think it's irresponsible.\"\nCoun. Jeff Davison, who led city negotiations on the deal, said the arena was part of a larger strategy to revitalize Calgary's downtown in order to compete to\u00a0bring big business to the city.\n\"What we are trying to achieve is\u00a0looking at how do you successfully build an events centre within an entertainment and cultural district,\" Davison said on the show. \"To my knowledge, we don't have any studies out there that tell us these districts can be or can't be successful. That's really where the execution and city-building comes in to leverage onto the facility you're trying to create.\"\nCoun. Evan Woolley, who spearheaded a move to\u00a0divert funds from the arena to the Green Line,\u00a0affordable housing and policing, told Alberta@Noon\u00a0that he didn't think the arena would serve Calgarians.\n\"I think council has made the decision, but I think everybody really needs to be honest with themselves about how much of a catalyst this will be and how much revenue we'll actually get back off of this,\" he said.\nIsaac Dumaine, who lives in the Exshaw area, said he takes the CTrain frequently. He thinks the money used for the arena could have gone toward improving local transit.\n\"I can't afford a Flames ticket. None of my friends can. We watch it at the bar,\" Dumaine said. \"I think there's more things downtown worth seeing than a Flames game.\"\nWoolley said that though there's \"no doubt\" Calgary needs a new arena,\u00a0he still has questions.\n\"How much are you willing to spend and what is the value in that return that you get? I think those are the tough questions that I think I've been asking and I think that Calgarians are right to ask,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're layering that against all of the other priorities that we have.\"\nOf course, visualizing the future events centre based on a few renderings can be difficult. For that reason, there's value in taking a look north, to Edmonton's Ice District.\nRogers Place was approved in 2013, priced at\u00a0$613 million. The\u00a0Katz Group of Companies\u00a0\u2014 the ownership group behind the Edmonton Oilers \u2014\u00a0contributed 27 per cent of that project.\nArif Khan, an Edmonton resident, said residents \"got taken\" in the\u00a0arena deal.\n\"These are billionaires. They have the money, they have the resources,\" Khan said. \"They take advantage of poor taxpayers.\"\nIan Thomson, who lives in Leduc, also called the Rogers Place arena \"a bad deal,\" saying downtown costs have gone through the roof.\n\"I think it was a massive mistake,\" Thomson said. \"It's driven the costs downtown sky-high. Somebody is saying, 'Well, look at the downtown coming alive.'\n\"But you can barely afford to park your car down there.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSome say\u00a0the arena has helped spur growth in Edmonton's downtown. The amount of \"underdeveloped\" land in downtown shrunk to 40 per cent in 2016 \u2014 down from 52 per cent before the arena deal was signed \u2014 according to Edmonton's\u00a0Downtown Business Association.\nDavid Low, executive director of the Victoria Park BRZ, said what wasn't being discussed was the opportunity for the new Calgary\u00a0arena to serve as an \"economic engine\" for other areas of the district.\n\"It's all the support services and industries that go along with this,\" Low said. \"Let's forget about the entertainment centre for a minute. It's everything that is going to be around it \u2014 that has not been captured in many of the analysis\u00a0that has gone forward to date \u2014 that is very, very significant.\"\nThough plenty of Calgarians might feel frustrated with the deal today, Davison likened the situation to the initial conversation surrounding the new Central Library, which cost approximately $245 million for the building and related features.\n\"Day 1 that the (new arena) opens, yes, you may (convince more Calgarians),\" he said. \"You go back to the anger that a lot of people had investing money into the new Central Library\u00a0\u2014 'What a waste of money this was, how could you invest when libraries are going digital, we don't need this'\u00a0\u2014 but that library is on a\u00a0New York Times [top places to visit list].\n\"Today, when people walk into that building, they say, 'Wow, we built something spectacular.'\"\nCalgary resident Anthony Langlois said he was in favour of the deal, saying too much was made about the price tag and too little about how it would help to build a better city.\n\"We build a lot of different things that you do or do not use,\" he said. \"You're building a whole cultural landscape. The\u00a0fact is, this is going to be a city-owned asset that enhances the city's cultural landscape.\"\nCalgary resident Jesse\u00a0Vanneste also supports the arena deal.\n\"I understand where people are coming from, but I think the arena is a huge economic benefit to the city,\" Vanneste said.\u00a0\"I think people could come to our city from outside of town, all the surrounding communities, and I do think it brings an economic benefit to our city.\"\nThough the page has been turned on Calgary's new events centre, some think a whole new conversation could soon be started.\nMoshe Lander, a professor at\u00a0Concordia University, said he expected what had played out around the Flames arena would soon be replicated for Calgary's McMahon Stadium.\n\"You know, the CFL commissioner comes through town and says, 'You know, I don't know if we're going to have any more Grey Cups here until McMahon is replaced,'\" Lander said. \"The thing is, the Stamps are (also)\u00a0owned by Calgary Sports and Entertainment. So guess what, they now know the playbook on how to beat the city into putting public funds into a rebuilt stadium.\n\"So I think what we're going to see now is a slow-motion replay of what's been playing out over the last three years with the Saddledome.\"\nDavison called McMahon a \"much different ballpark,\" adding that the city was a long way\u00a0away from figuring out next steps at that site.\n\"We only have 40 acres there. The province owns the other 68 acres \u2026 the university is involved in that conversation,\" he said. \"But at the same time, you say, collectively, there's 100 acres there.\u00a0\n\"Could you potentially look at building a field house and a covered stadium and develop a district there\u00a0that could then offset that build and recoup our cost through the generation of new property tax? I don't know. Those are the conversations we're having now.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1531959875940", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1581885507812", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1530473539813", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1530471491827", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Commonwealth games officials feel 'excitement and energy' in Hamilton visit", "description": "Hamilton100 says its focused on delivering a bid that will benefit everyone in the city", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/commonwealth-games-hamilton100-1.5234711", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234877.1564769472!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/commonwealth-games-hamilton.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 02, 2019 2:37 PM ET", "2019-08-02T18:37:55.403Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Commonwealth games officials wrapped up a three-day whirlwind tour of Hamilton Friday as\u00a0the community\u00a0continues its campaign to bring the event back to the city where it all began for its 100th anniversary.\nThe 2030 games mark a milestone for both the games and Hamilton, the city where the first-ever\u00a0version of the games, then known as the British Empire Games, back in 1930.\nSince then, every attempt\u00a0to spark enthusiasm around hosting the games again has fizzled. But this time a community group called Hamilton100\u00a0is leading the pack with a focus on engaging the community and building excitement around the games.\nThat passion\u00a0wasn't lost on David Grevemberg, CEO of the Commonwealth Games Federation during his visit to various venues across the city this week.\nDuring a media conference\u00a0he spoke of a\u00a0\"fantastic swell of enthusiasm, excitement and energy\" and said the city could be a \"real contender.\"\n\"We're really proud to call Hamilton a proud city of the Commonwealth, because the citizens and communities are really benefiting from the power of sport,\" Grevemberg added, saying the city is home to world-class venues that are already being used to attract business.\nAs for the idea of circling back to Hamilton for the 100th anniversary, the CEO said doing so would provide an opportunity to showcase how both the games and the city have evolved.\n\"I think there's some wonderful synergies there. If the planets are aligned and this looks like something that's going to work for everybody \u2026 I think there could be some really amazing opportunities.\"\nBut, despite the novelty of circling back for such a significant celebration, there's no guarantee\u00a0the games will wind up in Hamilton.\nWhile the milestone might be important to Canadians, it will most likely be lost on other 70 nations and territories that vote on which city will be host.\n\"For them it's going to be the 100th anniversary no matter where it's held,\" pointed out Linda Cuthbert, director of Commonwealth Games Canada and chair of the country's bid and hosting committee.\nShe said several Canadian cities are interested in hosting the games. Each hopeful will have to submit Part 1 of their hosting plan, including its vision and general ideas around finances and budgeting by Nov. 22.\nPart 2 of the plan is due in March and Cuthbert said all levels of government must be on board with a bid before Canada's preferred bid is moved forward internationally.\nThat's important because while words like \"destiny\" and \"excitement\" were tossed around during Friday's\u00a0update,\u00a0there are still plenty of unanswered questions around the games.\nHamilton is still at the dialogue stage of the process.\u00a0The bid is in the\u00a0exploratory stage meaning the city hasn't locked down the games, let alone been chosen as the Canadian city which will get to try for them.\nAlthough council has supported Hamilton100's\u00a0involvement in the bidding process, some councillors are still raising questions about how much of the cost the city will have to carry. Preliminary estimates for the 2018\u00a0Commonwealth Games\u00a0in Australia indicate a price tag of over $1.8 billion. The cost to hold the 2022 games in Birmingham, England is\u00a0expected to hit about $1.5 billion.\nHamilton100 bid president P.J. Mercanti\u00a0said over the next three months they'll be working to put together a business plan which will be presented to council in November.\nHe stressed the bid is all about delivering maximum value to Hamilton's citizens, with plans for accessible youth sports programs before and after the games, along with a focus on affordable housing solutions.\nNow, thanks to the visit, he added, the team is also armed with new \"operating models and efficiencies\" passed along by the commonwealth federations which will help reduce the cost of the games and make sure they're \"right-sized\" for the city.\nIn the meantime, Mercanti said, the biggest challenge they face is making sure everyone in Hamilton \u2014 including council \u2014understands the benefits the games could bring.\n\"The games are a catalyst for change in the community,\" he explained. \"It's more than just sport. It's about community building.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1579821123733", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Joanne Chianello", "title": "We're officially a big city.

This is our best guess, based on statistics. When Mayor Jim Watson makes the pronouncement of our seven-figure population milestone in front of City Hall Friday afternoon, he won't be able to name our one-millionth resident.\nBut he is right to mark this as a\u00a0turning point, if only symbolically.\nOttawa's population blooms to 1M\nFor too long now, we've debated whether we're a small big city or a big small one. Too often, innovative ideas from elsewhere have been met with the response: \"That'll never work in Ottawa.\" And for goodness sakes, we\u00a0are not the city that fun forgot.\nBut what does it actually mean to be a city of one million?\nWell, for starters, it doesn't make us all that big, not in the global scheme of things. Heck, it only makes us the sixth-largest city in Canada, and way down the list of North America's largest urban centres. California alone boasts three cities larger than Ottawa.\nThese things are relative, though.\nIn the past 20 years, Ottawa's population has jumped by one-third. Just by dint of that rapid growth, we can now support a new mass transit system \u2014 assuming it eventually works\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a new central\u00a0library, more restaurants, local farmers markets across the city, renewed inner-city neighbourhoods and booming suburbs.\nOur city is diverse\u00a0\u2014 about one-quarter of Ottawa's residents were born outside Canada \u2014\u00a0a fact our\u00a0festival scene reflects gloriously.\nThis month alone, you can drop by\u00a0Preston Street's annual Italian festival or\u00a0the Festival Franco-Ontarien at Major's Hill Park, and cheer on the paddlers competing in\u00a0the Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival.\nThe Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival and International Competition Pow Wow remind\u00a0us who was here first.\nBut diversity doesn't just mean variety in our roots. It's also about contemporary cultural range.\u00a0So, catch some short plays at The Fringe, party at Centretown's GlowFair, rock out at Escapade or\u00a0find your\u00a0groove at the Ottawa Jazz Festival.\nMore of us means we can support more professional sports teams, too, although population alone is no guarantee of a franchise's success, as evidenced by the dismal attendance at Ottawa Senators\u00a0games last season.\nSurpassing this\u00a0population milestone needn't\u00a0necessarily alter the essence of our city \u2014 the approachable livability we long to preserve.\nOur proximity to nature, our bike path network, our transit system, the national museums and monuments \u2014 all these make Ottawa an ideal place to live for so many. And while housing prices have been on the rise, they haven't quite hit the socially disruptive\u00a0levels seen in Toronto or Vancouver.\nNone of this is to suggest we should be content with the status quo. Indeed, if we don't keep pushing for improvements, our envied livability will fall rapidly away.\nAs we continue to grow, we need a mass transit system that can reliably whisk us around this geographically\u00a0giant city of ours. We need more affordable housing. We lack a large central park in the core, and that's a big gap if we want more people to live there in more compact personal spaces. Our bike network is failing riders and urgently needs fixing.\nTall buildings? Yes, they're here to stay, and more are coming. We need to get over that. But we also need to demand that neck-craning\u00a0development is done right, and done honestly. It's not OK for a community to help develop a plan for 30-storey buildings, only to see\u00a0that plan arbitrarily changed to allow 50-plus storey towers.\nAnd it's certainly not acceptable for a hotel owner to fasten\u00a0a publicly loathed addition onto a beloved heritage building that will mar some of the most iconic views in the capital\u00a0and, for that matter, the country.\nDevelopers aren't doing the city a favour by building here. They make money. We're allowed, therefore, to make certain demands.\nWe must strive for the best version of whatever project we're undertaking, not concede to settle. The old argument that\u00a0the Lansdowne\u00a0Park redevelopment is better than the asphalt parking lot it replaced is far too low a bar.\nAs a city, what we need, in the words of former mayor Larry O'Brien, is a bit of swagger.\nAnd the willingness to try something new. The spirit to take a chance.\nSure, we secretly prize the security of being a government town, but that can make us a bit risk-averse. We need to get over that, too.\nBack when Canada celebrated its centenary, the famous Morrison-Lamothe bakery didn't just build\u00a0a nine-metre\u00a0styrofoam birthday cake for Parliament Hill; it\u00a0also served real cake to the tens of thousands of people who came to the Canada Day festivities, and all with just a month's notice.\nFifty years later, tens of thousands waited in security lines on Parliament Hill. Among the other disappointments that day, there was no cake.\nWhy not? In 1967, a single bakery was able to feed 40,000 people, but in 2017 we didn't have the imagination to showcase our culinary talent by commissioning the city's dozens of excellent bakeries\u00a0to provide treats for the hungry throngs.\nWe just need a bit of imagination, and we are capable of it.\nOne of the happiest surprises of the 150th celebrations was La Machine, whose massive mechanical creatures \u2014\u00a0a fire-breathing dragon-horse and a giant spider \u2014\u00a0stalked\u00a0the streets of downtown Ottawa. More than 750,000 people came out to see the $4.5-million spectacle.\nJust the bureaucratic effort needed to close city streets for the spectacle made it seem so un-Ottawa. But that's exactly the sort of what-the-heck, let's-do-it-anyway\u00a0attitude we need to bring to all sorts of collective projects, from the frivolous to the fundamental.\nIf it had failed, we would have all complained.

This is our best guess, based on statistics. When Mayor Jim Watson makes the pronouncement of our seven-figure population milestone in front of City Hall Friday afternoon, he won't be able to name our one-millionth resident.\nBut he is right to mark this as a\u00a0turning point, if only symbolically.\nOttawa's population blooms to 1M\nFor too long now, we've debated whether we're a small big city or a big small one. Too often, innovative ideas from elsewhere have been met with the response: \"That'll never work in Ottawa.\" And for goodness sakes, we\u00a0are not the city that fun forgot.\nBut what does it actually mean to be a city of one million?\nWell, for starters, it doesn't make us all that big, not in the global scheme of things. Heck, it only makes us the sixth-largest city in Canada, and way down the list of North America's largest urban centres. California alone boasts three cities larger than Ottawa.\nThese things are relative, though.\nIn the past 20 years, Ottawa's population has jumped by one-third. Just by dint of that rapid growth, we can now support a new mass transit system \u2014 assuming it eventually works\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a new central\u00a0library, more restaurants, local farmers markets across the city, renewed inner-city neighbourhoods and booming suburbs.\nOur city is diverse\u00a0\u2014 about one-quarter of Ottawa's residents were born outside Canada \u2014\u00a0a fact our\u00a0festival scene reflects gloriously.\nThis month alone, you can drop by\u00a0Preston Street's annual Italian festival or\u00a0the Festival Franco-Ontarien at Major's Hill Park, and cheer on the paddlers competing in\u00a0the Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival.\nThe Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival and International Competition Pow Wow remind\u00a0us who was here first.\nBut diversity doesn't just mean variety in our roots. It's also about contemporary cultural range.\u00a0So, catch some short plays at The Fringe, party at Centretown's GlowFair, rock out at Escapade or\u00a0find your\u00a0groove at the Ottawa Jazz Festival.\nMore of us means we can support more professional sports teams, too, although population alone is no guarantee of a franchise's success, as evidenced by the dismal attendance at Ottawa Senators\u00a0games last season.\nSurpassing this\u00a0population milestone needn't\u00a0necessarily alter the essence of our city \u2014 the approachable livability we long to preserve.\nOur proximity to nature, our bike path network, our transit system, the national museums and monuments \u2014 all these make Ottawa an ideal place to live for so many. And while housing prices have been on the rise, they haven't quite hit the socially disruptive\u00a0levels seen in Toronto or Vancouver.\nNone of this is to suggest we should be content with the status quo. Indeed, if we don't keep pushing for improvements, our envied livability will fall rapidly away.\nAs we continue to grow, we need a mass transit system that can reliably whisk us around this geographically\u00a0giant city of ours. We need more affordable housing. We lack a large central park in the core, and that's a big gap if we want more people to live there in more compact personal spaces. Our bike network is failing riders and urgently needs fixing.\nTall buildings? Yes, they're here to stay, and more are coming. We need to get over that. But we also need to demand that neck-craning\u00a0development is done right, and done honestly. It's not OK for a community to help develop a plan for 30-storey buildings, only to see\u00a0that plan arbitrarily changed to allow 50-plus storey towers.\nAnd it's certainly not acceptable for a hotel owner to fasten\u00a0a publicly loathed addition onto a beloved heritage building that will mar some of the most iconic views in the capital\u00a0and, for that matter, the country.\nDevelopers aren't doing the city a favour by building here. They make money. We're allowed, therefore, to make certain demands.\nWe must strive for the best version of whatever project we're undertaking, not concede to settle. The old argument that\u00a0the Lansdowne\u00a0Park redevelopment is better than the asphalt parking lot it replaced is far too low a bar.\nAs a city, what we need, in the words of former mayor Larry O'Brien, is a bit of swagger.\nAnd the willingness to try something new. The spirit to take a chance.\nSure, we secretly prize the security of being a government town, but that can make us a bit risk-averse. We need to get over that, too.\nBack when Canada celebrated its centenary, the famous Morrison-Lamothe bakery didn't just build\u00a0a nine-metre\u00a0styrofoam birthday cake for Parliament Hill; it\u00a0also served real cake to the tens of thousands of people who came to the Canada Day festivities, and all with just a month's notice.\nFifty years later, tens of thousands waited in security lines on Parliament Hill. Among the other disappointments that day, there was no cake.\nWhy not? In 1967, a single bakery was able to feed 40,000 people, but in 2017 we didn't have the imagination to showcase our culinary talent by commissioning the city's dozens of excellent bakeries\u00a0to provide treats for the hungry throngs.\nWe just need a bit of imagination, and we are capable of it.\nOne of the happiest surprises of the 150th celebrations was La Machine, whose massive mechanical creatures \u2014\u00a0a fire-breathing dragon-horse and a giant spider \u2014\u00a0stalked\u00a0the streets of downtown Ottawa. More than 750,000 people came out to see the $4.5-million spectacle.\nJust the bureaucratic effort needed to close city streets for the spectacle made it seem so un-Ottawa. But that's exactly the sort of what-the-heck, let's-do-it-anyway\u00a0attitude we need to bring to all sorts of collective projects, from the frivolous to the fundamental.\nIf it had failed, we would have all complained. But if we're too afraid to fail, then we will do nothing of significance.\u00a0\nThat's what it will take for a million of us to feel like we don't just happen to live in the same place, but that we've chosen to share the same spirit.\nA little more risk-taking, a tad more swagger and an insistence on excellence.\nNo, we're not on the cusp of becoming the next New York or Paris.

They were criticized nearly immediately as promoting anti-immigrant rhetoric.\nPetitions have since sprung up calling on billboard owners Pattison Outdoor Advertising to take the ads down, arguing that they violate the company's own code of conduct.\nThe company released two statements on Sunday, the first of which said that people who have a problem with the ads should take it up with the advertiser, True North Strong & Free Advertising Corp. The statement suggested they reviewed the ad content and it did not violate the Ad Standards of Canada (ASC) code or their own policies.\n\"We take a neutral position on ads that comply with the ASC code as we believe Canadians do not want us to be the judge or arbiter of what the public can or cannot see,\" the company said in a statement circulated on their social media accounts.\n\"Should advertising elicit a public debate, we encourage Canadians to voice their opinions directly to the advertiser who placed the message as it is our policy that their contact information must be a legible part of the ad.\"\nBut later in the day, the company issued a second statement saying that while the billboards didn't violate any policy, they would come down nonetheless.\n\"It was never my or Pattison Outdoor's intention to offend, alienate or in any way insult the public by allowing this ad to be run,\" company president Randy Otto wrote, adding that the company would review its advocacy guidelines.\nHe said that neither he nor anyone else at the company endorses the message of the advertiser.\nOtto wrote that Pattison will inform True North Advertising Corp. of its decision on Monday, and the ads will come down as soon as possible.\nMessage from Randy Otto, President Pattison Outdoor Advertising. <a href=\"https://t.co/rEYJRndHbL\">pic.twitter.com/rEYJRndHbL</a>\nAt the People's Party national campaign launch Sunday in Sainte-Marie, Que., Bernier said he agreed with the ad's message, though noted they were placed by an outside group.\nHe said the current number of immigrants Canada accepts annually \u2014 350,000 \u2014 is too high and needs to be scaled back.\n\"For me, mass immigration is 350,000 a year so yes we're against mass immigration,\" he said.\nThe phrase, however, is associated with more than just numbers.\nCritics of the term often consider it a synonym for opposition to visible minority immigrants on the grounds they pose a threat.\nCritics of the ad were interpreting it that way. The premier of Nova Scotia called the tone \"negative, divisive,\" while one Calgary resident who posted a petition calling for their removal said the ads are hurtful to newcomers and don't recognize their contribution to Canadian culture.\nThe ads also appeared in Hamilton, Ont., where the mayor and the chair of the local public school board spoke out against them.\n\"Outrageous,\" tweeted Alex Johnstone, chair of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board.\n\"I am the daughter of an immigrant. My dad and his family came to Hamilton from Newcastle for steel jobs and a better life. Most Canadians have immigrant heritage.\"\nMayor Fred Eisenberger said his family moved to Hamilton from Amsterdam for \"a better future.\"\n\"Immigrants have and will continue to make our country better,\" he said on Twitter.\nThe People's Party of Canada platform says specifically that \"mass immigration\" is used as a tool by mainstream parties to buy immigrant votes and that it drives up housing prices.\nThe party also says immigration \"should not be used to forcibly change the cultural character and social fabric of our country. And it should not put excessive financial burdens on the shoulders of Canadians in the pursuit of humanitarian goals.\"\nAccording to a filing with Elections Canada, the third-party group behind the ads is run by Frank Smeenk, the chief executive of a Toronto-based mining exploration company.\nThe group filed interim financial returns with Elections Canada that show it spent $59,890 on billboards in \"select cities in Canada\" and received $60,000 from Bassett & Walker International Inc., a company that specializes in the international trade of protein products.\nSmeenk declined to comment and messages left at Bassett & Walker were not returned.\nPolls suggest the People's Party of Canada has around four per cent of voter support heading into the October election, and thus far, Bernier has been excluded from the official leadership debates.\nOn Sunday, Bernier was greeted by hundreds of raucous supporters who cheered his every word as he pitched his case for inclusion in the debates and repeated promises to eliminate the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and corporate subsidies.\nBut at a grocery store down the road from the partisan gathering, some citizens expressed doubts about whether they would support their longtime MP under his new party's banner.\nMartin Roy, a resident of St-Isidore, said he worried that casting a ballot for Bernier could pave the way for Justin Trudeau's Liberals to win a second term.\n\"If our vote divides, what good is it?\" he mused.\nOthers at the store expressed admiration for the Conservative candidate, Richard Lehoux, a dairy producer supporting the supply management system Bernier has vowed to abolish.\nBernier acknowledged on Sunday that the race in his riding could be tight, and said he planned to campaign heavily there ahead of the election.\nBut for fans like Daniel Bouchette, who drove from Quebec City to attend the launch, Bernier's willingness to take political gambles is among his greatest strengths.\n\"He could have rested on his laurels, sure of re-election, but he had the courage to launch a new party to do things differently,\" he said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "The candidates: Nahendeh", "description": "Mike Drake, Randy Sibbeston, Eric Menicoche challenge incumbent Shane Thompson in multi-community riding", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-votes-nahendeh-candidates-1.5276913", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285973.1568670300!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/nahendeh.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 16, 2019 10:00 PM CT", "2019-09-17T04:00:00.495Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Election day in the Northwest Territories is Oct. 1, and CBC North is working to bring you all the information you need to cast your ballot.

The people have voiced to me that they want a person who will listen to them and take their issues forward and advocate for the people.\nI have spent my whole life in the service of the people. As an MLA, I bring this same philosophy to this position. I concluded my first term with a number of projects I was actively working on.\u00a0I would like to see these projects completed in the next four years.\nFor me, it is and always will be about representing the people and their voices.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI bring to the table a vast array of experience and knowledge. First and foremost, I have been the MLA for Nahendeh for the past four years.\u00a0I have also been elected by my peers to be the Chair of the Standing Committee of Social Development, which is responsible for over 60 per cent\u00a0of the government's operation and maintenance budget.\u00a0\nI also attended 98 other Standing Committee meetings to ensure the concerns of the people of Nahendeh were brought forth.\nMy previous experience includes\u00a0serving two terms on the Fort Simpson District Education Authority, four years as chair. Over the past thirty years I have served on various community and territorial boards.\nI have and still continue to be engaged with youth projects and initiatives on a volunteer basis. A few examples of my service to my community and the Northwest Territories are serving on the Sport North Federation Board and the NWTRPA\u00a0(NWT Parks and Recreation Association).\nI am an active volunteer with Northern Youth Abroad, Competency Based Education Training and High Five.\nI have served as a Justice of the Peace for over 25 years which afforded me the skills to listen to all the facts and make an informed decision.\u00a0This experience was an invaluable asset to my position as MLA.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nTo begin with, as the Chair of the Standing Committee of Social Development, we passed 23 bills, including the Corrections Act, Cannabis Act and the Post Secondary Act. This involved reaching out and meeting Northerners to get their viewpoint and bringing these viewpoints together to enhance these bills.\nIn the past four years, I have dealt with over 780 constituent issues. Many of these issues involved numerous communication\u00a0back\u00a0and forths with Ministers to provide answers to the issues,\u00a0In this way, we were able to identify workable solutions.\nI would like to discuss a number of highlights in the various communities within\u00a0Nahendeh. In Fort Liard, I worked toward a solution to the taxation issue and worked with the N.W.T. and B.C. governments to provide specialized medical services to the community.\u00a0\nIn Jean Marie River, I secured improvements on the access road, an additional teacher position, and a 20 kilometre chipseal on Highway 1, by the community turnoff. In Sambaa K'e, I advocated for enhancing the winter road, a renovation and addition to the school, and the construction of a new health cabin.\nHighlights in Wrigley over my term include working with the education minister on the school issue, addressing band land and housing issues with the GNWT\u00a0(Government of the Northwest Territories)\u00a0and federal government\u00a0\u2014 and issue that's been ongoing since 1965.\nNahanni Butte saw an additional teacher position in the community, enhancements to the access road, and the addressing of buffalo at the airport.\nFor Fort Simpson, I worked with the department of health and social services on planning a 48-bed long-term care facility project, and working with the Liidli Kue First Nation and Fort Simpson M\u00e9tis Nation on the business plan. I was also involved in developing plans for an LNG\u00a0plant in the community.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nWith our debt being $1.1 billion and\u00a0getting closer to our debt ceilings, we have a number of issues which are interwoven:\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nHousing.\u00a0Public housing units have\u00a0a long waiting list and no new infrastructure is planned.\nEmployment is another major issue. We need to develop strategic spending which will stimulate employment opportunities, such as homecare.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIf I could choose one thing to accomplish, it would be the housing issue. It has a ripple effect on the foundational family ecosystem, along with the economy as a whole.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nI would like to see the GNWT develop more green projects, such as geothermal, LNG, solar and other creative ways to reduce the demand on diesel. We need to work with communities to come up with a plan that meets their needs and use\u00a0modern technology to enhance existing systems.\nWe have a perfect example in the community of Fort Providence where SSi Energy has developed a system to reduce the use of diesel fuel and utilize\u00a0waste heat for their business.\nWe need to develop a plan where\u00a0there is a fuel rebate at the pumps for residents, so they can continue a traditional lifestyle.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWhen speaking about change, the biggest challenge I have witnessed is the willingness to implement it. Our government has become comfortable with the status quo.\nThe first thing I would do is have the Finance Minister reach out to Northerners to hear their concerns and ideas on how to improve the GNWT's budget.\nDepartments need to do zero-based budgeting to eliminate redundancy and duplication of services in the system.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nIndigenous government processes need to be completed, which creates certainty for industry and investment.\nContracts need to be awarded to northern contractors for the economy to grow and flourish.\u00a0These contractors are invested not only in the local economy but in our communities as a whole. We also need creative ways to enhance tourism outside of the larger centres.\nI believe the utilization of green energy products would enhance the local economy. If you look at geothermal, not only does it operate the power plant, but the heat can be used to heat buildings and greenhouses we build that will allow us to grow our own food.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI am very fortunate to be working with and along side a number of Indigenous governments and people in my riding. To me, it is about building positive relationships. I make it a point to sit down and listen to what the people have to say and share.\nBuilding relationships is the cornerstone to serving; which fosters respectful, trusting relationships, which then builds healthier, more productive communities.\nI do my utmost to be honest and forthright in working through solutions to constituent issues, and authentic and transparent in the progress I am making. Delivery of authentic service to people is not delivered in lip service or a box that can be checked off. Service to people is not a cookie cutter approach.\u00a0Personal and professional integrity need\u00a0to be the guidepost.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nGetting elected by the residents of the Nahendeh is my priority, but if I am fortunate enough to be elected, I would be interested in putting my name forward for the ministerial portfolios.\nI feel my experience over the last four years would be an asset for a cabinet position. I believe in consensus government and feel we need to implement a process\u00a0where\u00a0regular MLAs have more of a say in what we are trying to achieve.\nWould you like to be premier?\nThis decision would be\u00a0dependent upon who puts their name forward in the 19th\u00a0Assembly. I would like to see a Premier who engages with the residents of the Northwest Territories, challenges the status quo and actively works with regular MLAs on various issues and challenges.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nThe main reason would be to help the region move forward. It has been many years since the region has had any major infrastructure projects. I also believe it's time Nahendeh had a seat on the cabinet (none in 15 years) and I believe I have the necessary credentials to be successful.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nWhile I am not fluent, I have an ever-increasing ability to speak some South Slavey.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe fiscal situation is not great. The next group of MLAs and cabinet are going to have a tough time balancing competing interests.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nBasic infrastructure needing immediate repair. Our highways in the region desperately need some chipseal or better,\u00a0and that means more GNWT spending in\u00a0Nahendeh. There are many more pressing concerns as well.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nWell, I don't like to limit my potential accomplishments to only one, there are so many things I would like to help remedy.\nThere is, of course, the Dehcho Land Claim Process that has been stalled for some time. If I am able to provide any assistance I certainly would. I think the best way I could assist in this area would be to gain a cabinet seat and move the claim agenda forward.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nLobby the federal government for the funding needed to address the issue. Community governments are already at their limits financially and this is a cost that's really hard to absorb into their regular budgets. The GNWT may find it difficult to come up with necessary funding as well.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nIf there was an area needing to be changed, I feel the GNWT could do a better job consulting or advising the public. Some departments do a much better job with public consultation than others and I believe consistency would be helpful.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy ?\nA multi-faceted approach is required.\u00a0This must include partnering with others, like the feds, and of course industry.\u00a0\nWe need to create an environment that not only improves the economy but protects the natural environment at the same time.\nOne of the biggest road blocks to improving the economy in Nahendeh\u00a0is our\u00a0infrastructure deficiencies, specifically our highways.\u00a0There are also major concerns when looking at acquiring any land for any economic\u00a0development, particularly in\u00a0Nahendeh.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nFirst and foremost, I will provide equal MLA representation to all Nahendeh constituents.\nThere have been many improvements to this relationship over the last 10 years or so, things like the implementation of government services officers in many smaller communities has assisted considerably in\u00a0communication\u00a0to the Indigenous communities in our region. We should continue this type of community-based program and enhance the program even further.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nYes.\nWould you like to be premier? \nOf course.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nThe people in our district,\u00a0Nahendeh, which in our Dene language means \"our land,\" have many questions and the territorial government is not hearing them. I\u00a0decided this was the only forum where, when elected, I would speak for them, plus for those who share our land with us.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nMy elders, grandfathers are from this land. My parents were trappers, and with great sadness they sent\u00a0me to the residential school at Lapointe Hall when I was six years old,\u00a0but they saw that their way of life was changing and this was the only way to survive for the future.\nThe price I had to pay was to be separated from my family and community and lose part of my language. As a young Dene person after finishing my education, I was lost for a long time. I\u00a0got into alcohol, and did not care until\u00a0my auntie started taking me to the Indian Brotherhood \u2014 now Dene Nation \u2014 meetings and I listened to the elders from different Dene regions.\nThey kept saying, \"we are Dene, and this is our land, and we have been here since time immemorial. We come from strong and proud people.\"\u00a0From that moment, I knew who I was and knew what I wanted to do with my life: to work for our people.\nI've worked for the GNWT in economic development and justice, trapped\u00a0for a few years on my parents' trapping area, helped the band in Simpson to set up a company \u2014 Nogha\u00a0Enterprises \u2014 to do a highway maintenance contract, fire fighting contract, and pipeline work, among other things.\nI've done every job out there in my lifetime, and the Dene values that my mother and elders instilled me is prevalent respect. Care, listen, and help people.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nBeing Dene and sober for 31 years.\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nGetting an identity. A proper name, instead of N.W.T. A\u00a0name from the people of this land.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nNahendeh has five smaller\u00a0communities plus Fort Simpson.\u00a0It is not like Yellowknife, where MLAs\u00a0represent\u00a0three\u00a0blocks each. Each of the six\u00a0communities has dreams and visions for their people for the future, and for their children, so\u00a0they have a good life.\nThe problem is that there is limited funding from the territorial government and federal government to carry them out.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nFor the GNWT to step away or quit being involved in the negotiations that the First Nations are having with the federal government.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nVoice our concern,\u00a0practice what we preach, and start educating our people right from kindergarten.\u00a0They are our future.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nI have nothing against the system. It is doing its best to deliver quality services with the budget they have, but the people working within the territorial government system have to remember they are dealing with proud and humble people, that\u00a0it takes a lot of energy to ask for help, and they would like to be respected instead of being treated like a statistic.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy ?\nConsultation with the First Nations of this land.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nTo respect and consult and take direction from each First Nation on this land.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nNo.\nWould you like to be premier?\u00a0\nNo. As with the last question, I think that the people are more important than being in a higher position.\n"}, {"author": "Scott Dippel ", "title": "Secret Olympic reports show how ill-fated bid evolved over time", "description": "Release of confidential reports reveal gems like 'hosting the Games is inherently high risk'", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/city-council-olympics-2026-bid-documents-1.5180766", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180896.1560909157!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/confidential-olympic-documents-released.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 19, 2019 5:30 AM MT", "2019-06-19T11:30:00.192Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Now that Calgary's scuttled 2026 Winter Olympics bid has been legally and officially laid to rest by city council, some of the hidden details have been released by the city.\nSome 398 documents and reports were prepared for city council, but 39 of those documents were withheld from the public under the terms of Alberta's Freedom of Information legislation.\nFollowing a city council vote Monday, the city has now released 27 of those reports.

There was something about another young girl \u2014 also on the cusp of puberty, but speaking with the voice and vocabulary of a demon, housing supernatural evil within her slight frame \u2014 that haunted me for years after I watched it. Fear of female sexuality and agency have long created social anxieties, but that wasn't the fear that drove me. What really got me about Regan's demonic possession was her lack of control. She could watch as this demon moved with her arms and legs and listen as it spoke with her tongue, but she couldn't do anything herself. She was totally and utterly helpless.\nWatching the state of the world unfurl across my Twitter timeline every day, it's hard not to feel the tendrils of that old fear. I feel helpless to stop the tide of white supremacy rising within Canada; to stop the attitudes that contribute to Black and brown folks being targeted for police violence and incarceration; to stop immigrants and refugees from being treated like societal poison to be sucked out of the body politic; to stop my Indigenous sisters, cousins, aunties and friends from wondering if they're going to end up missing or murdered with the country's news editors downplaying their plight; to stop the ever-increasing rate of environmental degradation that will no doubt one day kill us all.\nConsidering all of these fears, it might come as a surprise that the only genre I really want to engage with these days is horror. But there's comfort in witnessing a world where the horror eventually stops \u2014 even if that world is fictional. In a horror book or movie, there's usually some sort of reason for terror to infiltrate and obliterate characters' lives: a character played with a Ouija board, or a family moved into a haunted hotel, or a housing development was built on an Indian burial ground (more on this later). There's usually some internal logic to be followed in this world until the terror is eventually overcome \u2014 the kind of logic that isn't offered by the horrors of reality.\nIn \"Glossary of a Haunting,\" Eve Tuck and C. Ree explain that American horror is \"preoccupied with the hero, who is perfectly innocent, but who is assaulted by monstering or haunting just the same.\" With this in mind, it's particularly interesting to follow modern Indigenous horror. If the creators of Western horror believe Indigenous genocide only belongs in the national consciousness as a horror trope \u2014 the infamous \"Indian burial ground,\" which for the record should be all of this continent \u2014 and that the people (often white) haunted by our ancestors' ghosts are innocent victims, what do the descendants of those ghosts fear? What more is there to fear when you've already faced governments who have tried for centuries to wipe you out, who have used biological warfare and forced starvation to create apocalypse for your people?\nIt's remarkable to consider that many non-Indigenous horror writers depict situations that Indigenous people have already weathered \u2014 such as apocalyptic viral outbreaks that decimate whole populations \u2014 or use the history of genocidal violence against us to explain why innocent white folks are being haunted today, such as in Stephen King's It or the 1982 film Poltergeist. In fact, I'm not sure what scares non-Indigenous horror writers and readers more: experiencing variations of what Indigenous folks have already endured for centuries, or the reality that they have built their entire country on literal Indian burial grounds.\nIndigenous writers, on the other hand, acknowledge the mundane horror of living in a country that dehumanizes you, weaving the reality of Indigenous life with fiction to scare audiences. In Waubgeshig Rice's Moon of the Crusted Snow, for example, the apocalyptic event that ends life as we know it \u2014 taking out power, internet, phones, satellites, etc. \u2014 isn't even really noticed as an apocalyptic event at first; it's just another day on a northern rez, where power can go out at any time and internet and phone signals aren't always available. As Nick, a young Anishinaabe man, points out, \"We thought it was kinda funny...The blackout was only two days, but it seemed like some people were already freaking out a little bit. I was just like, 'Come to the rez, this shit happens all the time!'\" Once it becomes apparent that things have changed forever, the protagonist Evan observes that \"the milestones he [now] used to mark time were the deaths in the community\u2026as people perished through sickness, mishap, violence or by their own hands.\" He notes that northern reserves like his are \"familiar with tragedy,\" the result of generations of intergenerational trauma and genocide \u2014 only now this tragedy is magnified.\nSimilarly, Jeff Barnaby's new movie Blood Quantum takes the real-life horror of Indigenous history and plugs it into a zombie horror film. In Barnaby's film, a zombie virus ravages a non-Indigenous community that borders a reserve; the only thing that saves the Indigenous community from the same fate is their apparent immunity to that virus. The community's decision to take in non-Native survivors, who may turn into zombies and kill their people, is a fraught one for the film's characters. Considering the devastation viruses carried by white settlers have historically wrought on Indigenous communities \u2014 the 1862 smallpox epidemic is estimated to have cut the First Nations population in what's now known as British Columbia in half \u2014 it's not hard to understand why.\nIn her bestselling book The Marrow Thieves, Cherie Dimaline used the real history of residential schools to create a terrifying post-apocalyptic world where Indigenous children are hunted and harvested for their bone marrow. Her latest novel, Empire of Wild, similarly uses the M\u00e9tis tale of the Rogarou to tell a story of religion and resource extraction. The Rogarou was originally a story told to young Indigenous children, particularly girls, to keep them from the roads near the edge of their communities, where white men would pick them up and they'd end up missing or murdered. They scared their children in an attempt to keep them alive.\nUnlike in a book or movie, these horrors haven't stopped, either. I recently heard M\u00e9tis-Cree author and scholar Jesse Thistle read from his bestselling book From the Ashes: My Story of Being Metis, Homeless and Finding My Way. Thistle introduced his reading from by bringing up the Rogarou, which he originally heard about from Dimaline. \"This passage,\" he said, \"describes my encounter with the Rogarou.\" He went on to describe being violently and randomly attacked by white strangers \u2014a scenario that countless white women have suffered in countless horror movies. The difference, of course, is that fictitious white women in horror movies are almost always considered innocent by viewers; Indigenous men are not, no matter the circumstances.\nIn Billy-Ray Belcourt's newest poetry collection, NDN Coping Mechanisms: Notes from the Field, there is a poem titled \"Canadian Horror Story.\" In it, Belcourt grapples with the deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie \u2014 as well as the injustice of their accused murderer's trials. \"It feels unethical to age,\" Belcourt writes, summoning the survivor's guilt all Indigenous people carry when they outlive friends, relatives, even complete strangers. Then he turns his attention to non-Indigenous Canada: \"An entire citizenry is implicated...How does it feel to live in an asylum you built bone by sooty bone?\"\nPerhaps there will come a time when white Canada will meaningfully grapple with this question, when I won't have to look to horror to find a world where the monsters eventually stop. Until then, Tuck and Ree have put it best: \"Haunting is the cost of subjugation. It is the price paid for violence, for genocide...I don't want to haunt you, but I will.\"\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Conservatives enter 40-day federal campaign flush with cash, focused on Quebec", "description": "Party should have enough money on hand to spend $28.1 million, the maximum allowed under federal law", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-campaign-launch-story-1.5278260", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279512.1568224096!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-conservatives-20190911.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 11, 2019 11:00 AM ET", "2019-09-11T21:04:01.568Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Conservatives are determined to make Justin Trudeau a one-term prime minister as they\u00a0look to send their leader, Andrew Scheer, from the opposition benches to the seat of government.\nThe party, which has outstripped its rivals' fundraising efforts by millions of dollars, already has begun blanketing the airwaves with TV ads trying to familiarize Canadians with Scheer.\nIn the last quarter, the Conservative Party of Canada raised more than the Liberal, New Democrat and Green parties combined. It should have enough cash on hand to spend the maximum allowable by law: $28.1 million for the national campaign.\nThe party also has vetted and nominated a full slate of 338 candidates ahead of the other parties.\nThe Conservatives have\u00a0secured a campaign plane that's ready to take off today to bring Scheer to every part\u00a0of the country considered to be\u00a0in play in this election\u00a0\u2014 notably New Brunswick, rural Quebec\u00a0and parts of suburban Toronto and Vancouver.\n\"In politics, money talks,\" Andrew Brander, a strategist at Crestview and a former chief of staff to Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt, told CBC News. \"Honestly, from an organizational standpoint, (Conservatives) are certainly the best-positioned at this time. And they have a ballot box question \u2014 affordability \u2014 that will motivate their base to show up.\"\n\"You and your family are at the heart of the October 21 election. Who can you trust to help you and your family to get ahead? And the answer is not Justin Trudeau, who will only take more money from your pockets. He doesn't know what it's like to raise a family in difficult conditions,\" Scheer said at a campaign launch event.\nBrander said the party already has started sending out teams of canvassers to target key ridings \u2014 areas where they hope they can capitalize on Liberal weakness.\nThe party also has used some of its sizeable war chest to\u00a0bolster its digital approach to campaigning, Brander said.\nHe said the party has deployed a\u00a0new smartphone app that allows volunteers to access reams of voter data \u2014\u00a0information that can help party volunteers maximize their time at the doors of supporters and swing voters leaning Conservative.\nThe two cities that Scheer will visit Wednesday for the official campaign launch reveal a lot\u00a0about the kind of seats the Tories will be targeting over the next 40 days.\nScheer will start the day in Trois-Rivieres, Que., a predominantly francophone seat in the Quebec heartland between Montreal and Quebec City. He'll\u00a0finish the day with a rally in Woodbridge, Ont., a suburb of Toronto.\n\"The first week is very indicative of where the leaders believe the election can be won or lost. You'll see\u00a0Scheer\u00a0spend time in areas where he can pick up seats, but also in areas where can stave off some of the potential upsets. He's clearly targeting suburban families,\" Brander said.\nBrander said voters can expect to see Scheer\u00a0spend a lot of time along the Highway 401 corridor\u00a0as he looks to cobble together the same coalition that last year delivered conservative governments in Ontario and Quebec.\nConservatives also hope to steal away more seats like Chicoutimi-Le Fjord (Conservative candidate Richard Martel bested his Liberal opponent there in a 2018 byelection),\u00a0peel away Liberal ridings in vote-rich Mississauga and Brampton, Ont., and capitalize on NDP weakness in places like Saskatchewan and rural B.C., among others, to help them put together a majority government.\nBrander, a veteran of both federal and provincial conservative campaigns,\u00a0said the party has recruited some respected candidates in Quebec and is poised to gain from the\u00a0NDP's slump. \"The party has spent a lot resources rebuilding the party infrastructure in that province. I would expect Scheer to double down during the\u00a0campaign to make sure those results come through for him on election day,\" he said.\nScheer\u00a0reminded voters in Quebec Wednesday that it was the last Conservative government that officially recognized Quebec as a \"nation within a united Canada\" and gave the province a semi-formal presence at the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO).\nScheer said he'd need the support of the\u00a0\"Quebec nation\" in particular to \"restore integrity and accountability to government\" in Ottawa.\nScheer has narrowed what was once a significant polling advantage for Trudeau and the Liberals.\nAlmost a year ago to the day, the CBC's Poll Tracker put the Liberals in front by a healthy seven points among leaning and decided voters. Today, the two parties\u00a0are locked in a dead heat.\nWhile Scheer's Conservatives have lost some of the momentum they had in the spring during the peak of the SNC-Lavalin affair \u2014 a scandal that resulted in the departure of the prime minister's top adviser and two senior cabinet ministers\u00a0\u2014 they are still polling higher than the share of the vote Scheer's predecessor Stephen Harper won on election day in 2015, if only slightly.\u00a0The Conservatives took 31.9 per cent of the vote on election day 2015; they were polling at 33.8 per cent as of Sept. 10.\nThe Liberals, meanwhile, have dropped about five points in the polls since 2015\u00a0\u2014 from 39.5 per cent on election day to 33.8 per cent as of Sept. 10.\nThe Conservative Party has launched a series of television ads highlighting some of the prime minister's broken promises and warning voters that Trudeau \"isn't as advertised.\"\nAnother, more recent ad campaign\u00a0features the party's election slogan: \"It's time for you to get ahead.\"\nScheer, like his provincial conservative counterparts, has railed against the Liberal government's carbon tax, claiming it will make everyday life more expensive and vowing to scrap it, if elected. The Liberals maintain the initiative will lower greenhouse gas emissions and will be rebated to most families at tax time.\nThe party is expected to unveil a series of campaign commitments in the same vein. Already, the Conservatives have promised a non-refundable tax credit on maternity and parental leave\u00a0Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. They've also vowed to take the federal GST off sales of home heating fuels.\nScheer has said he will make his pitch to younger voters through a housing policy directed at millennials, many of whom are struggling to buy homes in an era of sky-high housing prices in most of Canada's big cities.\nThe Conservatives believe affordability will be the ballot box question of this election, and they're hoping to attract the support of would-be Liberal defectors.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coming home: Vianne Timmons named as new MUN president", "description": "She has served as the president of University of Regina for the past 11 years", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/mun-president-announced-1.5393802", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5394533.1581015917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/vianne-timmons-mun-president.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 12, 2019 2:06 PM NT", "2019-12-12T22:05:35.354Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Memorial University has announced that Vianne Timmons will be taking over as president and vice-chancellor of the university.\u00a0\nTimmons\u00a0will replace longtime president\u00a0Gary Kachanoski, who ended his term about six months early and plans to teach at MUN.\nVianne Timmons, who grew up in Labrador City,\u00a0previously was the president and vice-chancellor of the University of Regina.

And\u00a0I'd be surprised, frankly, if anybody noticed, if nobody told them,\"\u00a0said Janet Gray, a personal financial planner from Orleans, Ont.\nThe basic personal amount\u00a0\u2014 the amount of annual income Canadians can keep\u00a0tax-free\u00a0\u2014 is slowly increasing over the next four years, to $15,000 by 2023. In previous years, this amount has been adjusted to\u00a0the rate of inflation, but Morneau's most recent enhancement\u00a0goes beyond that.\nFor\u00a0the\u00a02020 tax year, it's rising by $931, to $13,229.\nFor low-income Canadians who'd otherwise have to pay 15 per cent income tax on that amount, the annual tax savings could be about $140. Some of the poorest may no longer owe any tax at all.\n\"There is still about one million Canadians that earn less than that basic personal exemption,\" Gray said. \"So of course, that's going to be meaningful for them.\"\nFor Canadians in the middle-income\u00a0brackets, the annual savings could be up to $240.\nBut divide that across 26 bi-weekly pay periods and the income bump that starts appearing\u00a0on Canadian pay\u00a0stubs doesn't exactly look life-changing: it's enough for an extra cup of fancy coffee or, for higher earners, a food truck\u00a0lunch every two weeks.\nFor those earning more than $150,473 in annual income, the savings are partially clawed back,\u00a0or not offered at all for incomes over $214,368.\nFederal\u00a0tax brackets \u2014 the thresholds that\u00a0trigger higher rates of taxation as incomes rise \u2014\u00a0have been\u00a0adjusted for 2020 based on\u00a0a 1.9 per cent rate of inflation.\nGray points out that in several Canadian cities, particularly those with hot housing markets, the actual rate of inflation may be higher \u2014 which means that these tax brackets and sources of government income\u00a0like the Canada Child Benefit (also\u00a0indexed and rising slightly as of July 1,\u00a02020)\u00a0may not be\u00a0keeping up.\nWhen business or household budgets\u00a0are sensitive to things like rising food costs or higher\u00a0taxes on fossil fuels, the government's calculations fall behind taxpayers' lived reality.\n\"Some people are going to feel inflation more than others depending on their own lifestyle,\" Gray said.\u00a0\nFarther down the pay stub, deductions for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan are changing, too.\nEI\u00a0premiums are decreasing from 1.62 to 1.58 per cent in 2020, while the maximum insurable earnings will increase to $54,200 from $53,100.\nThat's a\u00a0saving, but don't spend it all at once: it amounts to\u00a0less than a dollar per bi-weekly paycheque.\nCPP premiums, on the other hand, are increasing from 5.1 to 5.25 per cent for employees (double that\u00a0for the self-employed)\u00a0and the maximum pensionable earnings\u00a0\u2014 the amount the government uses to calculate an employee's CPP contributions for the year \u2014 is going up to $58,700.\nFor those earning that much or more, deductions could increase by\u00a0about $5.73\u00a0per bi-weekly paycheque\u00a0(less for lower-income earners). But remember: today's CPP contributions become pension income at retirement, so CPP premiums are\u00a0a modest forced\u00a0savings program, not a tax.\n\"It's kind of painless, a little bit at a time,\" Gray said.\u00a0Young workers may find it difficult to save for retirement\u00a0and are\u00a0less likely than previous generations to have employer-sponsored pensions, so \"CPP is taking on a little bit more of that\u00a0job.\"\nThe problem, Gray said, is that many people max out their EI and CPP contributions before the end of the year, and get used to paycheques leading up to New Year's that have fewer deductions. When January comes around again, their net pay deposits drop\u00a0and \"it's a little bit of a shock.\"\nThis makes it harder to detect subtle deduction changes at the start of a new year.\nTaken together with Morneau's tax cut, \"I think it's going to be mostly a wash,\" Gray said.\nA few other tax items\u00a0change with the new calendar year.\nThe annual contribution limit for the tax-free savings account, which was launched in 2009,\u00a0doesn't change this year \u2014 it will be $6,000 as it was last year. Since your contribution room carries over year to year, eligible Canadians\u00a0will have a cumulative contribution room of\u00a0up to $69,500.\nFor those\u00a0considering upgrading professional skills, a new Canada Training Benefit allows\u00a0taxpayers to accumulate up to $250 per year toward a future tax credit to\u00a0offset\u00a0up to 50 per cent of eligible tuition costs.\nAnd those who spend some of their hard-earned income to support digital journalism will be able to\u00a0claim up to $500 in eligible subscriptions, for a tax credit worth up to $75, starting with their 2020 returns.\nAnother expected change was suddenly cancelled by Morneau's department late in the day on Dec.19: a move to start taxing stock options more like regular income.\nIn a press release, the department said that, following consultations with stakeholders,\u00a0\"the government will announce details on how it intends to move forward\" in the 2020 federal budget.\nPerhaps the most significant change for some Canadians is in the rebates they receive for living in provinces where they pay the federal carbon tax on things like gasoline and home heating fuels.\nAs of April 1, 2020, the federal price on carbon will rise from $20 to $30 per tonne of emissions. In line\u00a0with that, residents of four provinces will receive revised climate change incentives when they file their taxes this spring.\nIn Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the payments, based on household size, are higher than last year's.\nFor example, a single person in Ontario received $154 last year, but is eligible for $224 this year.\u00a0A family of four in Saskatchewan received $609 last year, but is eligible for $809 this year.\nNew Brunswick, which recently reached an agreement with the federal government on its carbon pricing\u00a0plan, will no longer be subject to the federal tax as of April 1 and its residents will not receive\u00a0rebates when they file their taxes.\u00a0\nGray said she doesn't think people make the connection between rising costs for things like gas\u00a0and the bonus they got at tax time.\n\"I don't know that it was a meaningful amount for many people, but it was still\u00a0nice to have,\" she said. \"It's a gift.\"\nWhich brings us to Albertans, who\u00a0will receive the federal incentive payments for the first time in 2020.\nTheir first payments are larger, to reflect three months when Albertans are paying a carbon tax based on $20 per tonne of emissions (January-March 2020) and twelve months when they're paying the $30/tonne price for 2020-21.\nAlberta\u00a0also generates relatively more carbon emissions that are now subject to the federal\u00a0tax, and the federal government pledged to return\u00a090 per cent of its carbon tax revenues.\nThe tax is meant to encourage households to consume less\u00a0carbon-polluting energy \u2014 so the\u00a0more people conserve, the more they benefit from the rebate.\nUnlike the provincial carbon pricing\u00a0scheme Premier Jason Kenney's government cancelled earlier this year, every Alberta household, regardless of income, is eligible.\nA single adult in Alberta will receive $444. A household of four will receive $888.\nNew climate incentive payments\u00a0could add\u00a0more to Albertans'\u00a0bottom lines than the Liberal tax cut.\n"}, {"author": "Janyce McGregor", "title": "Are 2020's tax changes 'significant' or 'a wash'?", "description": "Liberals' promised tax cut may help 20 million Canadians - but only a little", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tax-changes-2020-1.5402975", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5408092.1577209393!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1589060428.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 31, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-12-31T17:33:08.257Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Finance Minister Bill Morneau\u00a0introduced a motion earlier this month to keep the\u00a0Liberals' election pledge to cut income taxes for the middle class, he called the measure\u00a0\"significant\" and said it would\u00a0impact\u00a020 million Canadians.\nBut most Canadians would\u00a0have\u00a0to study their pay stubs very closely after Jan. 1 to detect that tax cut and other changes to deductions that arrive\u00a0with the new year.

Some of the poorest may no longer owe any tax at all.\n\"There is still about one million Canadians that earn less than that basic personal exemption,\" Gray said. \"So of course, that's going to be meaningful for them.\"\nFor Canadians in the middle-income\u00a0brackets, the annual savings could be up to $240.\nBut divide that across 26 bi-weekly pay periods and the income bump that starts appearing\u00a0on Canadian pay\u00a0stubs doesn't exactly look life-changing: it's enough for an extra cup of fancy coffee or, for higher earners, a food truck\u00a0lunch every two weeks.\nFor those earning more than $150,473 in annual income, the savings are partially clawed back,\u00a0or not offered at all for incomes over $214,368.\nFederal\u00a0tax brackets \u2014 the thresholds that\u00a0trigger higher rates of taxation as incomes rise \u2014\u00a0have been\u00a0adjusted for 2020 based on\u00a0a 1.9 per cent rate of inflation.\nGray points out that in several Canadian cities, particularly those with hot housing markets, the actual rate of inflation may be higher \u2014 which means that these tax brackets and sources of government income\u00a0like the Canada Child Benefit (also\u00a0indexed and rising slightly as of July 1,\u00a02020)\u00a0may not be\u00a0keeping up.\nWhen business or household budgets\u00a0are sensitive to things like rising food costs or higher\u00a0taxes on fossil fuels, the government's calculations fall behind taxpayers' lived reality.\n\"Some people are going to feel inflation more than others depending on their own lifestyle,\" Gray said.\u00a0\nFarther down the pay stub, deductions for Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan are changing, too.\nEI\u00a0premiums are decreasing from 1.62 to 1.58 per cent in 2020, while the maximum insurable earnings will increase to $54,200 from $53,100.\nThat's a\u00a0saving, but don't spend it all at once: it amounts to\u00a0less than a dollar per bi-weekly paycheque.\nCPP premiums, on the other hand, are increasing from 5.1 to 5.25 per cent for employees (double that\u00a0for the self-employed)\u00a0and the maximum pensionable earnings\u00a0\u2014 the amount the government uses to calculate an employee's CPP contributions for the year \u2014 is going up to $58,700.\nFor those earning that much or more, deductions could increase by\u00a0about $5.73\u00a0per bi-weekly paycheque\u00a0(less for lower-income earners). But remember: today's CPP contributions become pension income at retirement, so CPP premiums are\u00a0a modest forced\u00a0savings program, not a tax.\n\"It's kind of painless, a little bit at a time,\" Gray said.\u00a0Young workers may find it difficult to save for retirement\u00a0and are\u00a0less likely than previous generations to have employer-sponsored pensions, so \"CPP is taking on a little bit more of that\u00a0job.\"\nThe problem, Gray said, is that many people max out their EI and CPP contributions before the end of the year, and get used to paycheques leading up to New Year's that have fewer deductions. When January comes around again, their net pay deposits drop\u00a0and \"it's a little bit of a shock.\"\nThis makes it harder to detect subtle deduction changes at the start of a new year.\nTaken together with Morneau's tax cut, \"I think it's going to be mostly a wash,\" Gray said.\nA few other tax items\u00a0change with the new calendar year.\nThe annual contribution limit for the tax-free savings account, which was launched in 2009,\u00a0doesn't change this year \u2014 it will be $6,000 as it was last year. Since your contribution room carries over year to year, eligible Canadians\u00a0will have a cumulative contribution room of\u00a0up to $69,500.\nFor those\u00a0considering upgrading professional skills, a new Canada Training Benefit allows\u00a0taxpayers to accumulate up to $250 per year toward a future tax credit to\u00a0offset\u00a0up to 50 per cent of eligible tuition costs.\nAnd those who spend some of their hard-earned income to support digital journalism will be able to\u00a0claim up to $500 in eligible subscriptions, for a tax credit worth up to $75, starting with their 2020 returns.\nAnother expected change was suddenly cancelled by Morneau's department late in the day on Dec.19: a move to start taxing stock options more like regular income.\nIn a press release, the department said that, following consultations with stakeholders,\u00a0\"the government will announce details on how it intends to move forward\" in the 2020 federal budget.\nPerhaps the most significant change for some Canadians is in the rebates they receive for living in provinces where they pay the federal carbon tax on things like gasoline and home heating fuels.\nAs of April 1, 2020, the federal price on carbon will rise from $20 to $30 per tonne of emissions. In line\u00a0with that, residents of four provinces will receive revised climate change incentives when they file their taxes this spring.\nIn Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the payments, based on household size, are higher than last year's.\nFor example, a single person in Ontario received $154 last year, but is eligible for $224 this year.\u00a0A family of four in Saskatchewan received $609 last year, but is eligible for $809 this year.\nNew Brunswick, which recently reached an agreement with the federal government on its carbon pricing\u00a0plan, will no longer be subject to the federal tax as of April 1 and its residents will not receive\u00a0rebates when they file their taxes.\u00a0\nGray said she doesn't think people make the connection between rising costs for things like gas\u00a0and the bonus they got at tax time.\n\"I don't know that it was a meaningful amount for many people, but it was still\u00a0nice to have,\" she said. \"It's a gift.\"\nWhich brings us to Albertans, who\u00a0will receive the federal incentive payments for the first time in 2020.\nTheir first payments are larger, to reflect three months when Albertans are paying a carbon tax based on $20 per tonne of emissions (January-March 2020) and twelve months when they're paying the $30/tonne price for 2020-21.\nAlberta\u00a0also generates relatively more carbon emissions that are now subject to the federal\u00a0tax, and the federal government pledged to return\u00a090 per cent of its carbon tax revenues.\nThe tax is meant to encourage households to consume less\u00a0carbon-polluting energy \u2014 so the\u00a0more people conserve, the more they benefit from the rebate.\nUnlike the provincial carbon pricing\u00a0scheme Premier Jason Kenney's government cancelled earlier this year, every Alberta household, regardless of income, is eligible.\nA single adult in Alberta will receive $444. A household of four will receive $888.\nNew climate incentive payments\u00a0could add\u00a0more to Albertans'\u00a0bottom lines than the Liberal tax cut.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Mortgage insurer Genworth Canada may be sold as U.S. parent works on Chinese merger", "description": "Genworth MI competes with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/genworth-mortgage-canada-1.5196843", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3083745.1432309561!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/real-estate-condo-condominium-for-sale-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 02, 2019 12:26 PM ET", "2019-07-02T16:26:54.396Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada is up for sale as the company's U.S. parent is trying to streamline its operations as it works on being bought out itself by a Chinese buyer.\nVirginia-based\u00a0Genworth Financial Inc. is currently trying to hammer out the details of a deal that will see Chinese company\u00a0China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co.

Although Popa will specialize in Burmese cuisine, which he travelled to Myanmar to learn,\u00a0Bhagwani\u00a0said he's not holding out for a chef with specialized skills.\u00a0\"I don't mind people from any other cuisine \u2014\u00a0Mexican, French. I can train them.\"\nIn the third quarter of this year, the most recent period for which numbers are available, there were 67,370 vacant jobs in food service and drinking establishments across the country, according to Statistics Canada, the highest it's been in nearly five years.\nRecord low unemployment, shifting demographics and competition for workers from a slew\u00a0of new restaurants and food delivery services are making it tough for restaurants to find enough workers to operate at capacity \u2014 opening the patio in\u00a0summer or hosting private parties during the holidays. Executing expansion plans seems impossible.\nRestaurant owners and industry associations say they won't be able to rectify the problem without substantially increasing immigration to Canada, loosening the rules about who can move here to work in hospitality.\n\"It's been very tough,\" said Bhagwani, who has opened dozens of food establishments in the Toronto area, including the Amaya\u00a0chain\u00a0of Indian restaurants. \"I had to set up a central kitchen because I could not place chefs or cooks in each restaurant.\" Though he said he's offering competitive salaries, he's perennially shorthanded and actively recruiting.\n\"I have five restaurants that have extensively had ads for the last five months and have not been able to get a job match for one person locally,\" he said.\nHe did receive one email inquiry about\u00a0a dish-washing job recently. The sender was from Dubai.\u00a0\nIn the meantime,\u00a0he still has\u00a0to pay $20,000 per month rent at Popa while he works to find the staff he needs to open the doors.\nBhagwani\u00a0is not alone, said\u00a0David Lefebvre, vice president of\u00a0industry association Restaurants Canada.\u00a0\nWhat used to be referred to as\u00a0labour shortages, \"now there are some places in the country we call them labour outages because you just cannot open a restaurant or find any workers to work at your place,\" he said.\nQuebec, British Columbia and some parts of\u00a0Atlantic Canada have the worst shortages right now, said Lefebvre. \"But you see it in every provinces. You get some places like Banff in Alberta; even though Alberta has been in the economic slowdown, you still have some labour shortage in the food service industry.\"\nThere are a number of reasons why this is the case, including that food services traditionally attract\u00a0a young workforce and young workers are now a smaller portion of the population. Canadians under age 25 made up 48.1 per cent of the population in 1971, but were projected to make up\u00a0only 28.2 per cent in 2019, according to Statistics Canada.\nBut there are other forces draining the restaurant labour pool.\u00a0The overall unemployment rate reached historic lows in 2019, meaning\u00a0young people who might previously have worked in restaurants while waiting\u00a0to land a position in another field\u00a0instead have their pick of jobs.\nLabour Force Survey data shows that since 2016,\u00a0workers 24 and under have increased their numbers in fields like tech, transportation, retail and education.\nAlso, skyrocketing housing costs, especially in Canada's biggest cities, make it harder to get by on a line cook or server's salary \u2014 even with a heavy take home from tips.\u00a0\nBhagwani\u00a0said the housing shortage is\u00a0particularly hard on his kitchen staff. \"They used to pay $1,200 for a basement apartment; now they pay $1,800.\"\nWhy not simply increase salaries and let free market forces correct the problem?\nPay has gone up, said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO of\u00a0BC Restaurant and Food Services Association.\" For a kitchen worker, three\u00a0or four\u00a0years ago wages were $13 to 14, now they're $19 or $20.\"\nThe association has put also together optional benefits packages owners can offer to\u00a0part-time employees who work 20 hours or more per week.\nIn Toronto, Hemant Bhagwani\u00a0has even offered ownership shares and profit sharing to entice both chefs and front-of-house staff to join his team.\nBut Bhagwani said there are limits to how much pay can increase given tight profit margins.\u00a0\nRent, labour and food costs have all spiked in the last three to five years. \"Our profit margin used to be 15 to 18\u00a0per cent. Now our profit margin has dipped to probably five\u00a0per cent. And we can't even increase our prices with all these Ubers and Skip the Dishes. We're also competing with them also.\"\nConsumers have more ways than ever to avoid dirtying dishes in their kitchens at home, between a\u00a0host of new delivery services, the breadth of prepared foods on offer at the grocery store and U.S. chains such as\u00a0Eataly and The Cheesecake Factory opening in Canada. Even retailers like Nordstrom and Restoration Hardware have moved\u00a0into the food game with in-store cafes.\u00a0\nSome restaurants are turning to tech solutions to fill staffing gaps. Toronto entrepreneurs Erika Mozes and Josh Karam created an app called Hyr to connect restaurants that are short of staff with workers who can fill in on a per-shift basis.\nBoth restaurants and workers create social-media-style\u00a0profiles and\u00a0can rate each other. In some cases the pay is slightly higher or the tips likely to be generous,\u00a0but one of the main incentives for workers is that they\u00a0receive their pay within 48 hours of their shift, said Mozes.\n\"As a business, you can download hire, create a profile and literally within minutes be able to post a shift,\" she said.\nBartender Collin Heath said he loves\u00a0his full-time job,\u00a0but because he easily gets his 40 hours per week over the course of three or four shifts, he has time to pick up shifts through Hyr.\n\"Toronto's a really extremely expensive city to live in. And at some point you have to do everything that you can in order to make money,\" said Heath. \"It could be the 28th of the month and I have until the first, which is two or three days, to pay rent, and I know if I take the right job with Hyr, I'm paid within two days and that money is coming in.\"\u00a0\nAt Canada's biggest chef's school, the Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts at Toronto's\u00a0George Brown College, enrolment by Canadians has plateaued, while international students have increased by six-fold between 2009 and 2019, said director Tony Garcia.\nOpportunities abound for graduates. \"There are approximately six field placements available for every student,\" he said.\u00a0\nFirst year student\u00a0Nhuy Mai first moved to Toronto from Vietnam to study English, but stayed for George Brown's program when she decided to pursue a career in hospitality.\n\"Cooking is my passion so I chose this school,\" she said. Right now she works part-time at Thai restaurant\u00a0Mango Garden, and hopes to\u00a0continue working\u00a0in Canada\u00a0after graduation, then\u00a0open her own Vietnamese restaurant here\u00a0within a few years.\u00a0\u00a0\nHospitality needs more people like her, said Lefebvre of Restaurants Canada. He said the industry wants the government to loosen rules about who can come to Canada to work in the\u00a0field so it's not just trained chefs who can move here, but front-of-house and other kitchen staff, too.\nHe said the organization wants a \"multi-pronged\" approach that also makes it easier for people on employment insurance or students with\u00a0bursaries to be able to work more hours before having their benefits clawed back.\nBut without dramatically increasing the number of immigrants to this country, said Lefebvre, the restaurant industry expects its staffing problems will continue.\nHemant Bhagwani\u00a0concurs.\u00a0\"I cannot open a restaurant without hiring a foreign worker inside my kitchen, period.\"\nAs for Popa, his Burmese restaurant in waiting, Bhagwani will soon take matters into his own hands.\n\"I think it's time to open up so I will jump in myself and probably start cooking.\"\n"}, {"author": "Andrew Leach", "title": "OPINION | NDP climate plan tries (and fails) to carve out middle ground", "description": "The plan is riddled with inconsistencies and short on details", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ndp-climate-plan-andrew-leach-1.5276006", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279668.1568227578!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/jagmeet-canoe.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 13, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-09-13T11:00:00.355Z"], "source": null, "content": "Editor's note: This is the third in a series of articles from energy and environmental economist Andrew Leach\u00a0about the federal political parties' climate plans. Read his previous articles here:\nLet's be honest: who among us would not like to commute to work in a canoe?\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh looks like he's doing just that on the cover of the NDP's Power to Change website.\nThe website and the accompanying, more detailed climate plan both contain multiple, veiled references to the Green New Deal plan put forward by New York congressional Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and are meant to evoke the same types of emotion and symbolism.\nIt's even in the web address: climate and jobs. But will it deliver?\nThe NDP plan carves out a middle ground between commitments to policies that might meet Canada's 2030 target from the Liberals, and the wildly ambitious platform of the Green Party.\nSingh's plan, though, is riddled with inconsistencies and short on details and, where details are given, the policies simply aren't stringent enough to meet the goals.\nThe NDP Plan highlights nine areas for action, of which six are related to reducing emissions.\nIn addition to setting new emissions targets, the NDP proposes a program of job creation through clean energy adoption, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, energy efficiency retrofits for buildings, cleaner transit, subsidies for zero-emissions vehicles and more involvement of Indigenous peoples in climate action.\nThere are also commitments related to single-use plastics, climate adaptation and the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\nLet's start with their targets.\nWith all of the policies proposed to date by the governing Liberals, and notwithstanding potential reductions in the stringency of policies in Alberta and Ontario, we're on track for emissions of about 592 megatonnes (Mt) by 2030, well above our Paris target of 513 Mt.\nThe NDP plan sets a much deeper target.\nThey claim, with little evidence, that their policies will reduce our emissions to 450 Mt by 2030, and then add a statement that they plan to do more.\nThe monumental task of reducing national emissions by 38 per cent in 10 years is described as\u00a0\"an important first step,\" and they plan to add more measures to drive emissions down by a further 50 to 80 Mt, according to my calculations based on statements in the plan. We're just not told what those measures might be.\nHow is the NDP going to take this monumental first step? We're not told much about that either.\nThe plan states that the NDP will\u00a0\"continue carbon pricing, including rebates to households that fall under the federal backstop plan, while making it fairer and rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters.\"\nWe're not told what the carbon price will be, just that there will continue to be one.\nInterestingly, later in the plan, the NDP has its own breaks for big polluters, although they call them a \"Low Carbon Industrial Strategy\" which will include\u00a0\"a fund that industrial operators like manufacturers can apply to in order to access support for investments in lowering emissions and keeping jobs here in Canada.\" This will also be complemented with a $3-billion \"Climate Bank\" that would provide loans to spur investment in green technology.\nThe plan tells us that\u00a0\"workers most impacted by the changes in our economy will not pay the price of action on climate change.\"\nHere, they draw on the work of the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities, but managing a broad economic transition on the scale proposed by the NDP is an entirely different proposition than managing the impact of closing 14 coal power stations over 15 years. If you're not going to protect some of Canada's emissions-intensive sectors from competitiveness impacts, as the existing output-based-pricing system applied to industrial emissions does, you're talking about much more significant worker displacement still.\nWhat about oil and gas?\nFirst, the plan states that, \"where oil and gas will continue to form a part of Canada's energy mix in the immediate future, we will continue to prioritize domestic upgrading and refining instead of shipping our raw resources and jobs to other countries.\"\nDoes that mean new upgraders and refineries? Keeping the ones we have? Reducing production and export at the same time? If so, how? We're left to wonder.\nI was shocked that the plan doesn't even mention the oilsands, Canada's fastest-growing source of emissions, although it does mention bitumen once.\nThe plan also commits to eliminating oil and gas subsidies, claiming that\u00a0\"Canada spends $3.3 billion per year on oil and gas subsidies,\" and that\u00a0\"[the federal government] purchased the [Trans Mountain] oil pipeline for a staggering $4.5 billion,\" and that the government\u00a0\"gave another $1.6 billion in handouts to the oil patch.\"\nThese claims are worth unpacking because they're mostly smoke and mirrors.\nThe $3.3 billion number comes from a 2015 version of this IISD study, which is pretty dated when you consider how much has happened in oil and gas since then.\nThe up-to-date estimates from the same study group are smaller, with only about $380 million worth of federal subsidies on their list. Most of the subsidies in the original and up-to-date studies are attributed to Alberta and B.C. government policies: resource royalties, taxes, research grants and the like.\nIf Singh thinks the federal government can affect these policies, Sections 92 and 92A of the Constitution might have something to say about it.\nWhat about the $1.6 billion in \"handouts\"? That's where it gets interesting.\nThese were funds announced last year to, among other things, support investments in green technology and environmental efficiency. In other words, the same types of investments envisioned by the NDP's own proposed multi-billion-dollar Climate Bank and Low Carbon Industrial Strategy.\nAre we to understand that the NDP would not allocate any of these dollars to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector? Or that similar investments made by the NDP would not count as subsidies or handouts for some reason?\nAs for Trans Mountain, the government did buy the pipeline for $4.5 billion, but this can't be seen as a direct subsidy, since the government also received a valuable asset in return.\nArguably, the pipeline expansion would not have been underwritten by any private sector company, but even so, the lion's share of the purchase price was not for the expansion but for the existing pipeline.\nInterestingly, the plan doesn't say what an NDP government would do with the pipeline, although presumably divestiture or outright cancellation would be on the list.\nIt's not clear in the plan how much the NDP expects these reductions in so-called subsidies to reduce emissions. What's certainly clear is that there are not billions of dollars worth of new dollars available to the federal government if federal oil and gas tax expenditures and other programs are cancelled.\nThe rest of the NDP plan for emissions reduction centres on three key commitments to buildings, greening transit and personal transportation and emissions-free electricity.\nThe NDP sets a target of retrofitting all housing stock in Canada by 2050, with half of these retrofits completed by 2030.\nHalf the homes in the country getting some sort of improvement by 2030 is ambitious in and of itself, but we're only told that\u00a0\"homeowners would be able to access low-interest loans repayable through energy savings to cover upgrades like insulation, windows, heat pumps, and other renewable technologies.\"\nInterest rates are already very low, so you're going to have to do a lot more than offer a low-interest loan (which would still likely have a higher rate than a mortgage or home-equity-secured line of credit) to get people to do a lot of things they would not already do to reduce emissions.\nOn electricity, the NDP will set\u00a0\"a target to power Canada with net carbon-free electricity by 2030, and move to 100 per cent non-emitting electricity by 2050.\"\nAs I wrote with the Green Party plan, this doesn't sound that ambitious at the national level, but regionally it's near-impossible.\nWe're not told much about the road from target to reality;\u00a0there's talk of the new Canadian Climate Bank, but new investment isn't the issue. If you're talking about a near-complete phase out of fossil fuel power in 10 years, you're going to need a big regulatory hammer or a much higher carbon price.\nAnd, supposing you were able to do that, you're going to need a massive increase in intertie capacity, storage and alternative, dispatchable electricity sources. Otherwise, it's going to be impossible to power many parts of the country when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.\nOn vehicles, the plan is also quite ambitious in goals, but without a lot of detail on policies. Where there are details, there are also concerns.\nThe plan promises federal purchase incentives and federal sales tax exemptions\u00a0\"for working families\" on zero-emission vehicle purchases. I'm not sure how that means testing is actually going to work.\u00a0Do retired people not qualify?\nThese federal incentives will grow in value to $15,000 and be targeted to made-in-Canada vehicles only.\nThis is, of course, likely to run afoul of our free trade agreements, while also being a very regressive and costly policy.\nWe know that, historically, a significant share of electric or hybrid vehicle subsidies have been paid to those who a) would have purchased EVs anyway (see here for a review of research by Gulati and Antweiler) and b) are in the higher end of the income distribution.\nIf you walked into an NDP policy convention and pitched a policy that would hand out $15,000 cheques, predominantly to the most well-off households, and nothing to those who can't afford to buy a new car, how well do you think that policy would go over? Somehow, subsidies for electric vehicles always seem to escape that same type of scrutiny.\nTransportation and transit is the biggest line item in the plan at $6.5 billion, but when you consider that we have more than\u00a020-million light-duty vehicles on the roads in Canada, you're going to need a lot more than that to drive a large-scale conversion of Canada's fleet on subsidies alone, without additional regulations or, again, carbon prices.\nI was deeply critical of the Green Plan for pitching outcomes that, in many cases, were technically infeasible and of the Conservative Plan for promising more reductions from demonstrably weakened and/or undefined policies. The NDP fits in the middle of those two.\nThey offer targets which are, for the most part, at least technically feasible, but they don't offer the policy horsepower to get there.\nMany of the policies they do identify might be popular, but they simply won't generate the levels of emissions reductions promised.\nThis column is an opinion.

All were presented with the same questions.\u00a0Clicking the candidate's name above will take you to their survey responses. The candidates were told they had a 200-word limit for answers.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nTrust is the most important consideration facing residents of Perth\u2013Wellington in this election. Voters should consider two equally important questions.\nFirst, we must ask which leader, and which party, should we trust to take on serious national challenges.\u00a0Who do we trust to help make it possible for all of us to get ahead? Who do we trust to budget responsibly? Who do we trust to be a leader the world can take seriously?\nSecond, we must ask which local candidate has shown the ability to represent our values and capably serve our community. Which candidate do we trust to be accessible when we need them most? Which candidate has the experience we need to represent every community in Perth\u2013Wellington?\nTo earn voters' trust, I will continue doing what I have always done over the last four years: serving people to the best of my ability.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you return as the MP?\u00a0\nOver the last four years, we've been paying more for gasoline, home heating, hydro, housing, and much more. We must address the rising cost of living. As an MP, I would do what the Liberals did not do: I would oppose any measure that does not respect this reality facing too many Canadians.\nWe can start by trusting people with their own money. With the Conservatives' universal tax cut, the average Canadian family will save over $850 per year.\nAlso in our plan: tax credits for children's fitness and arts programs; tax-free maternity benefits; increasing the age credit for seniors by $1,000; and removing the federal tax on home heating.\nWe would also introduce four new measures to make it easier for first-time home buyers to buy a home.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nClimate change is real and requires immediate action. Andrew Scheer's plan would require the biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions or invest in new green technologies.\nIt is also a global problem requiring global solutions. For that, we must restore Canadian leadership on the world stage. We need a prime minister the world will take seriously.\nImposing additional taxes on people in our riding \u2014 who may have no choice but to drive to work or transport their crops to elevators \u2014 will make no meaningful difference in reducing emissions. It will just make life even more expensive.\nYou can read the Conservative plan for the environment at the website arealplan.ca.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nRaised on our family's farm near Mitchell, I learned early the importance of hard work. I believe in public service and our capacity to build strong, healthy communities\u00a0and a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I'm running to serve every person in every corner of Perth\u2013Wellington.\nService means representing our values and interests. That's what motivated me to introduce a bill to protect young people and those with disabilities from exploitation.\nIt's also why I have championed rural communities, stood up for local small businesses\u00a0and challenged the government to respect the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system.\nI'm running because I know we can build a country that future generations will be proud to inherit. I will continue to be accessible to every constituent, no matter where they live, whether one-on-one or at community events. I ask for your support to continue serving everyone in Perth\u2013Wellington.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nSustainability is the top issue facing Perth-Wellington. I will work to ensure that life in Perth-Wellington is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to find solutions that are good for both the environment and the economy. The Liberal climate action plan is both ambitious and realistic. It includes innovation, research, clean technology, and putting a price on pollution. I am proud to support the Liberal plan that is committed to encouraging lower greenhouse gas emissions without putting a financial burden on households.\nWhen the Ford government cancelled Ontario's successful cap and trade system, the federal government implemented a carbon price (so-called \"carbon tax\") and a corresponding rebate called the climate action incentive payment.\u00a0\nLiberals value the small businesses in rural communities that create good jobs and the farmers that feed Canada and the world. We will help our family farms stay strong, help connect rural communities with high-speed internet, and continue to make rural success a priority with a dedicated minister of rural economic development.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Perth-Wellington candidates on environment, cost of living and top issues in this election", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/perth-wellington-federal-election-candidate-survey-1.5313132", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315794.1570677080!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/candidates-in-perth-wellington.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 13, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-13T09:00:00.823Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Voters will head to the polls on Oct. 21 and in Perth-Wellington, people will have a choice between six candidates.\nThe candidates in Perth-Wellington are:\u00a0\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has asked the candidates to answer a survey.

It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014\u00a0most were full time positions \u2014\u00a0and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low. Despite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living.\nA re-elected Liberal government will:\nCanada has the lowest debt to GDP ratio among G7 countries and this ratio has been reduced each year we've been in office. That means we will have the capacity in whatever economic situation to deal with that situation appropriately. To keep our economy strong and growing, we will also move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe've seen the impact of climate change, with floods and fires destroying entire communities in Canada. Our children are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up.\nThe Liberal plan isn't perfect, but it is both ambitious and feasible. Progress has already been made \u2014 putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics. Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30 per cent\u00a0by 2030 and Liberals are committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out.\u00a0\nA re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. We are committed to moving Canada forward \u2014 building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nPublic service means working to create a better community and country for our children and grandchildren \u2014 that is what motivates me to become the MP for Perth-Wellington. I will work to improve the environment, reduce the cost of living, and strengthen social services.\nMy varied work experience includes hosting a children's talent program on CFPL-TV in London; teaching special education students with the Thames Valley District School Board; and ministering to United Church congregations in St. Marys, Stratford, and Palmerston. My wife Ruth and I are residents of St. Marys; we have five children and three grandchildren.\nAs a former town councillor in Parkhill, I have political experience at the municipal level. I helped establish the London Convention Centre and was an early supporter of the Stratford Perth Rotary Hospice. I was a member of Stratford's Housing Committee looking for housing solutions for homeless people, and a co-organizer of St. Marys' Community Dinners.\nMy life's work has been focused on helping people in need. I will always stand up for the little guy. I know that public service is about addressing tough challenges, and I'm committed to continuing my work serving the citizens of Perth-Wellington at the federal level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nOne of the most important issues to citizens of Perth-Wellington is the climate emergency.\u00a0\nWe are keenly aware of the threat posed by climate change to the planet and our way of life. Extreme weather events like flooding, heavy rain, forest fires and intense hurricanes are seen across the country and we've felt the effects here in every part of the riding, both rural and urban. We have a number of active environmental groups such as Climate Momentum in Stratford, The Maitland Valley Carbon Footprint Initiative, and the City of Stratford itself has been a leader in a number of sustainability projects.\nI am inspired by the leadership of young people and was pleased to participate in the student-led climate action here in September.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first order of business would be to press for action on affordable housing. Many people in Perth-Wellington can't afford to wait for solutions to the housing crisis.\nWe need the federal government to get back to work building social and non-market housing and supporting co-ops. I would work with colleagues from all parties to expedite the funding and assistance needed for municipalities, co-ops or social enterprises to get projects off the ground.\nDealing with precarious employment is a priority for the NDP. As a member of the NDP caucus, I will support the party's re-institution of a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.\u00a0\nWe will work toward a living wage for all federally regulated workers which will set a standard for employers in every sector. We will give temporary and part-time workers access to the same compensation and benefits as their full-time counterparts.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe NDP knows that we don't have the luxury of time in taking action on climate change. On Day One, an NDP government would cancel the billions in fossil fuel subsidies as well as the Trans Mountain pipeline project.\nWe also stand firmly behind working people and will create 300,000 new jobs in our first mandate in the clean energy sector. Confronting climate change will require a massive mobilization of labour and resources to train and retrain Canadians.\nPriorities in a new energy economy include:\u00a0building a sustainable auto sector by manufacturing electric and zero-emission vehicles right here in Canada; retrofitting every home and public building by 2030 so that they are net zero ready; and expanding the availability of low-cost, zero-emission and accessible public transit.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have been a social activist and a member of the NDP for the past 17 years. I\u00a0grew up in Markham and have an honours degree in political science from the University of Guelph. I was a member of the board of the Guelph Campus Co-op for five years, as well as serving as president of both the federal and provincial Guelph NDP riding associations. While in Guelph, I was the host of Words and Music\u00a0on 93.3 CFRU FM.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am also a person living with cerebral palsy. As such I know what it is to face and overcome challenges. I also know what it is to confront inequality and succeed.\u00a0\nIn Stratford, I am on the executive of the Rotaract\u00a0Club and have been working on the 211 database through the United Way of Perth Huron. I am committed to building a society where human need comes before corporate greed.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nClimate change is the world's biggest issue, but locally we won't see major frequent impacts until it's too late.\u00a0\nWe need to act because our cumulative emissions will continue to act for decades. To meet our 2030 goals, we have work to do, and only the Green Party's plan meets those goals. The Liberal government (and the Conservatives before them) continue to support the oil and gas industry despite the fact that continued resource extraction at this level will hasten the onrushing climate catastrophe. In 2017, just to extract the oil and gas, 200 of Canada's 700 megatons of CO2 were emitted.\nWe cannot maintain the status quo policy and have a livable planet. The Green Party will declare a climate emergency, work with the other parties in an inner cabinet, cancel all fossil fuel subsidies, ban fracking, support the adoption of electric vehicles, bolster public transportation, replace coal and natural gas electricity generation, modernize and expand the national electric grid, complete a national building retrofit, switch to biodiesel, ban foreign oil imports, and restore natural carbon sinks such as the soil and forests. It is all possible, we just need the political and personal will to do it.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nLife is expensive, and wages haven't kept up with costs. People are worried about making sure their families have what they need to get by and be happy. The Green Party wants to help financially with the things that matter the most.\nWe plan to abolish tuition at post-secondary institutions, expand public transportation (low cost and electric), and mandate a livable minimum wage ($15/hr).\u00a0 We will limit credit card interest rates to 10% and encourage competition in the cellular phone and internet markets to lower costs for everyone.\nGood health is currently a luxury and it shouldn't be; poverty directly affects your ability to care for yourself properly.\u00a0 We are proposing a guaranteed livable income (GLI) to replace the patchwork of federal and provincial programs that assist people who cannot work or are in low income situations. To pay for these programs, we will close tax loop holes used by the very wealthy and large corporations, so that they pay their fair share.\u00a0 Tax breaks for huge corporations don't help everyday people.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe climate crisis is the most important issue for Canadians, whether they realize it or not.\u00a0 The climate crisis requires a concerted effort at all levels of government and grass roots action by everyone.\u00a0\nFor the government to act in the long term best interest of the people of Canada, we need increased transparency and accountability.\u00a0The oil and gas industry is the largest source of emissions in Canada. The federal government needs to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and put those funds into environmentally sound energy.\u00a0\nThe Transmountain Pipeline expansion should be stopped. The BC Liquid Natural Gas project should be stopped. We need to transition to 100% renewable energy sources. We need to do what is best of the health of our population and planet, not what makes the fossil fuel industry the most money.\u00a0\nThe argument that it is either\u00a0the economy or the environment is invalid, as there are more jobs in a renewable and sustainable economy (estimated 3 times\u00a0more). Corporate influence must be removed from politics and the science must be respected.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a doctor and anesthesiologist. I've put my practice on hold to run for office\u00a0because I think climate change is the most important issue facing the country.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce I read the IPCC\u00a0(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate report last fall, I knew I had to get involved.\u00a0\nAt my regular job, I deal with sick people in complex situations as part of my routine work.\u00a0 For most people that would be stressful. After examining the evidence for climate change, I was losing sleep thinking about ways to change my personal environmental footprint.\u00a0 We need to make changes at the federal level because they control the sectors where the largest emissions occur.\nI got involved to try and make the changes we need to keep our planet in a livable condition.\u00a0The Green Party is the only political party with the ethics and conviction to stand up to the old parties and corporations, to get things done.\nI'm doing this so we have the best chance to maintain a livable planet, so my kids have a chance at a reasonable existence.\u00a0To not act given the current evidence will be disastrous, and future generations won't understand why we seemingly chose self-destruction because it was more convenient than change.\nFacebook page\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nHealth care is top of mind. Although this is a provincial responsibility, we can see that wait times and quality of care have been long time concerns without question. No one has been able to assist with changing this.\nThe People's Party of Canada understands that one of the issues here is that provinces have had an unreliable source of federal funding year to year, making it difficult for them to plan and deliver the necessary services. Ottawa's health care transfers to the provinces have doubled since 2006 from $20 billion to $40 billion this year with nothing to show for it.\nWe will give up the GST, which is expected to be around $40 billion and send it to the provinces each year in order to stabilize health care funding. Ottawa will stop meddling in health care\u00a0and allow the provinces to be fully responsible for delivery of this service as the Constitution states.\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nPersonally, I will stand up as the MP for Perth-Wellington and speak out for what the residents of this riding need. Our party policies are extremely helpful in this regard.\nTo assist with the cost of living we will abolish the carbon tax, which is going to impact the cost of everything that we need from groceries to shelter and etc, and replace the tax with nothing.\nWe will simplify the income tax system by raising the personal exemption to $15,000, charging only 15% tax from $15,001 to $100,000,\u00a0and charging 25% for $100,001 and over. This will help the more vulnerable while assuring that more fortunate citizens will pay their fair share of tax.\nWe will end supply management which will allow Canadians to access nutritious food at a reasonable price. To assist the Canadian economy, one step is to ensure that pipelines get built by using the Constitutional laws and we will do that.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change has always happened, thankfully, as we could not live here in Perth-Wellington without it. Twelve thousand years ago, this area was under ice and the earth warmed up. It did not warm up due to human activity.\nWe do not believe that there is a climate emergency. Due to the fact that there is no scientific consensus on this issue, we will not invoke costly taxes that will hurt our prosperity. Until such time, if ever, there is clear consensus, our approach to climate change will be to assist those most vulnerable to flooding and other natural disasters.\nWe do believe in a clean environment and all of us need to assist with that each day, we can all do our part. What will you do? Give up single-use plastics? Walk and bicycle more? Stop burning large amounts of fossil fuels on personal vacations? Will you drink municipal tap water? Will you plant trees? Will you conserve electricity? All of these actions will help us build a cleaner environment.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI am a lifelong resident of Perth County, having grown up on a dairy farm. I built a successful tool and die business in Stratford and retired financially independent at the age of 38. I ran as an independent candidate in this riding in 2015.\nI am thrilled to be part of this grassroots movement, the People's Party of Canada, whose policies I align with. I stand for fiscal responsibility and a vibrant Canadian economy. I stand for secure Canadian borders and our rights as a sovereign nation. We must uphold the rule of law and I believe in putting Canadians first.\nI believe we need to stop sending billions of dollars overseas for various reasons while so many Canadians, such as our veterans and etc., are experiencing difficulty making ends meet. I believe we need to stop or minimize UN funding. I believe in ending corporate welfare in Canada, a policy which only makes the wealthy\u00a0wealthier. I stand for a bold, new, proud Canadian future for all of us.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe national debt and interest payments of $70 million a day!\u00a0 We would treat the debt as a mortgage and begin paying it down.\nFamily breakdown is leading to a housing crisis and CHP CANADA would strengthen the traditional family unit by providing income to the parent, either or, who stays home to raise the children or care for disabled, elderly or others in their own home.\u00a0\nFibre [internet]\u00a0to the home is important and CHP Canada offers infrastructure loans to move this project forward.\nCHP Canada wants to maintain our borders, protect our sovereignty and slowly extend legal immigration to those most able to assimilate into our Canadian culture that was and still is, based on \"The Supremacy of God and the Rule of Law.\"\nOur Christian heritage protects the freedom of religion for all people while secularism and humanism would deny religious freedom to Christians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\u00a0\nCHP Canada would eliminate the income tax \u2014\u00a0completely freeing Canadians from the associated compliance costs. Replacing the income tax would be a fair tax\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a national sales tax on NEW goods only. This would allow both rich and poor to decide when to pay tax.\u00a0\nFor example, the rich buy a new car and pay a higher tax, the poor buy a used car and pay no tax. It will lead to economic advantages! Strengthen the traditional family unit and teach individuals how to manage money. Playing the game Cash Flow with my preteen grandchildren has taught them to get out of the rat race and avoid doodads.\nIt is a shame that the government preys on people's weakness by the get-rich quick scheme of the lottery.\u00a0 If five\u00a0per cent\u00a0is returned to the town, then, after expenses, big bucks left town for big business profits.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change, and associated alarmism, is a financial movement in favour of big business and increased control over people all around the world.\u00a0\nC02 is not a pollutant. Farmers buy it to put into their greenhouses to make the flowers grow. Farmers inject it into soil to beneficially create plant growth.\u00a0\nThe more C02 the better everything grows. Canada was once much greener than today as the fossil records show. We will adapt as changes are slow! CHP Canada would protect water, air and soil by fighting nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulates.\u00a0\nOf greater concern is Canada's moral environment which is creating family breakdown.\u00a0The porn industry is harming everyone's ability to maintain strong family ties ... The lack of respect for life, from the not-yet born human beings who are not granted human rights, to the elderly and disabled who may be coerced to assisted suicide because of their life's circumstances. The moral compass of our nation is eroding leading to a weak and vulnerable populace.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI am a farmer and small business owner with my husband. We raised four children to be healthy adults and have grandchildren.\u00a0I love to read and learn and I read legislation, court cases and alternative news sites. I like to garden and scrapbook and play with grandchildren.\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Tear gas, reports of woman shot after weekend protests in Iran: video", "description": "Demonstrators protest against Tehran's initial denial it shot down Ukrainian plane", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tear-gas-reports-of-woman-shot-after-weekend-protests-in-iran-video-1.5424585", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5424595.1578959797!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/iran-plane-crash.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 13, 2020 7:25 AM ET", "2020-01-14T00:02:40.307Z"], "source": null, "content": "Iranian security forces fired\u00a0live ammunition and tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the Islamic Republic's initial denial\u00a0it shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, online videos purported to show Monday.\nVideos sent to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran and later verified by The Associated Press show a crowd of demonstrators near Azadi, or Freedom, Square on Sunday night fleeing as a tear gas canister landed among them.\nPeople cough and sputter while trying to escape the fumes, with one woman calling out in Farsi: \"They fired tear gas at people!

It isn't for those weak of heart.\nLet's examine the complexity of creating a new neighbourhood from beginning to end, using Brookfield Residential's new community of Livingston at the northern edge of the city as a case study.\nLivingston is a new community launched in 2017 by Calgary-based developer, Brookfield Residential, located just north of Stoney Trail at Centre Street North.\nOnce it's fully built out over the next 15 years, it will be home to 30,000 Calgarians.\nIt is a mixed-use, transit-oriented community with plans for a town centre in the middle that will include two Green Line LRT stations, half-a-million square feet of retail and services, as well as a major employment hub.\nThe community was named after Sam Livingston, one of Calgary's first citizens, and many of the streets are named after early pioneers.\nBrookfield Residential was formed 60 years ago, as Carma Developers, when a group of 43 homebuilders came together at the Beacon Hotel on 16th Avenue at Centre Street North to discuss how best to collaborate with the city to build new neighbourhoods.\nIn the late 1950s, more than 1,000 people were moving to Calgary every month and houses couldn't be built fast enough.\nSince 1958, Brookfield Residential has created 64 new communities in Calgary, starting with Rosemont.\nThe developer's first step is to strategically analyze how, when and where the city will grow over the next 25 to 50 years, as well as how much residential land is already available and in what locations, as the city likes to have a 30-year supply of raw land.\nDevelopers have to predict where new neighbourhoods will be needed, based on research, experience and, yes, even their \"sixth sense.\"\nThey have to evaluate how any potential land fits with the province's Municipal Government Act, which governs how urban areas will grow, taking into account things like annexation, environmental issues, water rights and transportation infrastructure.\nThey must also consider the Municipal Development Plan, which is the City of Calgary's long-range road map for growth over the next 60 years, addressing areas such as density requirements, access to green spaces and diversity of housing types, as well as the need for commercial and institutional development.\nWhile some think it is the developer who decides on the density and diversity of the housing and the shape of new neighbourhoods, it is the City of Calgary that has the most influence.\n\"Every five years, we take a really hard look at every bit of land in and around Calgary,\"\u00a0says Brendan McCashin, the senior development manager for Brookfield Residential.\n\"Is it serviceable? How does it match up with the City of Calgary's plans for growth? How can we make this a community where people will be proud to call home? We conduct detailed market analyses to determine what, if any, land we want to acquire. In Livingston's case, we looked at the regional context and started buying land in 1998 and completed the 1,260-acre acquisition from four landowners in 2004.\"\nThen the fun begins.\u2026\nOnce the developer has identified a piece of land to purchase, the negotiations begin with the landowner(s) to determine a fair price.\nThis is not as easy as one might think, as the developer faces a number of uncertainties. How long will it take for the city to grow to the point where the new neighbourhood will be needed? How long will it take to get approvals? How will the economy change over the 25 or so years it will take to get the new neighbourhood built? How will interest, taxes and other carrying costs change?\nIn Brookfield's case, the time it takes before the commencement of the development is the key determinant of the land value.\nDetermining that time-frame has become the biggest challenge in working with the city to bring a new neighbourhood to completion.\n\"You need to have the vision and financial capacity to look at a piece of farmland and say this land could become a thriving neighbourhood in 30 years, with the right plan to meet the needs of the next generation of home buyers and the city's ever-changing growth management strategies,\" says Ryan Boyd, Brookfield Residential's senior vice-president of communities.\nThe carrying costs begin.\u2026\nOnce the land is purchased, a vision must be created.\nConsiderations in creating a vision include the natural features of the land and how can they best be utilized, things like wetlands, escarpments, ravines and forested areas.\nWhat is the best access to the community from existing roads? How can transit best function? How many neighbourhoods will there be? Where should the schools, churches and emergency services go? What about commercial, industrial opportunities? And how does this all fit within the existing Regional Context Study.\nFrom 2007 to present, Brookfield Residential has undertaken a mega research program that included visiting numerous mixed-use neighbourhoods across North America, a trip with city transportation officials to Toronto to study its urban corridor initiative, as well as customer focus groups and market research.\nIn 2009, a design charrette was conducted with City of Calgary staff, consultants, school boards and other key informants to determine how to create a new community that would integrate residential, commercial, schools, parks and recreational amenities in the most synergistic manner to meet the needs of future generations.\nResearch indicated that the current north Centre Street neighbourhoods would attract a culturally diverse population, each with their own housing needs.\nAs a result of this research, Livingston's zoning allows for maximum flexibility for residential development to respond to market changes and allow for evolution as the community matures.\nIt includes everything from townhomes to single-family homes, from secondary suites to low-rise residential near the town centre and even larger homes at key sites.\nIt also resulted in a modified grid street network that enhances connectivity with multiple exits and entrances to the neighbourhood, and a design that capitalizes on the natural topography of the land, including parks at the top of the three hills and natural wetland areas.\nLivingston will have the density of an inner-city neighbourhood like Hillhurst-Sunnyside, with its own main street and two LRT stations.\n(End of Part 1.

No doubt, the rising cost of housing and the parallel rise in the cost of living are behind a growing number of Canadians who are considering innovative co-ownership arrangements as a way to pool both financial and social resources, at least in part.\u00a0\nOne such arrangement is a multi-generational household, which houses three or more generations of one family. According to Statistics Canada and the Vanier Institute of the Family, it was the fastest-growing type of household in Canada between 2001 and 2016.\u00a0\nJason Davenport, a branch manager for Meridian Credit Union in Toronto, says larger mortgages are driving the need for sharing financial resources. Meridian is one of a handful of lenders, including Vancity and DUCA Credit Union, that facilitate having multiple people on the title of a home. \"I would say it's more a niche than a trend, but there is this requirement for these sort of products now certainly in places like the GTA,\" says Davenport, who has seen the number of people choosing Meridian's friends and family mortgage increase in his five years with the company.\u00a0\nMulti-generational living isn't new in Canada (it was even more common before the Second World War than it is today). In fact, the term might immediately conjure images of the in-law suite, created expressly to house an aging parent. But the in-law suite is only one setup for multi-generational living, and the motivations for choosing a multi-generational living situation can vary greatly.\u00a0\nSome are designing their multi-generational households in a less conventional way to suit varying lifestyle needs and pursuits, and to care for all. Such is the case for Sarra Tang and Lulu Phongmany. We spoke to them about why they chose multi-generational living, how they executed their visions and how it has impacted their day-to-day.\u00a0\nSarra Tang is the founder of Hoi Bo, a Toronto-based sustainable clothing and accessories brand. Hoi Bo is set to open a new flagship store and community space in Toronto's west end \u2014 on the ground floor of Tang's home.\u00a0\nSarra Tang bought her semi-detached, 1,800-square-foot home in the early 2010s. She moved in with her son and partner, with the idea of undertaking a renovation, in stages, to the living space and to turn main floor into a retail space for her business. But shortly after they took possession, Tang's sister moved in, and the family realized the renovations would be better achieved in one go.\nThat's when they made the decision was made to move everyone into Tang's mother's house while they undertook the larger, full-scale renovation, which would involve adding another floor and engineering balconies that could double as spaces to grow their own vegetables.\u00a0\nAs well as the ground-floor flagship retail space for Hoi Bo, the home's interior will consist of a communal living area and kitchen, plus four studio-style apartments that will give each family member their own private space within the larger home. The rooms will vary in size from 230 to 280 square feet, and each will have its own three-piece bathroom. When construction is complete, they plan to sell Tang's mother's home.\u00a0\n\"What the project was really about for our family was how it is that we are all supporting each other,\" says Tang. She adds that she envisioned the space as one that would give each family member the flexibility to pursue their interests \u2014 something that might not be possible if they were each responsible for their own individual dwellings.\n\"We were able to pool our resources together to make sure that no one person was over-burdened financially, which was really important to health and wellness \u2026 it was really about setting up an ecosystem for our lives that really was self-sustaining.\"\u00a0\nThis flexibility means, for example, that Tang's mother can be freed of housekeeping responsibilities. It also means that Tang's 24-year-old-son can be spared the full blow of Toronto's crippling rental prices. While every family member is contributing to financing the project, they also contribute to the household in other ways. For her part, Tang enjoys being the cook for the family.\u00a0\nTang's philosophy of living sustainably is one that carries through all aspects of her life, from Hoi Bo to this new living space to the design of the home's long driveway, which is slated to become a green space open to the community, with market stalls for small business and emerging artists.\u00a0\nWhile the design and renovation process to date has not been without its challenges\u2060 \u2014 Tang says she has learned a lot about \"working with other people and communicating and managing expectations\u2060\"\u2060 \u2014 she credits her family for being \"enormously supportive\" throughout the process.\u00a0\n\"I think that it's such an amazing gift that immigrants bring to Canada \u2014 this different perspective and these different ideas on how it is that you can approach life and how you can support each other as a family,\" says Tang. \"It doesn't have to just apply to family members. It can apply to friends as well.\"\u00a0\nTang says that she doesn't consider her family remarkably close in the way people might expect \u2014 nor does she consider that a necessity to sustain this type of living arrangement.\n\"I think what is essential is to come at the project with people who are open-minded,\" says Tang. She hopes her example can help change the narrative around who can afford to own a home, and how, despite complex issues of affordability.\u00a0\n\"I'm optimistic that people will reimagine a different approach to homeownership. Toronto is ripe and ready for real change, and I look forward to seeing the creative approaches that people come up with to tackle the problem.\"\nLulu Phongmany is a growth consultant based in Vancouver. The Phongmany family made the decision to design and live together in a home with three distinct spaces.\nLulu Phongmany lives with her father, sister, brother-in-law and two nephews in a custom-built home and says that while multi-generational living was uncommon among people she knew growing up, it was \"not an unusual concept\" to her.\u00a0\n\"This might be a trend to other people, but it's not a trend to us. This was something that was inevitable, and we see it all the time. \"\nPhongmany and her sister always knew that they would eventually end up caring for their parents in their old age, but didn't know what form that care would take. When their mother passed away, the family decided to give up their individual dwellings in favour of finding a space that could work for them all.\u00a0\u00a0\nPhongmany says deciding to live together wasn't a matter of saving money or pooling financial resources to get something that was otherwise unattainable.\u00a0\n\"It wasn't less money to do this, and it definitely took a lot of time,\" she says. \"The biggest thing was that we wanted to be together. That was the core motivator of this project.\"\nThough they weren't originally interested in taking on such a large endeavour, they were unable to find an existing home that fit their needs. Ultimately, the family decided to purchase a property in their preferred neighbourhood and built a five-bedroom, three-bathroom main house for her sister's family, with a two-bedroom basement apartment for Phongmany and a one-bedroom laneway house for her father.\u00a0\nPhongmany's work takes her away from Vancouver often, and she was living abroad when the home was completed, which is how she ended up living in the spare bedroom in the main house. She plans to move into the basement when the current tenants vacate.\u00a0\n\"The idea was that we would always have space to be separated with \u2026 the three different spaces, but [that we could] also be together in one place,\" says Phongmany. The family worked with an architect to design a home in which they could live communally.\u00a0\nThe situation lends itself to evolution in the future, depending on how the family's needs change, for example, if her nephews want to move into the basement when they're older. It also offers them convenience now. Phongmany and her father can provide childcare for her nephews during the evenings and days respectively, and the family members take turns providing dinner.\u00a0\n\"It's a joy when everyone comes home. We have family dinners together almost every night,\" says Phongmany. She remembers feeling jealous of the time her family was spending together when the home was first completed and she was still living abroad, saying that living in a large city alone can feel lonely and superficial.\nThe design of the home, which contains both private and communal space, has helped her adjust after living alone for 18 years.\u00a0\n\"This concept that you can't have your individual time when you live with your family, I think needs to be revisited \u2026 I think if people understood that you can do both, they would probably be more open to this.\"\u00a0\nPhongmany says that while they've all benefited financially from access to more disposable income and flexibility to travel since living together, it's the generosity their new living situation has reintroduced to their lives that is most notable.\n\"The one thing that I think it brings out in you, when you live this way, is that it really makes you much more generous. Our parents were always really generous with their home, in the sense that if anyone needed a place to stay, they were always the first people to offer it,\" she says, adding that that generosity of space was not as prevalent when they all lived independently. At the moment, they also have a cousin staying with them.\n\"I just feel more connected to not just my immediate family but my extended family.\"\nEva Voinigescu\u00a0is a freelance journalist and producer.

The same day, the Ford government signalled its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nKeith Brooks, program director at Environmental Defence \u2014\u00a0which was an intervenor at the Court of Appeal hearing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0said Tuesday with the election over, \"it's time\" for Ford to \"drop the carbon pricing challenge.\n\"The premier said the people would\u00a0decide the fate of the federal carbon price, and they have voted to keep it in place,\" Brooks told CBC Toronto in an email statement.\n\"Although a majority of Canadians didn't vote for one party, over 60 per cent voted for a party that is committed to fighting climate change and supports the carbon pricing\u00a0system currently in place.\"\nBrooks urged the province to instead focus on efforts to fight climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A recent report issued by the organization said\u00a0the Ford government\u00a0has done almost\u00a0nothing on the bulk of the promises in the greenhouse-gas reduction\u00a0plan it introduced last November.\n\"Ontario needs to stop wasting our tax dollars \u2014\u00a0and time we don't have \u2014\u00a0fighting the federal government's carbon price,\" Brooks said.\nGreen Party of Ontario leader\u00a0Mike Schreiner\u00a0similarly called on Ford to drop the province's lawsuit.\u00a0\n\"[Ford] should drop the campaign to sabotage climate solutions and start showing Ontarians that he actually understands the urgency of the climate crisis,\" Schreiner said in a statement.\nIf the Premier is truly interested in fixing past mistakes, this is the next reset button he should push.\"\nThe federal carbon pricing law applies to Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, all of which do not have their own carbon pricing schemes.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThere are several topics that I could bring up, but they all fall under one broad tent: their future. People are worried about their economic future, the future of the environment, and the future of Canada on the world stage.\nThe cost of living is rising faster than wages, Canada's emissions are growing at record rates, and Canadians are concerned that Canada's reputation has diminished on the world stage after four years under Justin Trudeau's leadership.\nA Conservative government will live within it's means, lower taxes for middle class Canadians, and make investments in our children. On the environment, rather than punish Canadians with a carbon tax for commuting to work and driving their kids to hockey practice, we will\u00a0incentivize\u00a0environmentally-friendly home renovations, and local green technology.\u00a0\nLastly, a Conservative government will reinvigorate Canada's role in the alliances we share with our democratic allies. This includes existing alliances like NORAD, NATO, CANZUK, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie, and the Five Eyes, but it will also include greater overtures to India and Japan.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nOver the past four years under Justin Trudeau, nearly 50 per cent of all Canadians are within $200 of insolvency every month. Because of their hard work, Canadians are able to get by, but many aren't able to get ahead. That's why a Conservative government, under the leadership of Andrew Scheer, will put you first and make decisions to help you get ahead.\nWe have introduced several measures to put money back into your pocket.\u00a0The universal tax cut will give the average Canadian family over $800 more per year to spend on home renovations, a trip or put into savings. The child fitness and arts tax credits will save Canadians 15 per cent of the total cost of those programs and activities. The transit tax credit will reduce the overall cost of your monthly transit pass; a cost saving measure that was cancelled by the Liberal government.\nKitchener-Conestoga residents are eager to see the removal of GST from home heating costs. When it's 30 below you shouldn't have to decide between putting food on your table or heating your home! That's why we will remove tax on those bills, leaving you more money at the end of each month.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nOur Conservative Party's comprehensive plan for the environment is built on three guiding principles:\nGreen technology, not taxes.\nA cleaner and greener natural environment.\nTaking the climate change fight global.\nThe full plan can be found at\u00a0arealplan.ca. One key issue that I feel very strongly about is our plan to protect our waterways against wastewater dumping. We will work with municipalities to end their practice of dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into our waterways.\nWe will also reinstate funding for wetland, watershed, and fisheries conservation that was revoked by the Liberals.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm a proud husband, father, and grandfather and I have been privileged to serve Kitchener-Conestoga as your Member of Parliament for the past 13 years.\nI want to continue to serve in this capacity because I love our region and the people who live here! Kitchener, Wellesley, Wilmot, and Woolwich all have a special place in my heart, and I believe I'm the best person for this job. Growing up on a farm in Wilmot Township and now living with my wife Darlene in Kitchener has given me perspective on how to represent both rural and urban constituents.\nOver the past 13 years, my office has helped hundreds, if not thousands of you deal with federal programs such as CRA, immigration, and other federal government related issues \u2014 and I hope to continue to serve you in this way for four more years.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nAffordability for families. Canada's economy is strong and growing, but the rising cost of living is making it harder for everyone to share in that success.\nFor too many families, it's still tough to make ends meet. Daycare spots are expensive and difficult to find, costing some families more than $4,000 this year. Meanwhile, parents who work late shifts or irregular hours have even fewer child care options.\nThat is why a re-elected Liberal government will give families up to $1,000 more through the Canada Child Benefit for kids under the age of one, make maternity and parental benefits tax-exempt and reduce childcare fees for before and after school care by 10%.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Liberal government's plan to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class is working. It helped Canadians create over one\u00a0million new jobs \u2014 most of which being full time positions \u2013 and brought the unemployment rate to a 40-year low.\nDespite that, many Canadians struggle to make ends meet given the high cost of living. That is why a re-elected Liberal government will work with telecom companies to lower the cost of wireless services by 25%, increase Old Age Security by 10% once they turn 75 and ensure middle class Canadians pay no federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn, saving the average family $585 in taxes each year.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nClimate change represents an existential threat and Canadians are taking to the streets to demand stronger action to fight it. That is why the Liberal government is phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics and put a price on pollution.\nA re-elected Liberal government has committed to getting Canada to net-zero emission by 2050, make Canada a world leader in clean technology, protect 25% of Canada's lands and oceans by 2025, help homeowners and landlords retrofit their homes to make them more energy efficient and plant 2 billion trees.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI never thought of entering politics when I decided to run in 2015, and only lost by 251 votes. Like many, I was frustrated by the direction of our country under the former government and felt that middle class families like my own were left behind.\nIn 2019, I decided to run again because the Liberal government has improved the lives of middle class Canadians, but we know there is more work that needs to be done. We need more people who are middle class in Parliament, advocating for our issues. I feel that not everyone's voice is being heard in Kitchener\u2013Conestoga. If elected I will represent all voices, not just people who share my beliefs.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nThe concern I hear most frequently from people in the riding, is about affordability, and health care. For many families, these two are closely connected, especially when there are members of the family who need chronic medication.\nThe inclusion of pharmacare as part of Medicare will offer tremendous relief to many families in Kitchener-Conestoga. Making dental care and vision care available to families who can't otherwise afford it, will not just address a financial need with families, but will also allow people to better participate in the workplace or in schools.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThere are a number of practical things that will offer relief, like pharmacare. Knowing the NDP has the support of two parties, this finally seems achievable.\nAnother expense that's crippling is the cost of daycare. Rather than tax credits, which only refund a small percentage (two to three per cent) of the actual cost, I will support the introduction of publicly funded daycare.\nWe need to have broader conversations about how our economy functions. While wages for more than half of the population are stagnant, the richest people are seeing disproportionate and exponential growth in income. Statistics Canada reports the average total income of Canadians in 2017 rose by 2.5 per cent, barely keeping pace with inflation. However, the average income of people in the top one percent grew by 8.5 per cent and the wealthiest group, those in the top 0.01 per cent, had an increase of a staggering 27.2 per cent.\nWe need to collectively figure out how to make sure every Canadian benefits from the growth of wealth. This will not be an overnight change, but we have to make sure that as we encourage a vibrant economy, it is vibrant for everybody.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe first thing I'd support is to stop proving taxpayers' money in the form of subsidies to fossil fuel companies, who are making billions of dollars in profits, and certainly do not need it.\nInstead of funding them, they need to chip in and fairly contribute to solving our climate problems. They not only played a large part in creating this crisis, but they have also benefited enormously off it. Green technology, and specifically the development of clean energy, is one of the fasted growing economies in the world, and China and other countries are taking full advantage of this. Canada needs to step up and take our rightful place on that field.\nWe have a lot of technology and innovation in this country, much of it in our own region, and we have all the potential we need to be the world leader in clean energy and technology. We have to focus our collective will and resources on this, so that we can be an exporter of clean energy and technology, rather than having to become dependent on other countries for the importation of our energy.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI refuse to settle. Just like workers are worth much more, so are Canadian voters.\u00a0\nI believe in the worth and value of people \u2014 as people, as workers, as people, as citizens. I believe we deserve better government, better healthcare, better educational opportunities, better wages, a clean, sustainable environment, and a bigger slice of the enormous wealth of our country, wealth that is currently concentrated in the hands of a few, and squirreled away in offshore bank accounts.\nIf the people of Kitchener-Conestoga choose to send me to represent them in Ottawa, that is what I will fight for.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\n\"Water is life. The Green Party's vision for our water is clear: keep it, conserve it, and protect it,\" said Elizabeth May. \"We will defend Canada's water from bulk exports, create a National Water Policy, and restore Canada's environmental laws to protect our waterways.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We really need to do more to expand natural ecosystems ... Our lives depend on being able to access clean drinking water and on restoring more of nature's filtration systems for providing drinking water,\" May says.\nThe Green Party will:\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nThe Green Party has three\u00a0priorities:\nIn 2017, 268,000 people were already employed in the clean energy sector. This does not include the 436,000 jobs in the energy efficiency sector & we have not yet begun a serious national retrofit of buildings and\u00a0industries. Projections put future jobs in energy efficiency retrofits alone at four million.\nGreen MPs will:\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nAccept, at every level of government, that climate is not an environmental issue. All parties will work together to ensure that the climate is no longer treated as a political football.\nEstablish a new target and file it as Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: 60 percent GHG reductions against 2005 levels by 2030; zero emissions by 2050.\nRestore funding of climate research within the Government of Canada.\nBy 2030, rebuild and revamp the east-west electricity grid to ensure that renewable energy can be transmitted from one province to another. Ensure all new cars are electric. By 2040, replace all internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles.\nCreate millions of new jobs in the trades by retrofitting every building in Canada \u2014 residential, commercial, and institutional.\nEngage every municipality and community organization, as well as every school and university to plant trees, install solar panels, heat pumps, assist in retrofitting buildings to maximize energy efficiency.\nInvest significant resources in adaptation measures to protect resource sectors such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. Map flood plains and other areas of natural vulnerability and adjust land-use plans accordingly.\nLaunch a global effort to restore carbon sinks.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nWith a strong desire to help build communities and people around her, Stephanie has worked tirelessly to promote a sense of community.\nIn 2007 she was hired by the Toronto Police Service and continued in this role until her first child was born. It was at this time that Stephanie decided to become an entrepreneur and work with small businesses and not-for-profits, who were passionate about increasing the health of local families.\nShe began to bring people and businesses together, from across multiple sectors and industries, to understand shared values and solve shared problems. Stephanie's father, Allan Beach, started his company when she was around two\u00a0years old. His work ethic and dedication to his job instilled in Stephanie the drive to keep building and expanding in business. Stephanie's two children have given her the reason to run for MP.\nShe knows that the future is unknown, but by electing honest and ethical people in politics, ones who understand we are stronger together, there is hope. We need to act now. We can not wait another four years. We already know our system is broken. Vote for what we need and want, not for what we fear.\u00a0\nWebsite\nResponses not yet received.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685683378", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2685683662", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Jorge Barrera", "title": "THC slushies, pirate radio and the cannabis-driven boom in a Mohawk community", "description": "Renovation and construction dot Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory in Ontario, much of it fuelled by marijuana", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/tyendinaga-cannabis-economy-boom-1.5216532", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5216581.1569608535!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tyendinaga-pot.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jul 21, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-07-21T08:00:00.714Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Driving down Highway 401 in southern Ontario, with the FM dial tuned to 87.9,\u00a0the 1990s-era rap music fades into an ad, offering a free joint with every purchase over $20 between midnight and 4:20 a.m. at the Pot Shoppe.\nA second ad then promotes a \"car show for Jeeps\" in the parking lot of the Pot Shoppe every Tuesday night.\n\"Don't forget, we have free coffee for the driver and our famous Pot Shoppe slushies at half-price for the passenger,\" the ad says. \"THC-infused slushies\u00a0\u2014 just a little more brain freeze.\"\nThe transmission tower for the station \u2014\u00a0Real Peoples Radio\u00a0\u2014\u00a0stands over a small shack that was once the second cannabis store to open in Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory,\u00a0located about 200 kilometres east of Toronto. That shack\u00a0is now the broadcasting studio for a\u00a0pirate radio station that lives on the edge of the radio dial,\u00a0and\u00a0also streams online.\nBehind the microphone is Joseph Owl, from Serpent River First Nation, Ont.,\u00a0a full-time DJ at the station who hosts the 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. show.\nOwl was offered the job through friends and started working at the station at the start of June.\n\"This is the best [employment] opportunity I've come across,\" he said.\nThe station is one of many offshoots from a cannabis-infused economic boom in this Mohawk community of 2,100, nestled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte, between Belleville and Kingston, and just a short drive from Prince Edward County, a growing tourism hotspot.\nThere are dozens of cannabis stores here \u2014 some estimates place the number between 40 and 50 \u2014 with names like Smoke Signals, Better Buds, Legacy 420, Peacemaker 420, Buddy's Dispensary, Fiddler's Green and Cannabis Convenience.\nCannabis plants sprout outside the front doors of some homes and hundreds more line the surrounding back lots and fields, for harvesting in late summer or early fall.\nThe community is dotted with renovation and construction projects, including several new gas stations and at least one new franchise restaurant.\nMuch of it is attributed to the influx of\u00a0cash coming from sales at local cannabis stores, then spreading throughout the community.\n\"It's a straight up economic\u00a0boom,\" said Jamie Kunkel, who owns one of the local shops, Smoke Signals.\nMoney was already coming into the community from outside customers looking for cheaper gas and cigarettes,\u00a0Kunkel said. But\u00a0the increased traffic from cannabis stores has\u00a0meant more revenue\u00a0for existing businesses.\n\"All the stores that existed prior to cannabis were all running\u00a0busy all day long, making good money,\" said Kunkel.\u00a0\"You get the big rush coming in from the cannabis, thousands of extra cars on a daily basis.... Now there's lineups for cigarettes, lineups for gas.\"\nKunkel said his\u00a0own cannabis business has grown exponentially since he began a little over three years ago. He was involved with a business partner and then branched out on his own, opening\u00a0a store out of his home before\u00a0constructing\u00a0a separate shop and eventually franchising\u00a0out to four other First Nations in Ontario.\nHe also bought the land adjacent to his storefront to run an annual Indigenous \"Cannabis Cup\" event;\u00a0hip-hop group Naughty by Nature performed this year.\nThe opening of Ontario's licensed cannabis shops in nearby cities like Kingston, Toronto and Ottawa \u2014 places where Tyendinaga draws the majority of its customers \u2014 has had some impact,\u00a0Kunkel said. But overall, business is steady.\n\"Our traffic went down, but our sales stayed the same or increased, because the traffic that we did keep were the bigger ones,\" said Kunkel.\u00a0\"They are coming in, they are buying ounces ... half-ounces, plus whatever else it is they want.\"\nKunkel said his prices are sometimes $10 less a gram for the same strain of marijuana sold at Ontario's regulated stores. \"[Customers]\u00a0don't want to go to those stores, they don't want to pay that much tax,\" he said.\nSusan and John Lovecchio, senior citizens from Brighton, Ont.,\u00a0about 60 kilometres west of Tyendinaga, said they shop at the Pot Shoppe because of the\u00a0service.\n\"They've been super ... they are a pleasure to work with,\" said Susan Lovecchio, who received a senior's discount of $24 and spent about $130 on cannabis products.\nLovecchio said she shops in Tyendinaga because there are no marijuana shops near her home. \"I think it's great. The Natives are wonderful and they're making the most of this.\u00a0And I say, 'Yeah, go for it.'\"\nA cannabis economy began to bloom in Tyendinaga after the Liberal government first announced it would legalize cannabis. By Oct.17, 2018\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the date of legalization\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roots of the cannabis industry had already sunk deep into the community.\nIt's all unfolded\u00a0outside of the federal, provincial and\u00a0territorial\u00a0regulatory framework.\nOttawa has said that federal and provincial cannabis laws would apply on reserves, but individual provinces and territories can make room for agreements with First Nations.\nAccording to the office of federal minister of border security and organized crime reduction, legal\u00a0cannabis can only be sold through government-regulated stores.\u00a0\n\"The only legal quality-controlled source of cannabis in Canada is through provincially or territorially authorized distributors and retailers or federally licensed\u00a0sellers that have the authorization of their health care practitioner to access cannabis for medical purposes,\" said Bill Blair's spokesperson, Marie-Emmanuelle Cadieux.\nOntario's Ministry of the Attorney General said in a statement that the province continues to \"engage First Nations\" who want to explore their own models for on-reserve cannabis sales. But, it said,\u00a0\"selling outside of Ontario's authorized retail system is illegal under federal and provincial law.\"\nOntario recently announced it will soon allocate 50 new cannabis retail licences\u00a0\u2014 including eight for First Nations on a first-come, first-served basis\u00a0\u2014\u00a0up from the\u00a025\u00a0licences handed out by the province earlier this year.\nAccording to Kunkel, there is little appetite in Tyendinaga to fall under federal and provincial rules and pay taxes,\u00a0even if a deal were struck with the band.\u00a0\nThe cannabis industry in the community is also a political statement, Kunkel said, a display of sovereignty from a people who never surrendered their rights to self-governance.\nThe Tyendinaga band council, known as the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte council,\u00a0passed an interim cannabis bylaw on Oct. 16, 2018, and began community consultations on a permanent bylaw, which are still ongoing.\u00a0\nThe council released the results of an online survey in April that was completed by 147 on-reserve band members. It\u00a0revealed divided opinions on the issue, with many leaning toward\u00a0stronger band control over the cannabis industry.\u00a0\nSome of the participants, though, questioned the survey's accuracy, noting that it could be filled out multiple times by the same person and said that the questions were skewed.\nSome voiced concern over the rise in prices driven by the booming cannabis economy, along with complaints over the increased traffic and safety concerns.\n\"The pot market has driven up the price of property, making the housing situation worse,\" said one respondent.\n\"There does not appear to be any control over who sells cannabis or where shops are set up. I can think of a thousand things I would like our reserve to be noted for, but one is not for having a cannabis shop on every corner,\" said another respondent.\nOthers said the industry was having a positive impact.\n\"The majority of these shops are employing a lot of community members that, without these shops, may be unemployed due to lack of transportation and job opportunities within our community,\" said a respondent.\u00a0\n\"With a few minor changes, I believe that the cannabis industry within our community can become something that will allow for our community to succeed,\" said another.\nThe Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte band council did not respond to an interview request.\nTess\u00a0Brant, a manager at the Pot Shoppe, said her\u00a0job in the cannabis field\u00a0\"has made a huge improvement\" in her\u00a0life, beyond just her finances. \"It's kept me on the straight and narrow,\" she said.\nBrant, a mother of four, is a recovering addict and took the job a little over a year ago after completing rehab.\n\"Being here, coming here, gave me a purpose,\" said Brant, noting she\u00a0no longer smokes marijuana and instead\u00a0uses CBD oil, a non-intoxicating\u00a0extract derived from the cannabis plant.\nBrant works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., running the store and handling the back end of the business, dealing with products and\u00a0choosing what to sell or what take a pass on.\u00a0\n\"I can afford a house, I can afford a car, I can afford for my kids,\" said Brant, whose\u00a024-year-old son also works at the store.\u00a0\"It's improved my life, 1,000\u00a0per cent.\"\nBrant said most customers come from Belleville, Kingston, Toronto, Ottawa and\u00a0Montreal; they even had a couple from Finland who stayed for a week to check out all the shops in the territory.\nBack at the studio of Real Peoples Radio, the speakers are thumping with hip-hop beats that fade as\u00a0Owl breaks in with the weather \u2014 in his own pirate-radio style.\u00a0\n\"It's gonna be hot, high of 28, humidex out\u00a0the roof.

That's about $400 million less than they borrowed during the previous quarter. Within that, the value of new mortgage debt increased by $700 million during the period, but that was offset by a reduction of more than $1 billion in other types of debt.\nIt's the growth of that second form of debt that has some observers concerned.\nNon-profit consumer advocacy group the Credit Counselling Society said in a release after the data came out that they \"continue to hear from Canadians\u00a0who are concerned [about]\u00a0how to make ends meet as their debt continues to grow.\"\nThe average debt load of an individual seeking the help of the CCS is\u00a0about $30,000 on top of any mortgage at the moment.\n\"This is alarming, as two decades ago, the average was $12,000 of non-mortgage debt,\" CCS\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Stacy Yanchuk Oleksy said.\u00a0\nBushmeneva said that the uptick in mortgage borrowing could be a sign that borrowers think the slowdown in the housing market may be over and that they are once again more willing to jump in.\n\"That being said, we do not expect the market to go back to its frothy\u00a0days, with gains in prices and home sales remaining relatively modest,\" she said.\nTotal debt loads are still inching\u00a0higher, but the good news is that so are\u00a0income levels. As such, a closely watched ratio of how much people owe compared to what they earn held steady.\nThe debt to disposable income level came in at 177.6 per cent during the quarter, the same level as it was at the end of 2018.

Sign up here\u00a0and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday.\nSyria's never-ending civil war threatens to boil over again, with renewed fighting and allegations of a fresh chemical weapons attack.\nLast night, the U.S. State Department said it is gathering information on a reported chlorine gas attack in rebel-controlled northwest Syria over the weekend, re-upping its warning to Bashir al-Assad's regime that \"the United States and our allies will respond quickly and appropriately\" to such war crimes.\nPrior chemical attacks in April 2018 and April 2017 were met with a barrage of missiles and bombs aimed at the Syrian military.\nThe State Department did not provide details of Sunday's alleged incident, but local media reports that four fighters with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group that was formerly allied with al-Qaeda, suffered injuries from gas munitions dropped by regime helicopters near the village of Kabana, in Latakia province. Doctors who treated the men say they were having difficulty breathing and complained of burning eyes, and smelled strongly of chlorine. There were no reports of civilian casualties.\nBoth the U.K. and France have joined the Americans in calling for further investigations.\nThe Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been probing the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict since 2013. Its latest fact-finding report, issued at the beginning of March, found that there were \"reasonable grounds\" to conclude that reactive chlorine gas was used against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7, 2018. At least 43 people died in that attack and more than 500 others were poisoned.\nThe OPCW doesn't apportion blame, but the U.S. government does.\n\"The Assad regime's culpability in horrific chemical weapons attacks is undeniable,\" Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokesperson, said yesterday.\nAnd she warned of \"false narratives\" and disinformation campaigns fed by the Syrian government and its Russian allies that seek to pin the blame for such incidents on opposition forces.\nThis all comes against the backdrop of a failing ceasefire in Idlib, the last remaining rebel-held region of the country.\nSince fighting flared up again in late April, more than 180,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Many are now camped out along the Turkish border, hoping to be allowed to cross into safety.\nToday, there are reports that opposition forces are on the offensive, retaking control of a village that Syrian government troops had captured on May 8, and launching rocket attacks against a nearby Russian airbase.\nThe U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports more than 1,150 air and artillery strikes over the past 24 hours and hundreds of deaths over the past three days, including at least 19 civilians. Shells also hit a Turkish military observation post.\nMore than two dozen schools and health care facilities in the region have been targeted over the past month.\nAlthough most of the country is now back under Assad's control, there is still no end in sight for the now eight-year-long civil conflict. But the price that average Syrians have paid for the power struggle is coming into sharper focus.\nYesterday, the Syria Justice and Accountability Center, an independent human rights organization, issued a report based on an examination of 5,000 seized Syrian government documents that detail how the Assad regime tried to crush the uprising.\nIt details orders to \"do the necessary\" to quell demonstrations, and an almost total disregard for the safety of civilians when the military planned attacks.\nThe documents also paint a picture of a state that jailed or disappeared its citizens on the slimmest of suspicions, from rumours of an intention to protest, to an overheard critical remark at a dinner party.\nAt least 14,000 people have died in Syrian prisons since the uprising began in March 2011, and 128,000 people have gone missing since being taken into custody.\nNigel Farage, a hot commodity in British politics at the moment, is under renewed scrutiny, London reporter Thomas Daigle writes.\nWhere there's smoke, is there fire?\nWhen it comes to political finances, Nigel Farage swears not.\nFarage, the longtime face of the U.K. Independence Party, now leads the red-hot Brexit Party. And just as his Brexiters appear poised to top tomorrow's European Parliament elections in Britain, the smoke of suspicion keeps blowing.\nIt began last week when Britain's Channel 4 reported that Brexit-supporting millionaire Arron Banks had funded Farage's lavish lifestyle \u2014 providing him with a Land Rover, a driver and a home in London's posh Chelsea neighbourhood \u2014 after Britain's 2016 EU referendum.\n\"Are you in fact a kept man?\" a reporter asked Farage on a campaign stop last week.\nFarage brushed aside the question and the controversy.\nLeave.EU, the Brexit campaign group co-founded by Banks, is under investigation after Britain's elections watchdog said it had grounds to \"suspect a number of criminal offences\" had been committed. Namely, the Electoral Commission says Banks may not have been the \"true source\" of millions of pounds in Brexit campaign funding, and has \"referred the matter to the National Crime Agency (NCA).\"\nAnd the European Parliament, of which Farage has been an elected member since 1999, says it will now probe the undeclared gift from Banks to see whether it broke any rules.\nIn the meantime, the Brexit Party has banned Channel 4 journalists from its events.\nAnd there's more smoke where that came from.\nThe Electoral Commission also showed up at Brexit Party offices yesterday to examine its fundraising practices.\nThis comes after former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed the party was accepting small \"undeclared, untraceable payments\" through PayPal.\nAt his last major rally before tomorrow's EU vote, Farage sought to ridicule the scrutiny of his personal and party finances. \"After seven hours today in the office, the Electoral Commission have not found a single misdeed by the Brexit Party,\" he said to thunderous applause from supporters at London's Olympia concert hall.\n\"Let's make it clear to the conspiracy theorists, to those who think somehow the Russians are funding us,\" Farage added, asking donors in the room to raise their hands as a way to show the party is funded by supporters.\nHe maintains the Brexit Party has managed to rake in donations of at least \u00a325 ($42 Cdn) from more than 100,000 supporters in less than two months.\nBritons head to the polls tomorrow, long before any inquiry determines whether claims of impropriety are founded. If there's any fire under all that smoke, voters won't know in time.\nA larger than life athlete.\nRaptors fans (and Snoop Dogg) flock to a Toronto sneaker store that put up a giant mural of Kawhi Leonard. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMoment?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheMoment</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hkj2Ko2D3Y\">pic.twitter.com/hkj2Ko2D3Y</a>\n\"Mr. Guajardo's [residence] is subsidized housing owned by the Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation, and his current employment is believed to be 'retired' and previous employment 'self-employed'.

The solution is not just changing the terms of financing.\u2026 The solution has to involve substantial federal new money as well.\"\nBut even with a significant contribution from the federal government, Crosbie said it still might not be enough to meet the province's target power rate of 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\"Now it's time for both the provincial and federal Liberals to come clean on what kind of help Ottawa's going to give us, and as well on where else we're going to find the money to make up this gap.\"\nNDP Leader Alison Coffin also says the provincial government could still be on the hook for a significant amount of money, despite help from Ottawa.\u00a0\n\"Even with the government of Canada jumping in with their $200 million \u2014 and we still don't know if they're going to do that for sure \u2014 we're still looking at a shortfall of about $200 million,\" she said.\n\"It does mean that we're going to be looking for more money somehow, or we're going to have to look at a way of being able to afford to go\u00a0to a slightly higher rate than 13.5 [cents per kilowatt-hour], which the Liberals had promised.\"\nCoffin said with the rate mitigation option laid out in the PUB's report, Ball's Liberals will still have to act swiftly to keep power rates from climbing.\n\"I think this is going to be the time for government to really step up and we'll get a good sense of if they are truly engaged and dedicated to keeping rates right,\" she said.\n\"The Liberal government has really been delaying a lot of decision making, so I have some concerns about the [reality] of the timeline.\u2026 This issue is really far too important to be delayed any longer.\"\nBoth leaders said if a rate mitigation plan isn't able to keep power costs from climbing, it would be devastating for ratepayers.\n\"If we have more increases \u2026 we have more and more money that we have to use for power out of a relatively fixed pot of income, then that extra money is going to have to come from somewhere,\" Coffin said.\n\"People are going to have to cut back on their groceries, or their leisure goods, or their housing, or their cars.\"\nCrosbie\u00a0echoed Coffin's concerns.\n\"Most people are at the edge of their budgets as things stand now, or beyond for that matter \u2014 how are they going to find the money to pay for a 75 per cent increase\u00a0in their power bills? It would flatten our economy.\"\nA spokesperson from the Department of Natural Resources told CBC News that officials were reviewing the report over the weekend before making comment Monday.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n"}, {"author": "Isaac Olson", "title": "'Our commercial streets are bleeding': City hears it's just too expensive to set up shop in Montreal", "description": "Charging tenants less to rent storefronts has proven to attract businesses, Montrealers tell city officials", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-vacant-storefronts-1.5431717", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5431779.1579303083!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/susan-usher.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 20, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-01-20T09:00:00.785Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Susan Usher first set down roots in Montreal's Mile End some three decades ago, the streets were calm, rental housing was abundant, and buildings, many fallen into disrepair, were cheap.\nBut she fell in love with the neighbourhood's\u00a0charm, and\u00a0to this day, she can't imagine living anywhere else.\u00a0\nIn 2002, Usher\u00a0invested in a three-storey, brick-faced building on St-Laurent Boulevard, with\u00a0a small retail space on the ground floor, two apartments above, and balconies wrapped in iron railings overlooking The Main.\nUsher has watched the neighbourhood evolve into an eclectic mix of chic eateries and boutiques that are slowly pushing out the mom-and-pops \u2014 the small grocers and shoe repair shops who can't afford the exorbitant rents that\u00a0corporate landlords are charging.\n\"We've lost some of the businesses that we were all really fond of,\" said Usher.\nTwo years ago, she decided to do something about it.\u00a0\nShe joined a neighbourhood committee that wants a thriving commercial scene in an affordable neighbourhood rich with urban essentials like bakeries, delis and d\u00e9panneurs rather than wall-to-wall businesses, like fancy restaurants and exclusive spas, that families in the area don't need.\nHer committee fears Mile End will become just as pockmarked with empty storefronts as\u00a0some of the city's hardest-hit commercial strips \u2014 a fear that's\u00a0shared by communities across Montreal.\nUsher was one of the first to speak last Tuesday, when Montreal opened\u00a0public consultations on the empty storefront problem.\u00a0\nWith the average retail vacancy rate hitting 15 per cent, and with some commercial streets\u00a0at nearly double\u00a0that, the city is eager to hear the public's ideas.\nSo far, two issues have come up time and again:\u00a0Montreal's steep commercial tax rate and the excessive rents property management firms are demanding.\nSuggestions include simplifying the way buildings are evaluated or offering educational classes to help business owners navigate taxes that feel\u00a0especially unfair to landlords like Usher, with her single storefront space.\nThe way the system works, she is in the same high tax bracket as corporate landlords.\n\"Our taxes have gone up from about $2,500 a year to more than $10,000 a year,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"The evaluation of our building has gone up 175 per cent between 2005 and today, whereas the amount of rent we charge in the commercial space has only gone up 35 per cent.\"\nThe Mile End committee's brief to the city last week suggested the city redefine those tax brackets.\nUsher suggested factoring in elements such as how long somebody has owned a building, or the original purchase price, to avoid placing individual owners like her in the same bracket as firms that are charging commercial tenants five times the rent that she charges.\nEither way, commercial taxes are out of control, according to Gopinath Jeyabalaratnam.\nJeyabalaratnam, an economic affairs adviser at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB),\u00a0told CBC's Let's Go that commercial taxes are\u00a0four times higher than residential taxes. As well, under the current model, those in high-value areas like downtown pay much more than those on the outskirts of the city.\n\"Our commercial streets are bleeding, and we have to stop the hemorrhaging because\u00a0otherwise, we might be putting a lot more effort and a lot more money to get back to a normal situation,\" he said.\nBut taxes aren't the only problem. Corporate landlords can afford to buy up bushels of buildings in an area, raise the rent and then wait for the next big franchise to move in. People like Usher can't afford to leave her commercial space\u00a0empty for months, so she charges less rent to keep her storefront occupied.\nHer tenant, Robert Sutcliffe, said he searched the neighbourhood for four months for an affordable place to open Art et Son, a shop specializing in retro home stereo systems.\nThe vacant commercial spaces owned by corporate landlords\u00a0would have cost him thousands more, so he felt lucky to discover Usher's storefront.\n\"This one fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for,\" he said. Still, he'd\u00a0like to see fewer vacancies on the street to attract more shoppers to the area.\nUsher is among those calling on the city to levy fines against landlords who leave commercial space empty.\nShe said those fines should be aimed at landlords\u00a0who have raised the rent more than 50 per cent\u00a0and have left a\u00a0space vacant for more than six months.\nMontreal architect Ron Rayside would also like to see landlords penalized for failing to fill vacancies because, he told the city commission, lowering\u00a0rents is a sure way to attract a tenant.\u00a0\nRayside, who owns a\u00a0couple of retail spaces himself, is a partner in a firm located on a commercial strip on Ontario Street East.\u00a0\nHe's always managed to keep his commercial space filled by keeping rents\u00a0low, he said. Once he even dropped the rent\u00a0down to a mere $100 per month, offering a local artist a short-term lease to help him get\u00a0his business off the ground.\nThe deal ensured the unit was maintained, secure and not just another vacancy in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, he said.\nThere are creative ways like that to keep retail space occupied if landlords are motivated to do so, Rayside said. And it might take penalties to create that motivation.\u00a0\nBut the city needs to do its part, as well, he said. He suggested more flexible zoning regulations that would allow property owners to be more creative with their properties.\nThe Montreal youth council made a similar suggestion, saying it would like to see empty storefronts put to use with temporary occupation permits.\n\"You could even have other, non-residential uses that are not commercial, per se, even temporary spaces \u2014 whether it be for artists or other uses,\" Rayside said.\n\"Once we decide from a social point of view and a commercial and city point of view\u00a0that vacant commercial spaces are really bad for the commercial artery or bad for the dynamic of a neighbourhood, then there are all kinds of different ways to solve it.\"\n"}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Liberals ask voters to 'choose forward' while Tories vow to help Canadians 'get ahead' in new campaign ads", "description": "Liberals, Tories launch TV ad campaigns ahead of Oct. 21 vote, NDP expected to follow next week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-tory-campaign-slogans-ad-1.5259889", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5260009.1566834827!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/campaign-ads.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 26, 2019 1:16 PM ET", "2019-08-26T17:33:41.194Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Conservative and Liberal teams have launched television ad campaigns ahead of October's federal election with a shared focus\u00a0on offering to make everyday life more affordable for Canadians.\nThe Liberal campaign slogan is\u00a0\"Choose Forward,\" while the Conservatives have gone with \"It's time for you to get ahead.\"\nThe NDP is expected to launch a slogan and TV ad campaign next week; a party spokesperson said the slogan will tell voters that the NDP is the only party that\u00a0\"will put people and their interests first.\" The Greens' slogan is\u00a0\"Not left. Not right. Forward together.\" The populist People's Party is going with \"Strong and free.\"\nJustin Trudeau is featured prominently in the Liberal ad, which shows the leader meeting with constituents in his diverse Montreal-area Papineau riding.\nOther shots show Trudeau riding public transit while speaking directly to camera about his government's accomplishments to date, specifically the \"middle class\" tax cut and an enhanced Canada Child Benefit for parents with young kids. He defends the government's climate plan \u2014 which includes a national carbon tax imposed on jurisdictions that don't have a plan of their own\u00a0\u2014 as the best way to fight an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\nTrudeau\u00a0doesn't mention by name his main opponent, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, but rather invokes former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper's legacy and takes a thinly veiled jab at Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford.\n\"I got into politics to help people like the people I've served here in Papineau for more than a decade, people who work hard to make ends meet, parents who want to build a better life for their kids, Canadians who want our country to stand for something positive in a world that's grown darker,\" Trudeau said.\n\"The Conservatives like to say they're 'for the people,' but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,\" Trudeau said, citing Ford's campaign slogan during the spring 2018 provincial election and a series of budgetary manoeuvres the Ford government has made to reduce a sizeable deficit in the country's largest province.\n\"In October we've got a choice to make \u2014 keep moving forward and build on the progress we've made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I'm for moving forward, for everyone,\" Trudeau said.\nAccording to the party, the ad is now airing on both conventional\u00a0television and digital platforms.\nTrudeau is expected to call an election sometime after Labour Day. Under federal fixed election date legislation, the vote must be held sometime on or before Oct. 21.\nThe Liberal slogan, Choose Forward, is similar to other Liberal campaign catchphrases from elections past\u00a0\u2014 especially to those deployed by governments trying to win re-election.\nIn the 2004 federal election campaign, Liberals opted for \"Moving Canada forward.\" The Ontario Liberals promised voters they were \"Moving forward, together\" in 2007 and then, in 2001, \"Forward. Together.\" (Former U.S. president Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign had a one-word slogan: \"Forward.\")\nThe Conservative ad features Scheer, dressed casually in a blue Oxford shirt,\u00a0speaking directly to camera and extolling the virtues of his plan to reduce taxes for Canadians.\nWhile he doesn't mention the carbon tax by name in the ad, Scheer\u00a0has said that one of his first\u00a0priorities in the event his party forms a government in the next Parliament would be to end the tax.\nScheer\u00a0also has promised to maintain the Liberals' enhanced Canada Child Benefit while introducing a new non-refundable tax credit that would make federal Employment Insurance (EI)\u00a0maternity and parental benefits tax-free. Under that plan, a person earning a salary of $50,000, who then goes on EI benefits after a birth, would save about $4,000.\n\"My plan for Canadians? Lower the cost of living and leave more money in your pockets,\" Scheer said. \"I believe Canadians across the country are so frustrated because they're working so hard and they're following all the rules, but they feel like they're falling further and further behind, or they're barely getting by.\n\"I have a plan to lower the cost of living to make life more affordable, to leave more money in the pockets of Canadians for their kids, for themselves or for your aging parents, because it's time for you to get ahead.\"\nScheer has said the Conservative campaign will be focused principally on affordability.\nWhen asked how he will appeal to young voters, Scheer\u00a0has said the Conservative Party has a plan to make the country's housing stock more affordable for millennial voters \u2014 many of whom are struggling to buy something in a time of sky-high real estate prices.\nA Conservative Party press release sent to reporters Monday said the campaign slogan reflects Scheer's positive conservative vision: \"A government that lives within its means and puts more money in your pockets so you can get ahead.\"\n\"We've seen who gets ahead under Trudeau. It's billion-dollar companies with high-priced lobbyists like Loblaws who get generous handouts from hard-working taxpayers. It's long-time corporate donors to the Liberal Party like SNC-Lavalin, who Trudeau broke the law trying to protect from criminal prosecution,\" Scheer said of the ad.\n\"Justin Trudeau has spent the last four years helping his political insiders get ahead. I think it's time for you to get ahead.\"\nThis isn't the first campaign-style ad to come\u00a0from the Conservative Party during the pre-campaign period. Over the spring and summer months, the party rolled out a series of attack ads targeted at Trudeau that say he simply isn't \"as advertised.\"\nDennis Matthews\u00a0is\u00a0a vice-president of marketing and communications at Enterprise\u00a0and a veteran campaign staffer who helped design ads for past Harper and Ford campaigns. He\u00a0said getting a slogan exactly right is hugely important to a campaign.\n\"A lot of work goes into crafting these slogans. There's a ton\u00a0of market research and focus groups. In the end they're to distil down the entire campaign. Every ad, every event, every speech, every press release, it all kind of boils down to your campaign slogan. It's something you really want rattling around in voter's heads when they're going in the ballot box,\" he said in an interview with CBC News Network.\n\"They're the embodiment of the entire campaign message for a team. They really have to get it right. And when you get it right, you'll remember them for years to come.\"\n"}, {"author": "John Last", "title": "Yellowknife's election ridings, by the numbers", "description": "Data reveals divides between electoral districts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-ridings-by-the-numbers-1.5282492", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283031.1568400587!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/composite-image-of-yellowknife-ridings.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 22, 2019 4:00 AM CT", "2019-09-22T10:00:00.363Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Who are your fellow constituents?\nCensus data collected by Statistics Canada and matched to Yellowknife's seven territorial ridings by the N.W.T.

Here are the most interesting things we found.\nYellowknife's largest riding by population is Yellowknife North, which encompasses the neighbourhoods of Old Town and Niven Lake, part of downtown, and houses along the Ingraham Trail.\nDespite boasting many of the city's oldest structures, the district has actually seen the most new building of any area. Almost half of the houses built in the last 10 years have been built in Yellowknife North \u2014 more than 260 of them.\nParadoxically, Yellowknife North also has the most long-term residents of any district. More than 87 per cent have lived in Yellowknife more than five years. Those residents also tend to be high-earning. One in four of the city's top earners \u2014 people who take home more than $100,000 per year \u2014 live in the district.\nAlmost a third of the city's entrepreneurs call Yellowknife North home, but the district's single biggest voting bloc by employment is public employees, who\u00a0also account for a third of the population. It's also the city's brainiest district \u2014 three quarters of residents over 25 have some form of post-secondary degree.\nIt may not be a surprise, then, that Yellowknife North is also the city's most bilingual district, where 22 per cent of residents reported speaking both of Canada's official languages.\nIt shares its Frenchiness with Yellowknife South, with the two districts dividing most of the 55 people who reported French as their only language between them.\nLike Yellowknife North, Yellowknife South is home to high earners. There aren't many households reporting an income near or below Alternative North's estimated living wage of around $45,000 per year \u2014 census data says only nine houses earn $49,000 or less.\nThe district is also home to the city's biggest houses, where 44 per cent have eight or more rooms. That extra room is needed \u2014 41 per cent of households have four or more people in them.\nWeirdly, though, the district also has the city's highest unemployment rate, at 7.3 per cent.\nPerhaps that's why the city's richest riding is neither Yellowknife North nor South \u2014 it's Range Lake, which is home to the most mining and oil and gas workers of any district.\nIn Range Lake, four in 10\u00a0households report an annual income of $200,000 or more \u2014 not exactly Scrooge McDuck status with Yellowknife's cost of living, but the highest income bracket Statistics Canada includes on its forms.

That's despite the fact that the district is home to the city's oldest housing stock \u2014 more than 60 per cent of houses are nearing 50 years old.\nMaybe those high prices are putting stress on people's marriages. Almost one-quarter of Yellowknife's divorcees live in Yellowknife Centre, and it's also home to more than a third of the city's widows.

As well, under the current model, those in high-value areas like downtown pay much more than those on the outskirts of the city.\n\"Our commercial streets are bleeding, and we have to stop the hemorrhaging because\u00a0otherwise, we might be putting a lot more effort and a lot more money to get back to a normal situation,\" he said.\nBut taxes aren't the only problem. Corporate landlords can afford to buy up bushels of buildings in an area, raise the rent and then wait for the next big franchise to move in. People like Usher can't afford to leave her commercial space\u00a0empty for months, so she charges less rent to keep her storefront occupied.\nHer tenant, Robert Sutcliffe, said he searched the neighbourhood for four months for an affordable place to open Art et Son, a shop specializing in retro home stereo systems.\nThe vacant commercial spaces owned by corporate landlords\u00a0would have cost him thousands more, so he felt lucky to discover Usher's storefront.\n\"This one fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for,\" he said. Still, he'd\u00a0like to see fewer vacancies on the street to attract more shoppers to the area.\nUsher is among those calling on the city to levy fines against landlords who leave commercial space empty.\nShe said those fines should be aimed at landlords\u00a0who have raised the rent more than 50 per cent\u00a0and have left a\u00a0space vacant for more than six months.\nMontreal architect Ron Rayside would also like to see landlords penalized for failing to fill vacancies because, he told the city commission, lowering\u00a0rents is a sure way to attract a tenant.\u00a0\nRayside, who owns a\u00a0couple of retail spaces himself, is a partner in a firm located on a commercial strip on Ontario Street East.\u00a0\nHe's always managed to keep his commercial space filled by keeping rents\u00a0low, he said. Once he even dropped the rent\u00a0down to a mere $100 per month, offering a local artist a short-term lease to help him get\u00a0his business off the ground.\nThe deal ensured the unit was maintained, secure and not just another vacancy in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, he said.\nThere are creative ways like that to keep retail space occupied if landlords are motivated to do so, Rayside said. And it might take penalties to create that motivation.\u00a0\nBut the city needs to do its part, as well, he said. He suggested more flexible zoning regulations that would allow property owners to be more creative with their properties.\nThe Montreal youth council made a similar suggestion, saying it would like to see empty storefronts put to use with temporary occupation permits.\n\"You could even have other, non-residential uses that are not commercial, per se, even temporary spaces \u2014 whether it be for artists or other uses,\" Rayside said.\n\"Once we decide from a social point of view and a commercial and city point of view\u00a0that vacant commercial spaces are really bad for the commercial artery or bad for the dynamic of a neighbourhood, then there are all kinds of different ways to solve it.\"\n"}, {"author": "Lukas Wall", "title": "Ball, O'Regan to make 'significant announcement' on Monday after rate mitigation talks over weekend", "description": "'The ball is in the government's court, so let's hear from Premier Ball,' says Ches Crosbie", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ball-oregan-significant-announcement-monday-1.5457659", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4469970.1514911951!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dwight-ball-seamus-o-regan.png", "publishedAt": ["Feb 09, 2020 4:52 PM NT", "2020-02-09T21:37:17.986Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Office of the Premier says Dwight Ball and\u00a0federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan\u00a0will make a \"significant announcement\" on Monday, joined by provincial Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady.\nTalks were ongoing over the weekend about striking an agreement for a rate mitigation plan for Muskrat Falls.\u00a0Ball told reporters on Friday conversations between both governments had made\u00a0\"considerable advancement\" over the past\u00a0week.\nThe premier has said renegotiating the terms of the agreements with the federal government could help save $200 million a year. That's needed to keep hydro rates from almost doubling when Muskrat Falls starts producing power.\nThe federal government agreed to back the loans before construction started on the project, leading to lower interest rates than if the province had borrowed the money on its own.\nThe skyrocketing costs of the project \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0has risen to $12.7\u00a0billion, more than double the original cost submitted to the Public Utilities Board in 2011 \u2014\u00a0have driven the projected price of electricity above 20 cents a kilowatt-hour.\nBall has promised to find a way that neither ratepayers nor taxpayers will have to foot the bill.\nFor both the Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats, the announcement could answer some of the questions left by the release of the Public Utilities Board's final report on Muskrat Falls on Friday evening.\nPC Leader Ches Crosbie says the report provides some good insight into possible options for rate mitigation, but cost savings found by the board in its report still leave the government about $400 million short of meeting its goal rate.\n\"Mr. Ball, let's remember, has promised that neither ratepayers nor taxpayers would have to pay for Muskrat Falls,\" he said.\n\"In order to achieve that, he owes the province an explanation as to where that money is going to come from.\u2026 The ball is in the government's court, so let's hear from Premier Ball.\"\nCrosbie said Ottawa has a major role\u00a0in the hydroelectric project and should bear some of the costs as well.\u00a0\n\"This project would not have gone forward without the federal loan guarantees. The federal government, in my view, is our partner in this,\" he said.\n\"Where the project has gone way over budget, has gone wrong in a number of ways, the federal government is going to have to share in the solution. The solution is not just changing the terms of financing.\u2026 The solution has to involve substantial federal new money as well.\"\nBut even with a significant contribution from the federal government, Crosbie said it still might not be enough to meet the province's target power rate of 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\"Now it's time for both the provincial and federal Liberals to come clean on what kind of help Ottawa's going to give us, and as well on where else we're going to find the money to make up this gap.\"\nNDP Leader Alison Coffin also says the provincial government could still be on the hook for a significant amount of money, despite help from Ottawa.\u00a0\n\"Even with the government of Canada jumping in with their $200 million \u2014 and we still don't know if they're going to do that for sure \u2014 we're still looking at a shortfall of about $200 million,\" she said.\n\"It does mean that we're going to be looking for more money somehow, or we're going to have to look at a way of being able to afford to go\u00a0to a slightly higher rate than 13.5 [cents per kilowatt-hour], which the Liberals had promised.\"\nCoffin said with the rate mitigation option laid out in the PUB's report, Ball's Liberals will still have to act swiftly to keep power rates from climbing.\n\"I think this is going to be the time for government to really step up and we'll get a good sense of if they are truly engaged and dedicated to keeping rates right,\" she said.\n\"The Liberal government has really been delaying a lot of decision making, so I have some concerns about the [reality] of the timeline.\u2026 This issue is really far too important to be delayed any longer.\"\nBoth leaders said if a rate mitigation plan isn't able to keep power costs from climbing, it would be devastating for ratepayers.\n\"If we have more increases \u2026 we have more and more money that we have to use for power out of a relatively fixed pot of income, then that extra money is going to have to come from somewhere,\" Coffin said.\n\"People are going to have to cut back on their groceries, or their leisure goods, or their housing, or their cars.\"\nCrosbie\u00a0echoed Coffin's concerns.\n\"Most people are at the edge of their budgets as things stand now, or beyond for that matter \u2014 how are they going to find the money to pay for a 75 per cent increase\u00a0in their power bills?

Will the NDP keep its grip on Hamilton Centre without longtime MP David Christopherson? Will\u00a0Hamilton East-Stoney Creek MP Bob Bratina\u00a0pay any kind of price for alienating the steelworkers' union, a group he's sought to represent through the all-party steel caucus?\nIt's tough to say\u00a0what the campaign will focus on as the countdown\u00a0to Canada's 43rd\u00a0general\u00a0election on Oct. 21 begins.\nPeter Graefe, a political science professor at McMaster University, said some have predicted it will be messy and include \"personality attacks.\" Still, the parties have put some policies on the table and the professor said issues around rising housing costs, employment and benefits could come into play for Hamilton.\nOne issue that doesn't seem to be on any party's radar, but nevertheless is sure to have large and lasting repercussions for Hamilton, is industrial policy, he added.\n\"It isn't sexy,\" Graefe said with a laugh. \"We continue to be a major manufacturing centre, but one that's facing all kinds of competition, and there seems to be no collective plan from the federal government \u2026 about how we could do better at it.\"\nThe city has seen a flurry of visits from federal party leaders in recent months, with Trudeau, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and NDP\u00a0leader Jagmeet Singh all stopping in\u00a0Hamilton on\u00a0Labour Day.\nEach of the three major parties are currently represented in Hamilton's five electoral districts. One seat is held\u00a0by the Conservatives, while the Liberals and NDP each claim two\u00a0apiece.\nBut that could change this time around, said the professor, with\u00a0tight races expected across the region.\n\"[For] all the parties, if they're counting every seat this time, there's a number in Hamilton which may be in play for them.\"\nThis riding\u00a0makes up the hear of Hamilton's\u00a0federal electoral districts and has been an NDP stronghold since it was created in 2003.\nFor all that time, the seat has been held by David Christopherson, a member of parliament known for his thundering oration and staying power. But Christopherson announced back in July that he's retiring, raising an interesting question: Will the NDP be able to make sure the seat stays orange?\nMatthew Green certainly hopes so. The outspoken\u00a0former Hamilton city councillor is the new candidate for the riding, saying he wants to follow in Christopherson's footsteps.\nAlso running is:\nThe riding has traded hands between the Liberals and NDP over the years, with longtime Hamilton figure and former mayor\u00a0Bob Bratina\u00a0winning the seat during the last federal election.\nBut Bratina, who has sought to represent steelworkers as co-chair of the all-party steel caucus, came under fire earlier this year following a pensioners meeting where union officials reported him as saying \"f--ck the steelworkers.\"\nBratina\u00a0denied the alleged statements, but\u00a0said he\u00a0regrets the \"inferences\" that came out of the\u00a0meeting.\nThe union responded by demanding an apology and planning a rally outside his constituency office.\nAlso running is:\nAs the oldest electoral district\u00a0in Hamilton, the Mountain has been represented by all three major parties since the riding was created in 1968.\nMost recently, Scott Duvall of the NDP has held the seat since 2015.\nThis time around,\u00a0Graefe says Duvall might have his hands full\u00a0trying to play defence\u00a0against former Ticats player and \"local hero\"\u00a0Peter Dyakowski, who is running for the Conservatives.\n\"It's a riding that has kind of a three-way race,\" said the professor.\nAlso running is:\nThe electoral district was created in 2012 and has only been represented by Liberal MP Filomena Tassi, who won the seat in 2015.\nGraefe said he believes Tassi has a strong hold on her riding, but noted\u00a0\"most\u00a0of these ridings are at some point\u00a0competitive,\" meaning every race is worth watching closely.\nAlso running is:\u00a0\nThe lone Conservative seat in the region has been\u00a0held by David Sweet since the 2015 election.\nSweet has held a seat in the House of Commons since 2006, when he was first elected to what was then called Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale.\nGraefe said the Conservatives will be looking to hold onto Sweet's seat, but noted it will be interesting to see if the riding has tired of his leadership and whether returning Liberal candidate Jennifer Stebbing will continue to build\u00a0support.\nAlso running is:\n"}, {"author": "Aaron Wherry", "title": "With Singh's environment plan, the left-centre climate change bidding war begins", "description": "It's aspirational and unclear \u2014 and it's designed to keep the Greens at bay while boxing in the Liberals", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-climate-change-green-party-1.5157591", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5158425.1559338932!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/ndp-singh-environment-20190531.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 01, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-06-01T18:07:24.845Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "R.B. Bennett might have warned Jagmeet\u00a0Singh against framing the NDP's climate plan the way he\u00a0did\u00a0Friday morning.\n\"I've been inspired by people who want to bring a green new deal to Canada,\" the NDP leader said.\u00a0\"Canadians need and want a new deal.\"\nAnd so, Singh released what the NDP is calling a \"new deal for climate action and good jobs\" \u2014 a sprawling (but still somewhat notional)\u00a0agenda for preserving the planet.\nIn January 1935, having struggled to respond to the Great Depression, Prime Minister Bennett announced a series of social welfare reforms and economic interventions that resembled the \"New Deal\" that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had started implementing two years earlier.\nBennett never himself referred to his plan as a \"new deal,\" but critics applied the tag derisively and the name stuck.\u00a0Bennett's \"new deal\" is remembered now as a belated pivot that came much too late to save a doomed prime minister.\nLast year, two American Democrats\u00a0\u2014 one of them\u00a0the popular and charismatic congresswoman\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 introduced what they referred as to as the \"Green New Deal,\" a sweeping (but vague) plan for government intervention to deal with the global emergency of climate change. The basic idea of a Rooseveltian response proved interesting enough that some\u00a0Canadian progressives began to agitate for something similar.\nWhat Singh brought forward on Friday was an attempt to capture a similar sense of\u00a0excitement\u00a0\u2014 a feeling that has been lacking around Singh since he became leader of the NDP in October 2017. It's also another move in the progressive bidding war on climate action \u2014 with Singh now needing to fend off\u00a0the Greens to hold third place.\nTwo weeks ago, Elizabeth May's Green Party\u00a0announced that it would aim to cut Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, without quite explaining how they would do that. Singh's New Democrats\u00a0aren't yet committing to a specific target, though they do say that they would set a target that is\u00a0\"in line with stabilizing the global temperature increase at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\" That, they figure, would mean a reduction of somewhere between 40 per cent and 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.\nHow would a Singh government get there? It's not entirely clear. The NDP plan\u00a0does spend several pages throwing out an array of ideas that New Democrats claim would result in an emissions cut of 38 per cent. But they aren't showing their math yet.\nLike the American version, Singh's new deal speaks more about investment and jobs than restrictions and regulation. There's a section on training and income support, with a focus on workers in \"carbon-intensive industries.\"\nThe current federal framework includes commitments to increase energy efficiency and retrofit buildings.\u00a0But Singh sets a target to\u00a0retrofit all housing stock in Canada by 2050. Meanwhile, a \"climate bank\" would be established to \"spur investment in the low carbon economy.\"\nA \"Climate Accountability Office\" would be established to track and report on the government's progress. Like the Liberals, the NDP would act to advance\u00a0the adoption of electric and zero-emission vehicles.\u00a0The total budget for all measures in the platform document\u00a0is pegged at $15 billion over four years.\nWhile vowing to be bolder than Justin Trudeau's government, Singh's New Democrats say they will leave the federal carbon price as it is. Apparently they've\u00a0seen how hard it is for the Liberals to sell the current price and decided against trying to win support for an even higher rate.\nWhat they would change, slightly, is the way large, trade-exposed industries are handled. The Liberals have adopted an \"output-based pricing system\" for such emitters, modelled after a similar system introduced in Alberta by Rachel\u00a0Notley's\u00a0NDP\u00a0government. In the word of the federal NDP, a Singh government would be committed to \"rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters.\"\nThe output-based system is a\u00a0little more complicated than that.\nThe\u00a0two-part industrial system\u00a0involves a carbon levy and a subsidy, with the subsidy linked to the average emissions intensity in a given sector. The Liberals originally proposed that emitters would receive a subsidy that covered 70 per cent of the average. After consulting with industry, the Liberals set thresholds at 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the average. If a firm emits less than that, it receives a credit that it can sell to a firm that emits above that mark.\nThe NDP isn't proposing to eliminate the system. Rather, they say they want to set the subsidy thresholds back at 70 per cent.\nThe system is meant to ensure companies that compete internationally don't simply relocate their emissions-producing activities to countries with lower standards. But both the Conservatives and New Democrats have criticized that approach as a special concession. Now, the NDP is suggesting it plans on \"rolling back the breaks the Liberals have given to big polluters\"\u00a0\u2014 which could have some economic impact.\nOther promises in the NDP plan seem more wishful.\u00a0A commitment to promote free public transit is cast as both conditional and aspirational: \"For provinces and municipalities that identify it as a priority, we will help them build towards fare-free transit.\"\nA Singh government would also \"use the powers of the federal government to ensure that the provinces set and meet interim emissions reduction targets in the lead up to 2030 and 2050.\"\nApparently undaunted by the Trudeau government's toil and trouble over the last four years to get the provinces to accept a common policy approach, a Singh government would aim to negotiate and enforce targets for each province. Members of the Ottawa press gallery would at least be happy to have a few more fractious first ministers' conferences to cover.\nThe New Democrats have five months to fill in more details on what they would do and how they would do it, but this new list of commitments does at least present a challenge for the Liberals. For the past two years, they've had to defend themselves from Conservative complaints that they were doing too much. The NDP and the Greens now will hit them from the other side, arguing that they should do more.\nAt the moment, the greater threat for the Liberals is still from the Conservatives. But Singh might now have a rallying cry, however unoriginal, to apply a little pressure of his own.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/cost-of-living/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/cost-of-living/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1575908931943", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Jordan Omstead", "title": "Rogers Place: Was it worth it?", "description": "A look back at the Rogers Place deal as Calgary mulls proposed arena", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/rogers-place-worth-cost-arena-deal-1.5227897", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4466577.1528222068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/rogers-place.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 28, 2019 11:24 AM MT", "2019-07-28T17:24:42.902Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As Calgary city council prepares to vote on a multi-million dollar arena deal, Edmontonians might be feeling a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nWhen the Rogers Place arena deal was approved in 2013, it came with plenty of potential, promises and\u00a0possibilities.\nThere was\u00a0the promise of attracting billions of dollars in investment; the prospect of using public money to support a multi-million dollar sports franchise; the guarantee of keeping the Edmonton Oilers\u00a0in town for decades to come.\u00a0\nNow, the city's neighbour to the south is grappling with the\u00a0same discussions.\nSo, six years after inking the deal and three years since the arena's debut, is Rogers Place worth the cost?\nThe Katz Group is paying for 27 per cent of\u00a0Edmonton's $613-million arena project. By comparison, the Flames ownership group and Calgary would split the cost of the $550-million project 50/50.\u00a0\nThe City of Edmonton\u00a0pitched $312 million for the project, with the rest of the money\u00a0coming from a city-levied ticket surcharge. The project price tag includes money for the Winter Garden, LRT connection to the arena, a pedestrian walkway and the Downtown Community Arena.\nDespite the hefty public investment, Coun.\u00a0Scott McKeen said\u00a0the development boom in his ward is a sign of the project's early legacy.\n\"Downtown has taken off,\" he said.\u00a0\nINTERACTIVE: Drag the slider to compare the Rogers Place site in 2009 and 2018\nThe Downtown Business Association found the amount of \"underdeveloped\" land downtown shrunk to 40 per cent in 2016, down from 52 per cent a year before the arena deal was signed.\nThe 2017 report found a handful of approved projects worth more than $2 billion were expected to be complete by 2022.\u00a0\n\"Given what's happened downtown, I think it was one of those rare circumstances where the public investment in a major sporting facility really worked,\" said McKeen, who was not yet a councillor when the deal was signed.\u00a0\n\"We wouldn't be here without ...\u00a0the courage of that previous council because, man, it was controversial. It was really controversial.\"\u00a0\nTony Caterina, one of three councillors who voted against the deal in 2013, cautions against giving the arena undue credit for downtown development.\u00a0\n\"The timing was fortunate that we had a number of projects all ready to go, and I think that just accelerated the development of the area,\" he said.\u00a0\nCaterina would have liked to see more outward-facing retail spaces built into Rogers Place.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately, that didn't happen,\" he said. \"If there's no event going on, obviously there's no traffic in the building and the street looks deserted.\"\u00a0\nBut McKeen expects downtown to enliven as the Ice District is fully realized.\n\"We have not seen the complete picture yet,\" he said.\nEven if the area becomes the lively hub pictured in the original renderings, some people are still concerned about the use of public money to subsidize private sports franchises.\nIn fact, Edmonton set\u00a0a Canadian precedent when it comes to spending public dollars on a sports arena, said\u00a0Jay Scherer, a professor at the University of Alberta who specializes\u00a0in sports sociology. Now, Calgary could do the same.\n\"In terms of the big picture of what cities do and what they stand for, it's of such little importance in terms of providing infrastructure for all citizens, to ensuring that our most vulnerable are looked after,\" said Scherer, who is researching Edmonton's arena and downtown district.\u00a0\n\"Those are the things that make a city worthwhile, not spending money on professional sports.\"\nScherer said\u00a0he has never\u00a0seen a fully detailed argument or study that shows why wealthy team owners can't\u00a0finance an arena\u00a0independently.\nHe noted\u00a0Edmonton has debt-financed most of the arena project, since the lion's share of the Katz Group contribution is being paid as rent over the 35-year life of the deal.\u00a0\n\"What you're buying really is a guarantee that the Oilers are going to stay in Edmonton for the next 35 years, and you're paying a significant price to do that,\" Scherer said.\u00a0\n\"Certainly, the development has been very impressive to see. The profits going to the Oilers\u00a0in some of those instances\u00a0have been very impressive as well.\"\nForbes estimates the value of the team leaped to $400 million when the deal was signed in 2013, from $225 million the previous year. The team's value has grown steadily since, rising to $540 million in 2018.\u00a0\nMcKeen said\u00a0it's not just about money.\u00a0\nHe echoed former Mayor Stephen Mandel's concerns that the Oilers would have relocated if the city didn't strike a deal.\u00a0\nIf the Oilers had left town, McKeen said\u00a0Edmonton would have lost a powerful unifying force.\n\"It seems almost silly, but we don't have many things in our culture these days that unify an entire community\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an entire city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the Edmonton Oilers do that,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhile the Oilers might create a sense of unity among hockey fans, Scherer\u00a0said the arena itself is exclusive, as game tickets are prohibitively expensive.\nHe also said\u00a0issues of gentrification didn't get proper consideration\u00a0during negotiations. The community benefits section of the deal, drafted without community input, makes up just one page of the 34-page deal.\nCritics have lamented the lack of firm targets for money toward affordable housing or jobs for people living in the community.\u00a0\nIt's still early days for the arena deal, Scherer\u00a0said, and its full merit and faults are yet to be seen.\u00a0\n\"Anyone who is going to say this is an immediate success story is being a bit premature.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on March 29", "description": "1.6M Canadians have applied for employment insurance, says employment minister", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-canada-world-march29-1.5513994", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 29, 2020 7:11 AM ET", "2020-03-30T07:41:44.200Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nAbout 1.6 million Canadians have applied for employment insurance due to the coronavirus outbreak, Canada's employment minister said Sunday.\n\"In the height of the 2008 [financial crisis] there was about 38,000 [EI applicants] on our absolute worst day,\"\u00a0Carla Qualtrough told CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup.\n\"We hit about 275,000 in one day last week,\" she said, adding there's \"enormous need\" from out-of-work Canadians.\nThe federal government launched a $52-billion aid package last week that will provide $2,000 per month for four months to Canadians whose livelihoods are affected by COVID-19.\nThere have been concerns about the EI system being overwhelmed by claims, and\u00a0Qualtrough said the government is trying to streamline the process and send money to those eligible by mid-April.\nAlso Sunday,\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced new federal funding for those experiencing higher levels of\u00a0stress\u00a0because of\u00a0self-isolation policies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including children, seniors, the homeless\u00a0and those facing violence at home.\nHe said the government is contributing $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to hire more counsellors, adding that children feeling anxious should go online, call 1-800-668-6868, or text 686868 to reach the service.\nWATCH | Trudeau offers message to young Canadians:\nTrudeau also said he's offering $9 million to the United Way through the government's New Horizons for Seniors Program to help provide things such as health checks and grocery or meal delivery service.\nThe government is allocating $50 million to women's shelters and sexual assault centres, including facilities in Indigenous communities \u2014 and $157 million to help those experiencing\u00a0homelessness.\u00a0\nIn the United States,\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 the\u00a0government's foremost infectious\u00a0disease expert \u2014 said the country\u00a0could see\u00a0\"millions of cases\" of COVID-19 and between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths related to the coronavirus.\nWATCH |\u00a0U.S. could see over 1M COVID-19 cases, says top doctor:\nFauci,\u00a0director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was speaking to CNN's State of the Union program\u00a0on Sunday as the U.S. was leading\u00a0the world in the number of reported infections, estimated at more than\u00a0130,000.

Our members care deeply about human rights, and we are committed to investing responsibly.\"\nAn\u00a0inspection of one of GEO Group's\u00a0immigration detention facilities in Adelanto, Calif., last year found nooses in detainee cells, improper and overly restrictive segregation and inadequate medical care, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nAt another GEO Group facility in Aurora, Colo.,\u00a0detainees were not allowed visits from friends or families, even though there was room for them to do so, according to the same report.\u00a0\nThe human rights organization Amnesty International is \"very concerned\" by those reports\u00a0said Justin Mohammed, its human rights law and policy campaigner in Canada.\u00a0\nHe suggested the pension plan should \"ask questions\" and\u00a0\"ensure that their investments are being done in a manner that is responsible.\"\n\"Considering that they are teachers and we're talking about some violations that may relate to young people, certainly we'd think that teachers would have a particular concern about the human rights of children,\" said Mohammed.\nThe teachers' pension plan isn't the only Canadian institution to have invested in GEO Group. In October, the Guardian reported that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board owned more than $10 million in shares, total, in both GEO Group and another private prison operator,\u00a0CoreCivic Inc.\u00a0\nSince then the public pension fund for retired Canadians has sold all of its shares in the two companies, but another public institution has kept its stock.\nThe Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), which manages many public sector pensions and other government funds, has shares in both GEO Group and CoreCivic worth a total of about $4.8 million, as of March 31, according to its filings.\u00a0\nAIMCo\u00a0declined to comment for this story, saying in an email it \"does not discuss specific holdings within our portfolios.\"\nSo how exactly do institutions, like pension funds, choose what to invest in? \u00a0\nThe traditional approach would be to just consider a company's financial statements. But experts say responsible investing has entered the mainstream, which sees many institutional investors consider the environmental, social and governance factors of a company before buying shares.\u00a0\nBoth the OTPPB and AIMCo have committed to responsible investing by signing the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment, which calls on investors to consider factors including the environment and social issues.\u00a0\nResponsible investing is\u00a0\"about considering things like human rights abuses,\" said Dustyn Lanz, CEO of the Toronto-based\u00a0Responsible Investment Association.\n\"If that's happening in the supply chain that could actually impact the share price of that company due to headline risk over the long term.\"\u00a0\nLanz says considering social and environmental factors is a necessary component of responsible investing \u2014 it doesn't mean that ethical reasons for not investing always win the day.\nTessa Hebb, with Carleton University's Centre for Community Innovation, agrees.\u00a0\nIt's a \"risk-return kind of equation,\" Hebb told CBC News. \"The primary driver for the investor is to reduce risk in their portfolio.\"\nBoth also say another part of responsible investing can involve\u00a0engaging with a company as a shareholder and pushing it to improve its standards, instead of divesting one's shares when the company gets into some sort of trouble.\n\"Selling your security to someone else who maybe doesn't care as much \u2026 that's not necessarily going to have any effect at all on the company,\" said Lanz.\u00a0\nIn that vein, late last year a shareholder of GEO Group tried to push the company to adopt a policy that would make sure it doesn't house\u00a0children or parents who are\u00a0separated during immigration proceedings.\nThe company opposed the resolution, denying it was housing children separated from parents, but also arguing it might enter contracts to house separated children in the future as part of \"its ordinary business operations.\"\nDespite opposing the resolution, GEO Group told CBC News in a statement that its facilities\u00a0\"have not and do not house unaccompanied minors including those who may have been separated from their parents or legal guardians, nor will they in the future.\"\n"}, {"author": "Michael Gorman", "title": "Budget aimed at health care, education and poverty likely to fuel N.S. election talk", "description": "Fallout from Northern Pulp closure and coronavirus could hurt province's economic growth", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/budget-aimed-at-health-care-education-and-poverty-likely-to-fuel-n-s-election-talk-1.5475294", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5475301.1582651006!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/karen-casey.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2020 1:16 PM AT", "2020-02-25T19:23:37.360Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "If Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil hoped to quell recent talk of a pending provincial election, his government's budget on Tuesday won't help.\nWith estimated expenses of $11.5 billion and a $55-million surplus, the 2020-21 budget sees major infrastructure projects beginning to ramp up, further increases in spending on health care and education, and the McNeil government's most targeted effort to date in trying to reduce poverty, all while some economic uncertainty looms.\nIn her budget speech, Finance Minister Karen Casey said that while the province might be in a \"positive fiscal position,\" the budget is intended to support people \"who may not have been feeling the success of the province.\"\nTo that end, the government will spend $18 million to increase the low-income threshold for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, extending it to families with incomes below $34,000. The change is expected to help 28,000 families and 49,000 children.\nThe standard household rate will become fully funded this year thanks to an additional $17.3 million and there's $16.6 million for the Disabilities Support Program.\nAmong other things, the government is promising that new money will help transition residents from larger care facilities into community-based living. In her speech, Casey said 50 people would make the move this year, with more in the following three years.\nHousing Nova Scotia will add 560 new rent supplements, 120 of which will be directed to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The government is also planning to spend $20.5 million in the next five years for the Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness. The intention is to help people find permanent, stable and safe housing.\nCommunity Services officials said the increased funding reflects how stubborn the poverty issue has been and that efforts to date haven't moved the needle far enough. Nova Scotia has lagged behind other provinces in recent Statistics Canada reports on poverty rates for children and families.\n\"We saw numbers come out that saw us drop\u00a0\u2014 the largest drops inside of Canada, but it's still too high,\" McNeil told reporters.\n\"And this is an acknowledgement of that and this is an investment in those kids, kids in our province who are living in poverty.\"\nHealth care, as always, gobbles up the largest proportion of the budget.\nThis year, the Health Department's budget will hit $4.8 billion, almost 42 per cent of the total.\nThere's $75.3 million more for doctors following the recently announced new master agreement. There's also previously announced money for more seats at Dalhousie University's medical school and for resident training, and money to create 70 new nursing seats \u2014 62 at Cape Breton University and eight at Dalhousie's satellite campus in Yarmouth.\nThere's more money for a variety of drug programs and $1 million for a new ovarian cancer research program at Dalhousie.\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority will see its budget increase by $77.7 million, while the bottom line at the IWK Health Centre will go up by $8.4 million.\nThe government will also spend $3.2 million to implement the new Human Organ Tissue Donation Act, money that will go toward doing more transplants.\nThe Education Department's major increases include $21.5 million to complete the rollout of pre-primary and another $15 million for the recommendations in the Commission on Inclusive Education's report.\nThe student loan forgiveness program is increasing by $2.2 million to now include graduates of the Nova Scotia Community College, a move that should affect 1,400 people as of this summer.\nThen there's the capital plan.\nAs Casey announced last week, it will hit $1 billion this year, driven primarily by hospital construction and renovation, buying and building 46 schools, and work on highways, roads and bridges. This year's operating grant for the Nova Scotia-to-Maine ferry is $16.3 million.\nThere's also about $40 million dedicated to green programs, such as energy efficiency programs and community-based projects to address climate change.\nThe spending is helped by $395 million more from Ottawa this year, including more money for equalization ($200 million) and the federal health transfer ($41.3 million).\nOpposition leaders and others were critical of the budget, saying it either didn't go far enough on certain issues or\u00a0placed too much emphasis on some things at the expense of others.\nTory Leader Tim Houston called the document an\u00a0election budget filled with investments that should have come \"years ago.\"\nHouston pointed to the $700,000 to create the new nursing school seats as an example.\n\"They could have easily started that three years ago and we'd be graduating nurses today instead of trying to look for someone to go in the program,\" he said.\nHouston said the level of transfer payments the province is receiving from Ottawa is proof that things aren't as fiscally strong as the government would have people believe.\n\"There is huge headwinds before this province for sure and easily our economy could shrink this year and that's a major concern,\" he said.\nNDP Leader Gary Burrill\u00a0called it a tale of two budgets, with\u00a0\"a great banquet feast\" laid out for the business community while the most needy get \"crumbs.\"\n\"It has the character of a fiscal deathbed confession,\" he told reporters.\n\"After years in which the province has really been starved for social spending, now, on the front porch of an election, we have all these crumbs being tossed in all kinds of different directions. So the spending, yes, fine, but it's a little bit little and it's a whole lot late.\"\nChristine Saulnier with\u00a0the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said the new funding aimed at addressing poverty doesn't go far enough.\n\"We need to do much\u00a0more than wait for a business sector to do something with a tax cut,\" she said.\n\"We've had 30 years to know what they're going to do: they're going to sit on it, their shareholders are going to be enriched, maybe some of their top employees, but we're not going to see the trickle down that apparently the premier thinks will be different here.\"\nHealth-care advocates said there were some things to be happy about, such as extending dialysis to rural communities, but\u00a0both Nan McFadgen of CUPE and Chris Parsons of the Nova Scotia Health Coalition were concerned there aren't any new long-term care beds included in the budget or support for the workers who staff those homes.\n\"It's a problem for anybody that wants access to any kind of health care because it just flows through all of the system,\" said McFadgen.\nThe government may be opening up its wallet, but this budget will require people who smoke and vape to do the same. All tobacco taxes will increase as of Feb. 26. That includes a two cent increase per cigarette, increasing the tax on cigars from 60 per cent to 75 per cent and an increase on fine cut and other forms of tobacco to 40 cents per gram.\nVape products will begin being taxed in September and retailers will require a permit, the cost of which has yet to be finalized, in July. The vape tax, the second in the country after B.C., will include $0.50 per millilitre of liquid and 20 per cent of the retail value of all devices. For example, the taxes would amount to $10.40 for a $45 starter vape kit.\n\"A small price to pay for our youth health,\" Casey told reporters.\nCasey said the measures, along with a previously-announced ban on flavoured vape products, are intended to target youth vaping rates.\nThe premier's previously announced tax breaks for small business (down from three per cent to 2.5) and the reduced corporate rate (down from 16 per cent to 14 per cent) are included in this budget, moves that will cost $81 million.\nOther tax measures include a five-year extension of both the digital media tax credit and digital animation tax credit. The Nova Scotia Film and Television Production Incentive Fund will rise to $25 million.\nThere are risks in this budget, as with any. The government has not accounted for the short-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak, and that includes what effect it might have on seafood exports to Asia, a market that in recent years has been the engine for economic growth.\nThere is also the question of the long-term effects of Northern Pulp's closure. The government estimates the tax hit of losing the mill is about $32 million, something Finance Department officials say is offset by an otherwise strong economy. But offsetting mitigations and transitions related to the mill closure are not factored into the budget.\nMcNeil told reporters the shutdown of Northern Pulp had no correlation\u00a0with the increased capital spending, other than money tied directly to already-announced funds and initiatives designed to help the forestry industry transition.\nThe province's real economic growth is expected to slow to 0.4 per cent in 2020 before reaching 1.2 per cent in 2021. The 2020-21 debt is estimated to hit $15.7 billion, with the debt-to-GDP ratio coming in at 33.3 per cent.\nThe debt is projected to increase in each of the next four years, driven by construction of hospitals, highways and schools. The government is also projecting balanced budgets in each of those years, aided in part by favourable debt servicing costs as long-term high-rate loans come off the books and are replaced by loans at much lower rates.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Hong Kong protesters vow to keep fighting extradition law", "description": "Police use rubber bullets, tear gas outside government headquarters", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-extradition-china-1.5171737", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jun 11, 2019 10:36 PM ET", "2019-06-12T22:16:15.986Z"], "source": null, "content": "Following a day of sit-ins, tear gas and clashes with police, Hong Kong students and civil rights activists vowed Wednesday to keep protesting a proposed extradition bill that has become a lightning rod for concerns over greater Chinese control and erosion of civil liberties in the former British colony.\nThe violence marked a major escalation of the biggest political crisis in years for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and forced the delay of legislative debate on the contentious bill.\nCollege student Louis Wong said he considered the blockade of government headquarters and the Legislative Council a success, because it appeared to prevent Beijing loyalists from advancing amendments to a pair of laws that would make it easier to send suspected criminals to China.\n\"This is a public space and the police have no right to block us from staying here,\" Wong said, surveying a garbage-strewn intersection in the Admiralty neighbourhood that had been blocked off by security forces after protesters broke through a police cordon and entered the government complex.\n\"We'll stay until the government drops this law and [Chinese President] Xi Jinping gives up on trying to turn Hong Kong into just another city in China like Beijing and Shanghai,\" he said.\nPolice Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung told reporters that officers used batons, pepper spray, beanbag rounds, rubber bullets, water hoses and tear gas against the demonstrators, taking action\u00a0after a group of masked protesters charged onto the roads in the\u00a0Admiralty district and started throwing objects, including metal barriers.\nLo\u00a0called the situation a riot, and said \"a\u00a0very dangerous action that could kill someone.\" He also said several people, including some officers, had been injured, and he urged protesters to return home.\nThe Hong Kong Hospital Authority said at least\u00a072 people were taken to hospitals from the protests, two in serious condition.\u00a0\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada is\u00a0following the proposal closely and is concerned about the effect it\u00a0could have on a large number of Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, as well as business confidence and Hong Kong's international reputation.\u00a0\nShe urged the Hong Kong government to \"listen to its people and its many friends around the world\" before\u00a0making any changes to the bill.\u00a0\nAmnesty International has condemned what it called excessive force by Hong Kong police against largely peaceful protesters demonstrating against a proposed extradition bill, saying it violates international law and is likely to lead to worsening violence.\nThe protesters overflowed onto a major downtown road as they overturned barriers and tussled with police outside the building\u00a0that also houses the chambers where the legislature was to discuss the bill, which would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China.\nWatch as police attend to an injured protester:\nMartin Lee, a lawyer, pro-democracy activist and the founding chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong's chief executive has a \"cold, cold heart\" for not considering the message from demonstrators of last weekend's massive protest against the proposed extradition law.\n\"I'm afraid our chief executive Carrie Lam has completely polarized our society. She has broken so many hearts today. These are young people in their teens, fighting for democracy and defending Hong Kong and hoping to stop Hong Kong from turning from an international financial centre into another Chinese city,\" Lee told CBC News.\nHe said people in the former British colony don't trust the courts or prisons in mainland China, and neither should the roughly 300,000 Canadians who are working and living in Hong Kong.\n\"The moment you are transferred [as a suspect] to mainland China, they make you confess before a TV camera. We have seen too much of this,\" Lee said.\nThe U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong said American citizens should avoid areas of Hong Kong where\u00a0protests are being held, \"exercise caution\" and \"keep a low profile.\"\u00a0The violence has prompted the Canadian government to update\u00a0its\u00a0travel advisory\u00a0for Hong Kong, acknowledging the demonstrations and advising travellers to \"exercise caution.\"\nCBC's Sa\u0161a Petricic, who\u00a0was in the streets of Hong Kong,\u00a0said the legislature was ringed with protesters, who had massed outside the government building overnight Tuesday and began pressing against\u00a0the police early Wednesday.\n\"There was union support and at least one instance of a bus driver who just simply parked his bus crossways on one of the major roads here\u00a0and blocked traffic,\" he said. \"It was just one of the scenes that played itself out today as the centre of the city was really paralyzed.\"\nWatch as protesters are hit with pepper spray:\nA protester who gave only his first name, Marco, said he hoped the protest would persuade Lam's administration to shelve the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.\n\"We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,\" Marco\u00a0said.\nA fellow protester who gave her name as King said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's young generation, who face difficult job prospects and skyrocketing housing prices.\nWatch as police fire tear gas:\n\"We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,\" she said.\nThe reluctance of protesters to be identified by their full names and professions \u2014 many wore surgical masks to obscure their facial features \u2014 reflected an increasingly hard-line approach to civil unrest by the authorities. Such actions are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border.\nChief Secretary for Administration Mathew Cheung\u00a0gave\u00a0no indication of when the delayed legislative debate would begin.\nStaff members were advised not to go to into work and those already on the premises were told to \"stay at their working place until further notice.\"\nSome businesses closed for the day, and labour strikes and class boycotts were called.\nWaiting game: Centre of Hong Kong paralyzed, many thousands on the streets and around legislature to protest extradition law, riot police ready.

However, China's ruling Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular legal changes.\nLam has consistently defended the legislation as necessary to close legal loopholes with other countries and territories. A vote was scheduled on June 20.\n\"There's no urgency at all, and they are rushing it,\" pro-democracy politician Martin Lee said.\n\"They want the whole thing to be finished next Thursday in Hong Kong. They want to do it as quickly as possible.\"\nCritics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of being entrapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offences, and would not be guaranteed free trials.\nLam, who cancelled her regular question and answer session on Wednesday, said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong would risk becoming a haven for fugitives.\nShe emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts.\nHong Kong currently limits extraditions to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record.\nThe mainland's ruling Communist Party exerts influence on the Hong Kong government. Lam was elected in 2017 by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites and was widely seen as the Communist Party's favoured candidate.\nThe Legislative Council includes a sizeable camp of pro-Beijing legislators.\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Liam Britten", "title": "'You feel ashamed': Despite tighter rules, struggling British Columbians still embrace payday loans", "description": "Industry says loans provide options to consumers and rules are forcing lenders to close", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/treading-water-payday-lending-1.5423410", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5426563.1579028528!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/payday-lending.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 15, 2020 4:00 AM PT", "2020-01-15T12:00:00.479Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Downtown Eastside poverty advocate Elli Taylor has seen many desperate people struggling with payday loans.\nShe's been that person herself.\nIn 2014, while working as a part-time convenience store clerk in Williams Lake, Taylor took out what she thought would be a manageable $250 loan to buy a bus pass and\u00a0Christmas presents for her 14-year-old twins.\nHer take-home pay was about\u00a0$250\u00a0every two weeks, but monthly instalment payments of $50 became a problem with the then-legal rate of $20 interest and fees for every $100 loaned.\n\"You're snowballing into not being able to afford your groceries,\" Taylor said. \"You feel ashamed.

It's dehumanizing.\"\nIt's stories like that that make it clear why B.C. has tightened the rules for payday lenders starting in 2016:\u00a0lowering how much can be borrowed and the interest rates allowed.\nBut while the number of lenders has declined under these new rules, data show British Columbians are actually borrowing from them more.\u00a0\nPayday loans offer quick cash but demand interest and fees greater than other loan types especially if not repaid quickly \u2014 perhaps\u00a0six to seven times the cost of an equivalent amount from a credit card cash advance or line of credit.\nAdvocates say many low-income people can't access those cheaper options,\u00a0and payday lender regulations are missing the point: too many British Columbians just aren't making enough money to get by.\nIsaiah Chan, director of counselling of the Credit Counselling Society, said the fact that there aren't fewer people seeking help with those debts speaks to bigger problems with affordability.\n\"Something's triggered it: either some sort of disruption like a family emergency or job loss, illness, something where they have to quickly resort to borrowing money at a higher cost,\" Chan said.\n\"The story that we hear from clients [is] they had nowhere else to turn.\"\nSince 2016, the province has taken a series of steps to tighten\u00a0payday lending rules: the maximum fee for every $100 borrowed is now\u00a0$15, limits have been\u00a0placed on information collection and the amount that can be loaned has been lowered to half a paycheque or half the earnings of one pay period.\nChan welcomes those changes but isn't seeing an impact.\nThe society helped over 20,500 Canadians from B.C. to Ontario through its debt management program in 2019. About 30 per cent had payday loan problems, numbers similar to 2018.\nChan said the people who rely on these loans tend to be poorer, have few credit options and are \"desperate.\"\nTaylor remembers that desperation.\nFalling behind, unable to afford groceries and without other options,\u00a0she took out more loans to stay afloat. The lenders would send people to her house and call her employer.\nTaylor also has clinical\u00a0depression.

What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nAffordability is particularly important to my riding as it involves housing, seniors care, and post-secondary education.\u00a0\nSpecifically, to help seniors we have pledged to increase OAS for those who are 75 and older to provide greater financial security.\u00a0\nFor families looking to purchase a place of their own we introduced Canada's first National Housing Strategy to create new housing and repair and retrofit existing housing. Our First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, has the effect of a 10% purchase price reduction for first time home buyers.\nWe will continue to increase the number of grants, and provide up to $1,200 more to make post-secondary education more affordable.\u00a0Students won't have to start repaying their loans until they're earning at least $35,000 per year. This gives students more freedom to pursue and focus on their field of studies, without having to immediately take any job available post-graduation, whether or not in their field, simply to make payments.\nThere are a number of initiatives aimed at making life affordable for regular Canadians, and I look forward to being part of another Liberal government that brings that kind of positive change to the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nI will continue to advocate for policies like the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and the National Housing Strategy that are making a real difference for people in Waterloo\u00a0region I know the issues that face residents of Kitchener South-Hespeler, such as housing wait times and cost of living.\u00a0\nI have spoken to many families who are, for the first time, feeling the financial relief of the CCB and I want to ensure that those families, and many more can continue to rely on our support, because I know the difference it makes. This is why I'm also proud to support the strengthening of the CCB for parents with children under one-year-old, which is a very effective targeted increase.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nLiberals understand that the environment and climate change are an extremely high priority and as a result have implemented a multi-faceted environmental plan that tackles a number of different types of pollution in a concerted effort to limit our negative impact on nature and our climate.\nThe first of these is the carbon tax. It is no longer free to pollute in Canada. The higher price causes people to reduce their carbon emissions, while the rebate leaves most people with more than the tax costs them.\nFurthermore we moved to ban all single use plastics by 2021, which will not only reduce pollution from plastic bags and straws, but micro-plastics which are harmful to the environment due to the ease with which they can persist in ecosystems and even our food systems.\nA new Liberal government will also provide incentives for Canadians such as the, up to $40,000 interest free loan for the purposes of home retrofit to help existing homes reduce emissions.\nWe are committed to a thorough approach to combatting climate change and know that this is only possible with a complete and comprehensive strategy like ours.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI want the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler to know that my greatest driving force is ensuring that they are getting the services that they need and that I am part of a government that gives help to the families who need it most.\u00a0\nAs someone who was raised by a single mother\u00a0here in our riding, and who saw the difference that compassionate government programs can make, I want the opportunity to continue giving back to both this community and the country that afforded my family a chance to succeed.\u00a0\nWhile growing up I witnessed the hollowing out of the middle class\u00a0and I hope I will be able to continue my work for the people of Kitchener South-Hespeler and help to not just strengthen the middle class but open more opportunities for those working hard to join it.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nBy far, the top issue I am hearing about at the doors is how unaffordable life has become in our communities. Two thirds of Canadians feel that they either can't pay their bills \u2014 or feel that they have nothing left over at the end of the month after they do, and that is something being felt right here in Kitchener South-Hespeler.\nOver the past four years, costs have gone up, purchasing power is declining and families are finding it harder and harder to get ahead. Our middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than the average OECD\u00a0(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) country.\u00a0\nThe Conservatives have a plan to put more money back in the pockets of families, including a universal tax cut to all hard working taxpayers, returning the children's fitness tax credit, removing the GST off of home heating bills, increasing the government contribution for RESPs\u00a0(registered education savings plan), and increasing the age credit for seniors. We will also cancel $1.5 billion in corporate welfare and return that money to Canadians.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nWe have a plan to lower taxes and get the dollar going further for young folks, working families, and seniors. We also have a plan to spark our economy into action, as we now see it has stalled, limiting opportunity and prosperity.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe know that when our small businesses do well and grow in Canada, the result is shared prosperity for many. Having 10 years of experience in advising small businesses, I understand that they are the engine of our economy. I will champion our plan to cut taxes for small businesses, as well as to remove 25 per cent\u00a0of regulations that hold them back.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the people of our riding tell me they need better access to their MP. Many are going to other MPs for help with their concerns and opportunities. This is just wrong. I will get started on this problem by relocating the constituency office from the far end of Kitchener South to a more central location that better serves everyone in the riding. I'll also regularly host local businesses and community groups in Ottawa to help advocate for action that supports economic growth and improves affordability.\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nHaving earned a master's degree in the environmental sciences and having a passion for climate action, I am especially frustrated by Canada's abysmal ranking amongst the worst of G7 countries on climate action. Our policies are evaluated to have the same effectiveness as Donald Trump's, resulting from a carbon tax that Justin Trudeau has largely discounted for Canada's heaviest emitters.\nOur Conservative plan forces Canada's heaviest industrial emitters to pay sooner, tightening their emissions cap from 50kt currently to 40kt and requiring that they invest in the technology that brings them back in line with these tougher emissions standards.\nWe will focus on technology, not taxes, to become an energy independent country by 2030 while also taking our climate fight global. As a stronger exporter, we can displace heavier emitters in other countries. Additionally, our Carbon Capture and Storage technology can help other countries to reduce their emissions substantially.\nWe will also implement the Green Homes Tax Credit and Green Public Transit Tax Credit to help Canadians with their daily environmental efforts. Canada's Conservatives are committed to protecting our environment and give our country \u2014 and the world \u2014 the best chance at meeting our Paris targets.\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI was raised as a sixth-generation, hard-working Listowel sawmiller, which taught me from an early age about the importance of hard work, supporting local community, and environmental stewardship.\u00a0\nI was a lieutenant in the Canadian Armed Forces infantry reserves, serving both in Canada and in the UK, and possess a commitment to our veterans and men and women serving today.\u00a0\nI'm a business owner and a strong advocate for small businesses \u2013 the backbone of our economy \u2013 having spent my career helping small and medium-sized businesses to grow and create jobs as an operations and strategy consultant.\u00a0\nI'm passionate about climate action. I've earned an MSc in the environmental sciences from the University of Oxford, where I also completed my MBA. These studies inspired me to launch a service offering through a large consulting firm focused on helping small businesses to lower their carbon footprint.\u00a0\nI am thankful every day to share my life with my wife Jacqueline. We're fortunate to live in Doon South in our riding of Kitchener South-Hespeler, where I will work tirelessly to help folks get ahead.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it? \nThe top issue facing the Kitchener-South Hespeler\u00a0(KS-H) riding is the housing affordability crisis. The rising cost of housing continues to make the dream of purchasing a home an unattainable goal for so many, including families in KS-H.\nThe NDP is committed to making owning a home possible again and to maintain affordable, accessible rental options. I would support legislation to offer financial assistance to those looking to purchase their first home.\nAdditionally, the NDP plans to create and maintain affordable rental spaces. This is an initiative that will benefit many and I would encourage a development in the KS-H riding.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy.\u00a0What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nThe future of our economy depending on progress and innovation. I support the implementation of green initiatives that would create stable, long-term jobs in the region, in addition to tackling our dependence on fossil fuels and looming climate crisis. Innovation also occurs in the booming tech sector in Waterloo region.\nTax incentives and grants to develop industry in the area will similarly create job opportunities and keep KW competitive with the world. It does seem that the cost of living is climbing ever higher, and with the climate crisis affecting supply chains and the need for preventative infrastructure, costs will continue to climb.\nHowever, the NDP has plans to implement a pharmacare plan to reduce the cost of medications, a plan to lower the cost of internet and cell phone service, as well as the recent announcement of funding to create 500,000 new, affordable childcare spaces will be change that can directly impact Canadians that they will see in their day-to-day life.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nThe climate crisis is an emergency and it is time that the federal government act like it. So much burden is placed on individual citizens, although we all play a role in protecting our future, it is large corporations who are the biggest polluters and should bear the biggest responsibility.\nThe NDP will hold these polluters and other corporations who profit from environmental harm to a higher standard and redirect corporate subsidies towards green initiatives. These initiatives like investing in transit options, creating green energy programs, retrofitting older buildings to be energy efficient, and improving recycling facilities will both reduce our footprint and create stable work to areas across the country.\nHowever, Canada cannot do this alone. We need to build strong relationships and commitments with other countries around the world to effect real change and create a better future for everyone.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nI have a Bachelor of Arts degree, a diploma in engineering, and education in management and politics. I have 25 years of management experience and I have served on the board of directors of many non-profit organizations in Waterloo region and beyond.\u00a0\nThrough my volunteer efforts, and as a member of the Alliance Against Poverty, I have advocated for low cost transportation and housing affordability. As president of the Afghan Association of Waterloo Region, I have been campaigning for inclusion, belonging, and elimination of hatred. As a board member of Bridges-to-Belonging Waterloo Region, I have been advocating for people with autism and developmental disabilities.\nAs a member of the City of Kitchener's Safe and\u00a0Healthy Community Advisory Committee for the past eight\u00a0years, I have been seeking to eliminate the safety issues affecting residents of Kitchener. As a member of the Public Liaison Committee of Safety-Kleen Inc., I have been campaigning to make sure the company is not polluting the environment.\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe top issue that I have seen in the community is the lack of readily available mental health care, which often leads to self-medicating drug addictions with related drug crime and overdose deaths. Half the people in jail are mentally ill and this is due to insufficient mental health care putting people on the pathways to the worst outcomes.\u00a0\nWe need a proper mental health strategy, with funding and supports to help people be the healthiest versions of themselves as possible, thereby improving their lives and the social fabric of our community. This alleviates the exorbitant costs related to our inaction.\u00a0\nPolice repeatedly arrest the same people in chronic mental health distress, whom are taken to hospital and then released without admission to psychiatric care due to not being considered an immediate threat to themselves or anyone else. These sufferers are then often left without proper diagnosis or medical follow up supports sufficient to improve their mental health conditions, which leads to further encounters in which police are asked to intervene and take them back to the hospital in further revolving door contacts. Helping people in early stages of need eliminates costly hardships straining our community.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nWe need a royal commission to investigate and give recommendations for renewal of our taxation system. Far too complex and unfair rules allow the wealthiest to escape their fair share, while the burden of funding services has been put too heavily on personal taxpayers.\nRevenue Canada collects $154 billion per year from individuals plus another $37 billion in GST. Corporations only contribute $47 billion per year, which is a quarter that of the monies collected from individuals. Fifty years ago, Canada had essentially no debt when corporations share of taxes was more than personal income taxes. They need to pay their fair share and we must stop their escaping taxation through offshore havens.\u00a0\nPersonal credit card rates need to be capped at 10 points above the the Bank of Canada prime lending rate.\nWe need a GLI, guaranteed liveable\u00a0income, to replace our employment insurance, disability and pension safety nets so that a more efficient and effective means of eliminating poverty is put into action.\u00a0\nWe need to catch up to the vast number of countries that value the education of their citizens with tuition free university, college and trades training.\u00a0\nThese things will help living affordability.\n3.\u00a0The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nWe have a tremendous opportunity to create an estimated four\u00a0million jobs in the clean economy, which will bring prosperity to Canadians and bring environmental and energy sustainability to our country.\nEnding fossil fuel exports of our raw bitumen and natural gas, and ending imports of fossil fuels too, will eliminate the potential fuel spills in our oceans and shorelines. Using our domestic oil on a declining basis as we build up renewable energy infrastructure and as doing so, transition oil and gas workers into renewable energy fields will protect their ability to have gainful employment while also taking action to protect our environment.\u00a0\nThere will be jobs in building up and renewing our electrical energy grid along with infrastructure for charging electric cars and to power all our transportation. There will be jobs in retrofitting homes, businesses and institutions to make them more energy efficient and thereby be less carbon emitting and be less costly to operate. New homes and businesses built at net-zero carbon footprint standards can eliminate the need of external energy sources to power them. Solar with batteries can have an efficient home off the grid. We can act to make this a reality.\n4.\u00a0What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI appreciate and enjoy diversity. Whether it be food, culture, music, choice of reading material or with whom I have friendships. Having exposure to different personalities, their thinking and views has me feel the energy that infuses dynamic life and makes it worth experiencing, learning from and growing with it.\nI have enjoyed training in karate to blue belt and riding my motorcycle on country roads. I also enjoy oil painting, writing poetry and sitting quietly in a park or woodland.\nI believe nurturing your inner self, your higher self, is as important as taking care of your body. The best way to love yourself and have peace\u00a0is to love others without judgment or condemnation and care for their needs in service. I believe that communication and empathetic understanding between people are fundamental for respectful relationships, which is also true for international relations.\nGreater diplomacy and collaboration for the common good of all people in the world will bring more peace than the military industrial complex. I believe in a strong defence; but, more so in a strong alliance building for our global good, especially in us all together taking climate action and in protecting our mother earth's biodiversity.\u00a0\nWebsite\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\nI believe that the biggest issue facing us right now is the opioid crisis and the mental illness that goes hand in hand with it.\nI was lucky enough to recently accompany city officials and a hazmat team while they cleaned out a homeless encampment\u00a0on Marsland Drive right next to a public park. At the bottom of a small hill, they cleaned out two dumpsters of garbage and around 500 dirty needles. The workers themselves say the disposal kits given to drug users are rarely utilized. This is the 50th camp they've cleaned out this\u00a0year and they're on track to hit 75 by the end of the year. They will more than double last year's number of 28. It's an epidemic.\nWe give these poor people plenty of assistance to slowly kill themselves but no help to get off the drugs. This needs to change,\u00a0rehab needs to be more of a priority along with other mental health supports.\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\nCost of living is a huge concern for the People's Party and myself personally. As a working class family man, I feel prices getting higher, too.\nWe will save you hundreds of dollars a year on your groceries by abolishing supply management. Our income tax plan will\u00a0let you keep more of your money. We will tax 15 per cent\u00a0for anyone making less than $100,000\u00a0a year and 25 per cent\u00a0for those making over $100,000\u00a0a year.\nOne of our candidates in Erin Mills also drafted a private member's bill that would make CPP benefits tax free. This would greatly help\u00a0seniors and have my full support if elected. \u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\nThe narrative that man-made CO2 is the cause for all climate change is untrue. Over 30,000 scientists have signed petitions speaking out against the consensus myth. I agree that the climate is changing but there is no consensus on any one cause.\nThere\u00a0are so many factors that aren't considered. I would rather focus our efforts on concrete changes that are attainable. 1) We should clean our oceans first. They're the biggest ecosystem on the planet and we treat them like garbage dumps. Taking\u00a0full advantage of clean incineration technology, we can clean our oceans and solve an energy issue at the same time. 2) With oil and pipelines on everyone's minds, I'm surprised that few know about line 5, a pipeline running through the Straits of Mackinac, which\u00a0connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron.\nThis pipeline was designed to last 50 years. It's currently 65 years old and threatening the Great Lakes system. I would fight to have this pipeline rehabbed or replaced in conjunction with the PPC pipeline plan. \u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\nI'm not your average politician. I hate politicians. They promise the world but live up to nothing. I can't promise you that I can fix everything but I can promise I will fight for us to be heard not ignored like we have been in previous governments.\nThe great thing about the PPC is that they allow their candidates to share their personal opinions, and that is something I am eager to do for Canadians.\u00a0I grew up facing many adversities that I was able to overcome. Unfortunately, not everyone who faces these adversities thrives.\nI'm here to fight for all people: those with families to take care of, those who need support, and those who struggle with daily life in Canada today. It should not be this difficult to get ahead in a country like Canada.\nParty's website\n1. What is the top issue facing your riding right now and how would you address it?\u00a0\nThe pressing need facing people in this riding, as across the country, is to have the power to make the decisions which affect our lives. This includes, importantly, how we are governed.\u00a0\nWorking people can and should reject the path of dividing themselves behind the different cartel parties and their promises, which represent the narrow concerns of the rich minority to reap the benefits of robbing the state treasury, resources and labour of Canadians.\u00a0\nSpeaking out on the conditions of work and life and discussing solutions to the problems people face cuts through the shenanigans of the cartel parties, which are trying to keep working people passive observers of their drama within this obsolete system that brings elites to power to \"represent\" the people, speak in their name and rule over them.\u00a0\nIn this election, working people can embark on a new path to serve our own interests by exercising direct control over the decisions we take and speaking in our own name. This includes, importantly, what to do in the 2019 election itself.\u00a0\nThe Marxist-Leninist Party is making our bulletin, Renewal Update, available to workers, women and youth as a forum through which to have their voices heard.\u00a0\n2. People are concerned about the cost of living and the future of the economy. What will you do personally to address this if you become an MP?\u00a0\nThe economic, social and political rights of the people, which belong to all by virtue of being human, must be recognized and guaranteed.\u00a0\nCanada is a modern society where people rely on society for their existence, but the rights of many are being violated. More than a few working people in the riding have experienced being laid off, out-sourced or downsized. Their fate has been decided by those who control the means of production. Most often, the shuttering of plants serves narrow private interests, many times they are interests that are outside the community and even outside Canada.\u00a0\nWorking people need to have a say in the direction of the economy. It is the working people who must control their means of production and distribution for the good of all, to meet and guarantee their economic, social and political rights and well-being.\u00a0\nAs well, a new direction is required for the economy \u2014 one that stops paying the rich and increases funding for social programs. Such a society will serve the interests of working people and their families, and it will also defend the interests of all.\u00a0\n3. The environment and climate change are top concerns for many. What do you want to see the government do to address those concerns?\u00a0\nIn Canada, as internationally, measures must be taken to overcome the destructive effects of climate change and end the pernicious practices of the monopolies and oligopolies such as fracking, clear cutting, detrimental mining methods, contamination of lakes and oceans, the privatization of water, and fraudulent environmental assessments.\u00a0\nAll over the world progress on this is being made on the basis of the peoples' struggles which restrict and successfully deprive the monopolies and oligopolies and governments in their service of their ability to pollute, destroy, super-exploit, trample on the sovereign rights of Indigenous peoples, and wage war for self-serving aims.\u00a0\nThe MLPC's call to humanize the natural and social environment requires that the peoples of the world, not the rich, are able to control the decisions which affect their lives and life on planet earth.\u00a0\nIt also requires an anti-war government that will end Canada's participation in all military alliances with the U.S., including NATO and NORAD, U.S.-led wars of aggression and occupation, and the U.S. war industry \u2014 which is the biggest polluter in the world. The U.S. Department of Defense has the highest fossil fuel use of any government body in the world.\u00a0\n4. What do people need to know about you as an individual?\u00a0\nAs a woman and a worker I speak out in my own name in defence of my rights, and the rights of all. I have participated for many years, as a member of the MLPC, in the work for people's empowerment, as well as in many actions of the people against the anti-social offensive, in Ontario and nationally.\u00a0\nExperience tells me that the lack of decision-making power is the problem working people and others always bump up against. We are expected to settle for \"influencing\" the decision-makers, empowering others to make decisions for us.\u00a0\nThe most crucial new arrangement is for people to establish their own political organization that enables them to work out their own stands and speak, independent of the cartel parties and the narrow private interests of the financial oligarchy they serve.\u00a0\nLet us speak out against social irresponsibility, nation-wrecking, environmental degradation and preparations for war. Let us oppose the fast-talk of the ruling elite that seeks to justify making the rich richer in the name of the middle class \"getting ahead\" or \"choosing forward\" in order to receive a greater piece of the social product the working people themselves produce and should control. Empower yourself now.\u00a0\nParty's website\nCBC Kitchener-Waterloo has attempted to contact this candidate through the party but has yet to receive any response.

And despite a list of problems awaiting attention, including most immediately a rail strike that if left unresolved will soon begin to do long-term damage in numerous\u00a0sectors, the country continues to have many, if\u00a0poorly distributed,\u00a0advantages.\nBut however Canada deals with its internal problems it must do so in the context of a global economy that continues to struggle.\nOf course when\u00a0scrying the economic future, everyone has a different crystal ball.\u00a0Among those who sounded a less optimistic note at the end of last week was Laurence Boone, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, often seen as the rich countries' economic think-tank.\n\"The outlook for the global economy is worrying and policy-makers should be worried,\" Boone, ominously, began her video presentation on the OECD's latest outlook with the less-than-stirring title\u00a0Weak trade and investment threaten long-term growth.\nLike the Bank of Canada's Stephen Poloz, Boone believes the disruption in global trade, caused at least partly by U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to get what he saw as a better deal, has done long-term damage. Repeated\u00a0and continuing\u00a0trade scares\u00a0have meant businesses that would otherwise have borrowed at current bargain rates to invest\u00a0have put off those decisions due to uncertainty.\nBoone's solution is a new round of fiscal spending by governments\u00a0on things like \"21st-century\u00a0infrastucture,\" partly to replace that private sector investment but intended\u00a0also to reduce uncertainty enough so that businesses once again feel they can borrow to expand with confidence.\n\"We can escape long-term stagnation by combining social reforms with targeted spending and tax policies, at lower interest rates, and raise investment confidence,\" said Boone in a call for concerted action by global governments. \"But everyone must recognize that the time to turn the tide is now.\"\nA more optimistic outlook came in market analysis from the London Financial Times\u00a0in an attempt to explain the recent surge in stocks, that included record highs for Canada's main index,\u00a0and an increase in short-term bond earnings quite different from the inverted yields so recently considered a recession warning flag.\nThings are looking up says FT. <a href=\"https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw\">https://t.co/5zB29PyCIw</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2VZXIkLCpw\">pic.twitter.com/2VZXIkLCpw</a>\nThe idea is that unlike concerns from people like Boone, and similar gloom from the IMF and World Bank, which are based on data that has already been collected, markets act as an\u00a0indicator of future expectations as traders load up in anticipation of better returns ahead.\nBut even after assembling a collection of data, including a chart that shows a gentle upturn in the economic outlook for major world economies including Canada, their conclusions are\u00a0less than enthusiastic.\n\"So far\u00a0the evidence suggests the slide in the global economy is coming to an end, but the pace of recovery is still expected to be weak,\" said the FT analysis.\nThe feeling is echoed in the deliberations released last week of the U.S. central bank in the run-up to its latest interest rate move where Fed chair Jerome Powell assured us this was his last cut for a while. Unless of course the economy weakens again, possibly due to a stalemate in the trade talks between the U.S. and China.\nSuch conditional parsing is always the way of economic forecasts. The ability of\u00a0markets, or any forecaster,\u00a0to tell us with reliability what is around the corner is far from certain.\nIn the meantime, the new cabinet is getting plenty of advice over how to squeeze the most out of an uncertain economy.\nFrom\u00a0Margaret McCuaig-Johnston at the Macdonald-Laurier\u00a0Institute comes the advice that Canada must make it a priority to reset its own trade and political relationship with China, including making a concerted effort to diversify Canada's Asian trade.\u00a0From David Parkinson at the Globe and Mail, that reappointed finance minister Bill Morneau must overhaul the tax code.\nAt a speech to the Ontario Securities Commission billed as a \"fireside chat,\" the Bank of Canada's Poloz\u00a0hinted at\u00a0two aspirations for his political masters\u00a0that may end up in conflict. One was a liberalization\u00a0in Canadian interprovincial trade, and the other a new awareness of how climate change represents a risk to the financial system.\nBut while the government will have its work cut out for it in synthesizing its perceived election mandate to reduce carbon with the oil-producing regions'\u00a0insistence on increasing the export of carbon fuels, it will do so with a few ace cards in its hand.\nOne is the strong consumer economy both in the U.S. and here at home prompted by job and wage growth that has helped allow North Americans to live in a bubble of relative prosperity.\nLast week the Canadian Federation of Independent Business revealed that despite a steady drip of immigration, more than 430,000 jobs have gone unfilled in the Canadian private sector. Statistics Canada provides its own\u00a0jobs update Dec. 6.\nA second is core inflation\u00a0\u2014 the measure of price rises with volatile sectors removed\u00a0\u2014 of more than two per cent that remains the envy of rich countries around the world, including the United States, meaning that Canada can reserve interest rate cuts for when the economy really needs them.\nAnd finally, despite the social complications it creates, Canada has the advantage of\u00a0a seemingly insatiable demand for housing that has led to a resurgent building boom that, so long as the economy continues to\u00a0inch\u00a0ahead, shows no sign of ending.\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": "James Dunne", "title": "Love them or hate them, research offers financial case for big city bike lanes", "description": "Beyond health and environmental benefits, studies indicate bike lanes boost city businesses", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/biking-lanes-business-health-1.5165954", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5166013.1559874471!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bike-signal.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jun 08, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-06-08T16:44:18.123Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Bike lanes come with their share of claims and controversies; beloved by some and\u00a0bemoaned by others.\nWith bike month being marked through June, and recent bike lane announcements in Canadian cities, a review of academic and business research suggests five key economic benefits associated with bike lanes in urban centres.\nThe research is focused on cities with existing bike lane networks and does not cover the impact of reduced lanes for\u00a0drivers or\u00a0examine bike lanes in suburban settings, where bike commuting is\u00a0less common.\u00a0\nWhile hailed for keeping cyclists safe, the cost of installing protected\u00a0bike lanes, their location and their impact on businesses remain contested topics. \u00a0\u00a0\nBeyond claims about safety, health care costs and environmental benefits made in favour of cycling infrastructure, supporters are leveraging financial arguments to support the business case for bike lanes.\nIn recent years, New York City has aggressively expanded its network of protected bike lanes. \u00a0\nThe city has been tracking\u00a0the impacts of the lanes on businesses. One 2012 study following the construction of a bike lane on 9th Avenue, found local businesses saw an increase in retail sales of up to 49 per cent,\u00a0compared to a three per cent\u00a0increase in the rest of Manhattan. \u00a0\nA broader evaluation of bike lanes in the Big Apple conducted by municipal officials in 2014\u00a0indicated that streets with protected bike lanes experienced retail sales spike by up to\u00a024 per cent compared to streets\u00a0without protected lanes.\nIn Salt Lake City,\u00a02015 sales tax statistics also noted a\u00a0sales bump with new bike lanes.\u00a0\nPositive results have been seen in San Francisco too;\u00a0after bike lanes and wider sidewalks were installed, two-thirds of merchants reported that increased levels of bicycling and walking improved business,\u00a0only four per cent said the changes hurt sales. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn Toronto, 2017 research into business activity and protected bike lanes on the downtown artery Bloor Street found \"a positive or at least neutral\" impact, with most merchants reporting more customers after the lanes were installed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn contrast, a\u00a0study in Vancouver showed a change in the style of bike lanes on one street had a negative impact on businesses there\u00a0though\u00a0the analysis was limited to a short time period.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nBike lanes are believed to boost sales for some retailers because several studies have shown cyclists are good customers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn France, a recent study covering six\u00a0cities found that cyclists spend more money per week in shops than drivers. Research from Copenhagen has shown similar results.\nCloser to home, a 2012 study from Oregon found that in the city of Portland people who biked to a bar, restaurant or convenience store spent 24 per cent\u00a0more per month than those who drove. The cyclists spent more than drivers because they visited merchants more often.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe author of that study suggests cyclists have more disposable income because they spend less money on auto repairs, gas, insurance, and car payments.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the same data shows that for trips to the supermarket, bikers didn't keep up with drivers on overall spending.\u00a0\u00a0\nA report from a real estate firm this month ranking Canadian cities on a 'Liveability Index\" included access to bike lanes as a key factor in making\u00a0a city attractive.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nIn the U.S., several academic studies have tried to quantify what close proximity to bike infrastructure means for\u00a0property values. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to a 2004 study in Indianapolis, Ind.,\u00a0homes within one\u00a0kilometre from the city's Monon Trail were selling for about 11 per cent\u00a0more than similar homes farther away.\nA 2006 University of Delaware paper looking at past research from across the U.S. concluded\u00a0that \"the majority of studies indicate that the presence of a bike path/trail either increases property values and ease of sale slightly or has no effect.\"\nThe papers said Delaware properties within 50 metres of bike paths had a value at least $8,800 greater than those farther away, and even more \"when controlled for specific variables.\"\nThat prospect for a premium price on homes with easy access to bike lanes or paths is not welcomed by everyone. Some observers point to bike lanes as a tool of gentrification that help create housing affordability issues.\nAnother unique factor some use\u00a0in favour of bike lanes actually comes out of critiques against them:\u00a0their cost.\nA Canadian report\u00a0from 2014 noted that the price for installing a bike lane can range from as low as $20,000 per/ km\u00a0for a painted lane to $1.2 million per/km if a road needs to be widened.\u00a0\nA 2011 U.S. study analyzing 58 projects in 11 different cities found that for every million dollars spent cycling infrastructure projects created 11.4 local jobs compared to 7.8 jobs for road-only projects. \u00a0\nThe study says a bike lane \"which requires a great deal of planning and design will generate more jobs for a given level of spending,\" than a road alone, employing more construction workers and engineers while utilizing less materials. \u00a0\u00a0\nNonetheless, bike lane budgets can still produce bad news for local leaders even in bike friendly cities. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCelebrity academic and urban planner Richard Florida of the University of Toronto asserts that many members of the so-called creative class\u00a0of workers are bikers. \u00a0\nHe's argued in editorials that cities seeking to attract these valuable workers should build bike lanes and noted that cities with a higher number of bicycle commuters also tend to have higher wages. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross North America, cities are investing in bike lanes, with\u00a0some mayors saying luring high tech workers and companies is part of their motivation.\nOver two\u00a0terms, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel poured millions into bike lanes, winning the best bike city in America title. While opening new bike lanes in 2012 he said \"you cannot be for a startup, high-tech economy and not be pro-bike.\" \u00a0\nOutside of health and environmental claims, there are also business arguments related to bike lanes for their role in helping combat\u00a0traffic congestion, and freeing up parking space for development.\nStill, there's\u00a0vocal opposition.\nLawrence Solomon, an environmentalist\u00a0and energy policy researcher once advocated in favour of bike lanes. Now, he rails against them.\nAnd just two\u00a0years ago, academics in New Zealand produced an international study on the \"bikelash\"\u00a0trend, against cycling infrastructure.\u00a0\n"}, {"author": "Richard White", "title": "Calgary lags behind on transit-oriented development", "description": "Other cities, like Vancouver, are doing much more to link vibrant communities to public transit", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-transit-oriented-development-tod-vancouver-1.5172225", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5172408.1569890402!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oakridge-centre-development.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 05, 2019 5:00 AM MT", "2019-12-05T15:05:40.643Z"], "source": null, "content": "Originally published on June 13, 2019.\nOne of the things I was most impressed with during my month-long visit to Vancouver earlier this year was the amazing transit-oriented development (TOD) that has happened in that city over the past 15 years.\nIt got me thinking that, if the future of urban living in North American cities is linked to creating vibrant, dense communities next to LRT stations, why isn't Calgary fast-tracking TOD development next to existing LRT\u00a0stations, rather than expanding the LRT to the north and southeast\u00a0edges of the city?\nTransit-oriented development (TOD) is commonly defined as high-density, mixed-use development within a 15-minute walk of a transit station. TOD provides a range of benefits including increased transit ridership, reduced regional congestion and pollution, and healthier, more walkable neighbourhoods.\nTOD neighbourhoods have a mix of affordable and market-rate housing, as well as a mix of commercial amenities: grocers, restaurants, cafes, shops, fitness studios and professional services.\nI was gobsmacked by the numerous highrise residential towers next to the Metrotown SkyTrain station and Metrotown Mall in Burnaby. I couldn't help but wonder why there hasn't been major residential development next to Calgary's Chinook and Anderson LRT stations, as they have many of\u00a0the same conditions as Metrotown. Both have major malls and major roads nearby. The Metrotown SkyTrain didn't open until 1985, while Chinook and Anderson opened in 1981.\nThe more I rode Vancouver's SkyTrain, the more impressed I was with how almost every station is surrounded not only by mid-rise\u00a0and highrise residential, but with grocery stores and other amenities to create an urban village.\nBy clustering a large share of the region's population, employment growth, new major public spaces, community facilities and cultural amenities in locations well served by public transit, Vancouver has become a leader in the development of walkable, transit-oriented communities.\nMetro Vancouver has nine major town centres and 18 smaller ones, each with its own LRT station.\nRecently, the Vancouver website Daily Hive\u00a0published a list of 21 mega transit-oriented developments in the works for the Lower Mainland. These are not just one or two towers next to an LRT station, but entire\u00a0new communities like Calgary's East Village, University District and Currie. Some of the plans are so big they include four separate LRT Stations.\nWhile Calgary has its share of 21st\u00a0century TOD happening \u2014 Bridgeland, East Village, Brentwood and Dalhousie \u2014 we are lagging behind cities like Vancouver and Portland, which built their LRT systems after ours.\nUpon arriving home, I contacted several planners and developers to try to understand why Calgary hasn't seen more TOD development.\nI was especially curious why TOD along the south leg \u2014 Chinook, Anderson, Stampede Park, Manchester (39th\u00a0Avenue S.E.) \u2014 hasn't happened, given they are all surrounded by underutilized land, perfect for mixed-use TOD development.\nI first met with David Couroux, the City of Calgary's TOD planner, and he informed me that the biggest barrier to TOD development in Calgary is funding for the infrastructure needed to undertake it, everything from upgrading water and sewer systems, improving sidewalks, creating new parks and integrating bus services with trains to create transit hubs.\nHe said with a smile, \"Creating policy and plans is cheap;\u00a0it is the implementation that is expensive.\"\nIndeed, the city often gets bogged down in creating endless policy and plans that frequently act as a barrier to development, instead of an incentive.\nThat being said, Couroux noted Calgary has seen significant new TOD development over the past 15 years.\nHe pointed out that in 2009, the city approved the Hillhurst Sunnyside ARP Transit Oriented Development Plan\u00a0and, almost immediately, mid-rise developments began to happen:\u00a0St. John's on Tenth, Ven, Pixel, Lido and Kensington, with the new Memorial Drive and Annex condos now under construction and Theodore being marketed.\nCouroux thinks The Bridges is perhaps the best example of TOD in Calgary.\nIt has proceeded slowly but steadily, and there are only two or three parcels of land left to develop. It features all the characteristics of TOD one would expect:\u00a0higher density, mixed-use development, a pedestrian focus to the mobility network, parks, a main street and an upgraded public realm.\nAnderson station remains an unrealized opportunity, as do other south line station areas, such as Heritage and Southland. The requirement to maintain park-and-ride spaces adds significant costs to the redevelopment of these sites for TOD,\u00a0because they would need to be accommodated by expensive underground parkades.\nCouroux is optimistic that redevelopment around Brentwood and Dalhousie stations and long-awaited projects at Anderson and Heritage stations will get off the ground in the near future.\nJoe Starkman, the president of Knightsbridge Homes, expressed in a telephone chat his frustration with the city's focus on creating plans and policy\u00a0rather than implementation.\nStarkman, who is responsible for the playful yellow, red and green condo towers at the Brentwood station, says he wouldn't do TOD again. Why? Because it takes too long to get approvals \u2014 it took four years and $1 million to get University Village approved.\nHe said he wouldn't go to the city for a \"rezoning\" today\u00a0as it is too costly, and there is too much uncertainty when it comes to getting plans approved.\nHe pointed out that Westbrook\u00a0station's \"Request For Proposals\" was 400 pages long, making it too arduous to review and understand.\nIn his opinion, the red tape at city hall is getting worse, not better. Starkman is also frustrated by what he calls the city's double talk.\n\"The city claims to want more density near transit corridors, but when a developer comes to them with a proposal, instead of being fast-tracked, it gets bogged down in endless reviews and community engagement,\" he said.\n\"It is often city roads and water engineers who are barriers to TOD development, not the planners,\" he added.\nOther developers have shared similar experiences with me over the years.\nI then contacted Gary Andrishak, the director of the IBI Group in Vancouver, who has over 30 years experience in TOD planning in North America, to get his insights into Calgary's TOD history and future.\nGiven that he has been involved in the development of many of Calgary's TOD plans (including the new Green Line), he knows our situation well.\nAndrishak was indeed insightful and forthright in his comments.\nHe said upfront that comparing Calgary to Vancouver is unfair, as \"Vancouver is as good as it gets when it comes to TOD development in North America, and it is a very different city than Calgary.\n\"A\u00a0city that can sprawl, will sprawl,\" he added \u2014 which is Calgary's problem, as there are no barriers to sprawl, like the ocean or mountains in Vancouver.\nOne of the biggest failures in Calgary, he said, is that council hasn't linked transportation and land use planning.\nFor example, all of the land along transit corridors and near LRT stations should be zoned for mixed-use, multi-family development to streamline TOD development.\nHe also suggested that the city has a history of treating rapid public transit as a utility\u00a0rather than \"the glue that can hold a city together. Calgary lost a generation of TOD over cities like Portland, who saw the synergies of building density adjacent to transit back in the '90s.\"\nOne of the other barriers to good TOD development in Calgary is the fact that too much TOD development is still negotiated between city councillors and developers, shutting out the planners, which leads to complications later.\nHe also noted most of Calgary's TOD developments are not well designed when it comes to the mix of uses and the incorporation of mid-rise buildings.\nAndrishak thinks Calgary has a tendency \"to go too big, too quickly.\" He said that in Vancouver, developers understand the importance of investing in quality, usable public realms that create a more attractive, walkable pedestrian experience;\u00a0that is not the case for most developments in Calgary.\nWith respect to the south leg of the LRT, Andrishak thinks the decision to use the Canadian Pacific Railway\u00a0right-of-way has resulted in making TOD development difficult, as people simply don't want to live next to heavy rail lines due to noise and safety concerns.\nSimilarly, the decision to run much of the northwest leg of the LRT up the middle of Crowchild Trail is a barrier, as you need to be able to build right up to the station to have good TOD development. Building LRT lines next to or in the middle of a freeway just doesn't work, in Andrishak's experience.\n\"The car \u2014\u00a0no, make that the pickup truck \u2014 is still king in Calgary,\" noted Andrishak.\u00a0\"Calgary has one foot in the city and one in the country; there is still lots of room to grow. You can still see the downtown from the edge of the city, so people think, 'What's the problem?'\"\nNot only do Calgarians love their cars and pickups but they also love home ownership and living in single-family homes.\nA 2018 survey by Mustel Group for Sotheby's International Realty Canada found \"the preference for single-family home ownership (91%) is higher in Calgary than in any other metropolitan area in Canada. In addition, the rate of single-family home ownership is significantly higher than any other city at 74% as the price of home ownership is more accessible in Calgary than other major cities.\"\nObviously, one of the key factors driving the incredible demand for new condos in Vancouver is the high cost of single-family homes, a situation that is not mirrored in Calgary.\nThat same Sotheby's study found 78 per cent of Metro Vancouver's young families reported they would like to own a single-family home; however, only 46 per cent actually bought a detached house, with 27 per cent buying a townhome and 27 per cent a condo. The survey also found that 55 per cent of those who don't own a single-family home today have given up any plans to do so.\nThe fact Calgary has the highest home ownership of any major city in Canada and the most affordable single-family home prices means our market for TOD development, which is exclusively mid- to high-rise multi-family residential, is smaller than in any major city in Canada.\nStill, I can't help but wonder if it would be better for municipal, provincial and federal governments to fund infill projects at LRT stations in major cities, instead of constructing new LRT lines.\nRather than taking the LRT out to the edges of Calgary, as we are about to do again with the Green Line, encouraging more development in places like Airdrie, Cochrane and Okotoks and more new edge communities in the city, wouldn't it be better if we invested in the infrastructure needed to create more housing where we already have LRT and bus service?\nThis column is an opinion.

It's projected to fall to $11.6 billion by 2024-2025, with the size of the debt relative to the economy remaining flat for the next few years.\nIn a news conference on Parliament Hill, Morneau\u00a0defended the plan to carry ongoing deficits, saying it's necessary to ensure Canadians reap the benefits of a strong economy, including the residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador who are experiencing economic anxieties.\n\"We know that in order to ensure we continue on this positive trajectory, the strong economy that we've seen, the very strong employment numbers, that we should be continuing to invest at an appropriate level, and that's what we are doing with this economic and fiscal update and with the campaign that we ran on,\" he said.\nThe update shows an increase of nearly $10 billion in spending since the spring budget, including nearly $5 billion for employee pension and benefits adjustments, nearly $2 billion for a new revenue agreement on the Hibernia oil project in Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0and\u00a0millions in compensation for dairy farmers harmed by new trade deals.\nThe government announced a $1.75-billion compensation package for dairy farmers in August, of which $345 million was to be paid out in the first year.\nSome of the government's spending is offset by $1.7 billion in increased tax revenue.\nNearly 400,000 new jobs have been created so far in 2019 \u2014 Canada's\u00a0strongest rate of growth since 2007, according to the Department of Finance.\nBut not all parts of the country are experiencing the benefits of that growth;\u00a0Canada's oil-producing provinces are\u00a0still feeling the pinch.\n\"Insufficient export pipeline infrastructure is reducing Canadian crude oil and natural gas prices, meaning lower profits for producers, reduced investment within the industry, fewer good, well-paying jobs for Canadian workers and lost revenues at all levels of government,\" the report reads.\n\"These challenges are expected to persist until major projects, such as the Trans Mountain and LNG Canada (pipelines), are completed.\"\nThe economic update also earmarks an extra $69 million for compensation payments to provinces for costs associated with asylum seekers entering the country outside of official border points, such as interim housing, social assistance and education.\nThe update also points to the positive impact of immigration on the country's economy. Since 2015, immigrants have accounted for three-quarters of population growth, resulting in Canada's population growing at its fastest pace in 20 years, and much faster than that of the other G7 economies.\nAsked if the government is prepared to respond to a possible recession, Morneau said it is prepared \"for all eventualities.\"\n\"We already have the strongest balance sheet among G7 countries, we have the lowest level of debt as a function of our economy and what we're projecting is that we're going to be able to reduce that level of debt as a function of our economy, down to 29 per cent during the forecast horizon,\" he said.\nConservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre rejected Morneau's positive outlook, saying that Canada's economic performance lags behind other G7 countries. He said the government is responding to economic challenges by piling up debt, adding \"devastating\" red tape and creating obstacles to building major projects.\n\"What we're facing now is the prospect of a made-in-Canada recession,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"When we went into the last downturn in 2008, Canada led the pack. We were the last into the recession\u00a0and the first out. It looks like this time that Canada could be in the worst position of our competitors going into the troubled waters ahead.\"\nNDP finance critic Peter Julian said he was \"profoundly disappointed\" by the update.\n\"It's surprising how weak this economic update is when you contrast it with how readily the Liberal majority government was willing to give billions of dollars to Canada's biggest corporations when they were in power,\" he said.\n\"Now in a minority Parliament they should be thinking about regular families and communities and they seem to be ignoring that.\"\nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce is also disappointed with the update, noting that it does little to help the businesses that are the drivers of the economy. Chief economist Trevin Stratton said the update makes deficits an\" enduring fixture\" of the fiscal plan and leaves untenable levels of debt to future generations.\n\"Our perpetual structural deficit will put Canada in a difficult position to use fiscal stimulus should it be required in the event of a widely expected global downturn. Should a foul economic wind blow at anytime in the next four\u00a0years, this fiscal house of cards will inevitably fall,\" he said in a statement.\nEconomic growth: GDP growth after inflation projected to be 1.7 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2020, second only to the U.S. in the G7 \u2014 no change from the spring budget. Outside experts are not predicting a recession.\nJobs: Despite a loss of 71,000 jobs in November, 2019 has recorded the highest number of jobs added this decade \u2014 nearly 400,000.\nDeficit: Projected to be $26.6 billion (including $1.5 billion for \"risk\") \u2014 a jump of $6.8 billion from the spring budget mostly due to pension and benefit adjustments, a new revenue agreement with Newfoundland and Labrador on Hibernia, compensation for dairy and canola farmers and the recently passed tax cut. Higher expenses were offset by $1.7 billion in higher tax revenues.\nDebt: The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise slightly to 31 per cent for 2019-20 and then fall again in 2021-22.\n"}, {"author": "Chris Hall", "title": "Get ready for an unruly House of Commons divided along regional fault lines", "description": "Election 2019 managed to deepen Canada's east-west, rural-urban divides in an alarming way", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-liberal-2019-election-1.5330092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330106.1571760401!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20191002.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 22, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-22T13:15:16.715Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau and the Liberals shook off a lacklustre campaign and his own uneven performance on the hustings to win another mandate.

It worked for Stephen Harper in the 2006-2011 period\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but at the time, he was benefiting from disarray in the Liberal Party.\nTrudeau doesn't\u00a0appear to enjoy a similar advantage. Scheer may well face some Conservative criticism for his own uneven performance in this campaign\u00a0\u2014 but in his concession speech, he issued a clear warning.\n\"Tonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\" he said.\u00a0\"And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\"\nNew Democrats hold the balance of power. Jagmeet Singh spoke to Trudeau last night but didn't divulge what they talked about.\nBut Singh set out what he called six urgent priorities during the campaign \u2014 things his party wants the next government to tackle.\u00a0\nTopping the list are a single-payer, universal pharmacare program\u00a0and\u00a0more ambitious carbon emissions reduction targets. So far, the Liberals haven't committed to anything (there is more common ground between the two parties\u00a0on the need to build affordable housing).\nOne hurdle to co-operation between the Liberals and New Democrats may be insurmountable. Both the NDP and Greens are adamantly opposed to the expansion of the Trans-Mountain Pipeline. Will that be part of the price for Singh's co-operation?\n\"These are the priorities of people that New Democrats will put at the heart of the conversations that we are going to have in the days and weeks to come,\" Singh told supporters in Burnaby.\u00a0\"And if the other parties work with us, we have an incredible opportunity to make the lives of all Canadians so much better.\"\nIt's not clear when Trudeau and Singh will talk, or what the prime minister will offer in return for NDP support as he pursues his next agenda in a divided Parliament and a divided country.\nMinority governments can produce big things in Canada.\u00a0Under Lester B. Pearson in the 1960s,\u00a0the Liberals worked with the New Democrats to introduce medicare and the Canada Pension Plan.\nStephen Harper's Conservatives formed two minority governments and, at the insistence of his finance minister Jim Flaherty, embarked on a massive program of stimulus spending and tax cuts that took Canada through\u00a0a global recession and allowed this country to emerge more quickly and in better shape from the downturn than other advanced economies.\nIt's possible climate change and universal pharmacare might be the issues that get this new minority government to introduce some\u00a0lasting initiatives.\nFor now, common ground remains elusive. And nothing any of the leaders said in the wee hours of this morning suggests unity is high on their list of priorities.\n"}, {"author": "Chris Hall", "title": "Get ready for an unruly House of Commons divided along regional fault lines", "description": "Election 2019 managed to deepen Canada's east-west, rural-urban divides in an alarming way", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-liberal-2019-election-1.5330092", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330106.1571760401!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fedelxn-liberals-20191002.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 22, 2019 5:00 AM ET", "2019-10-22T13:15:16.715Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Justin Trudeau and the Liberals shook off a lacklustre campaign and his own uneven performance on the hustings to win another mandate.

It worked for Stephen Harper in the 2006-2011 period\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but at the time, he was benefiting from disarray in the Liberal Party.\nTrudeau doesn't\u00a0appear to enjoy a similar advantage. Scheer may well face some Conservative criticism for his own uneven performance in this campaign\u00a0\u2014 but in his concession speech, he issued a clear warning.\n\"Tonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\" he said.\u00a0\"And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\"\nNew Democrats hold the balance of power. Jagmeet Singh spoke to Trudeau last night but didn't divulge what they talked about.\nBut Singh set out what he called six urgent priorities during the campaign \u2014 things his party wants the next government to tackle.\u00a0\nTopping the list are a single-payer, universal pharmacare program\u00a0and\u00a0more ambitious carbon emissions reduction targets. So far, the Liberals haven't committed to anything (there is more common ground between the two parties\u00a0on the need to build affordable housing).\nOne hurdle to co-operation between the Liberals and New Democrats may be insurmountable. Both the NDP and Greens are adamantly opposed to the expansion of the Trans-Mountain Pipeline. Will that be part of the price for Singh's co-operation?\n\"These are the priorities of people that New Democrats will put at the heart of the conversations that we are going to have in the days and weeks to come,\" Singh told supporters in Burnaby.\u00a0\"And if the other parties work with us, we have an incredible opportunity to make the lives of all Canadians so much better.\"\nIt's not clear when Trudeau and Singh will talk, or what the prime minister will offer in return for NDP support as he pursues his next agenda in a divided Parliament and a divided country.\nMinority governments can produce big things in Canada.\u00a0Under Lester B. Pearson in the 1960s,\u00a0the Liberals worked with the New Democrats to introduce medicare and the Canada Pension Plan.\nStephen Harper's Conservatives formed two minority governments and, at the insistence of his finance minister Jim Flaherty, embarked on a massive program of stimulus spending and tax cuts that took Canada through\u00a0a global recession and allowed this country to emerge more quickly and in better shape from the downturn than other advanced economies.\nIt's possible climate change and universal pharmacare might be the issues that get this new minority government to introduce some\u00a0lasting initiatives.\nFor now, common ground remains elusive. And nothing any of the leaders said in the wee hours of this morning suggests unity is high on their list of priorities.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and around the world on March 17", "description": "Ontario, Alberta and B.C. declare emergency as Trudeau pledges relief for Canadians", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-march-17-covid19-canada-world-1.5499998", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5500588.1584471020!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-assessment-centre.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 17, 2020 7:16 AM ET", "2020-03-20T13:52:09.844Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nAs the world continued to ramp up its responses\u00a0to the COVID-19 pandemic on Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated that his government will provide financial help for Canadians abroad who are trying to return home.\nBut despite praising\u00a0Ontario Premier Doug Ford's declaration of a state of emergency\u00a0\u2014 a move which was soon followed by Alberta and B.C. declaring a public health emergencies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Trudeau said there is no reason to do so federally at this time.\nInstead, Ottawa will look at what other measures can be introduced, Trudeau said, speaking to reporters outside his residence in Ottawa, where he is in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus that causes the fast-spreading COVID-19 respiratory illness.\nCBC News-Radio Canada has learned that will include $25B\u00a0to help individuals and businesses.\u00a0\n\"People need rent money and groceries.

Through Reheart, users can list clothes for rent for up to 50 per cent of the profits, and peruse its online catalogue for items they might wish to rent themselves.\nThe aim is to help reduce the environmental damage of fast fashion by getting women to purchase less clothing overall, while at the same time empowering them to save money through renting and to profit off lending out their own garments to others.\u00a0\nReheart is tapping into a huge potential inventory.\u00a0\u00a0\nBusiness analysts report clothing production has doubled since 2000 and in 2014 topped 100 billion garments a year for the first time.\u00a0In context, that means almost 14 new pieces of clothing for every person on the planet.\u00a0\nReheart is launching with about 2,500 registered users and an inventory of more than 1,200 items that Belegrinis estimates have a total retail value of more than $500,000.\nShe expects that inventory to grow quickly. According to Greenpeace, 40 per cent\u00a0of the clothes people own in developed countries\u00a0is\u00a0barely used or never worn.\nCurrently the company accepts high quality, gently used items, including dresses, gowns, blazers, skirts, shirts, coats, bags and accessories.\u00a0\u00a0\nReheart has found Items that are less than one year old and cost $300 at full retail price do best,\nLenders send their rental items to Toronto for storage and Reheart handles all shipping and cleaning logistics because Belegrinis said the business is too time-sensitive to rely on direct peer-to-peer transactions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMost of Reheart's customer base is in the Greater Toronto Area and from ages 20 to 35. New users have signed on from\u00a0Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver and the company ships across Canada.\u00a0\n\"It didn't feel weird\" signing up to lend clothes to Reheart,\u00a0said Risham Najeeb, a\u00a022-year-old account executive who works in Mississauga.\n\"I was more ... like, 'Wow, why hasn't someone done this before?' \"\nNajeeb plans to lend out several outfits to Reheart later this summer, but has already listed an expensive Kate Spade purse.\u00a0\nInitially she\u00a0worried about her things being abused by renters, but Reheart says it protects lenders,\u00a0repairs damaged items\u00a0and charges customers who fail to return items with the full cost of replacing them.\u00a0\u00a0\nNajeeb was not getting much use out of her $500 purse, which is listed at $45\u00a0for a four-day rental and was popular during Reheart's test pilot phase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNajeeb said lending is about more than making money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I do personally also believe in just the message and the meaning behind this platform,\u00a0which is to reduce waste from fast fashion and just kind of make our habits in terms of fashion more sustainable.\"\nRenters can have items for four, 10 or 30 days.\u00a0\nA short-term deal is often what Roxanne Bilski is after. The Toronto model has a busy social and work calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe's worn rental outfits to more than 10 occasions in the past year. One of those outfits included a used gown for the Miss World\u00a0Canada pageant.\u00a0\u00a0\nA new dress for the preliminary competition could have cost her $1,500 or more.\u00a0Instead, she paid $80 and felt good about reusing a dress. Sending the dress back came with an added bonus.\n\"I live in small downtown condo. I don't have the closet space.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to creating clothing, business is booming.\u00a0Experts say clothing production has become a $2.4-trillion-a-year industry \u2014 up from $1 trillion a year\u00a0less than two decades ago.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne study reports that less than one per cent of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, with a truckload\u00a0of clothes being dumped into a landfill every second.\u00a0\u00a0\nNumbers like these shocked Belegrinis when she watched a documentary about the industry called The True Cost in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\nThen a business student deeply interested in social enterprise, Belegrinis decided to sell underused items in her closet that weren't appropriate to give to charity.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn early 2017, she began listing items on Facebook, Kijiji and the Letgo app. The effort failed. \"I had the worst experiences dealing with resale apps,\" said Belegrinis. She also found customers were unreliable and were looking for unreasonably low prices.\u00a0\nLater that year, she hatched the idea for her business, inspired both by the success of Rent the Runway\u00a0and an American peer-to-peer used clothing rental business called Style Lend, which started in 2013 and claims to be generating revenue from more than 50,000 users.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRecently, Reheart took over another Toronto clothing rental startup called\u00a0Boro, whose founders were giving up the business. Belegrinis hopes that merger will help her business reach a point that it could sustain itself within six months.\u00a0\nClothing rentals are another example of how the sharing economy allows people to turn their property into profit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBrands like AirBnB, VRBO, Uber, Lyft,\u00a0Turo\u00a0and Getaround are the big names in the sharing world but there's peer-to-peer bike rental,\u00a0boat rental\u00a0and RV rental,\u00a0as well as several apps for parking spots.\nBut it's not all sunshine and roses.\u00a0Sharing economy businesses can have negative impacts.\u00a0\nProf. Ming Hu of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto likes the Reheart idea, but worries about how sustainable the clothing rental model is overall. His concern is that manufacturers and retailers offering consumers tempting deals on new clothes for rent will mean that a large volume of clothing is still being produced.\u00a0\n\"As a result,\" said\u00a0Hu,\"there could be more clothes\u00a0out there\u00a0circulating in the society.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nHu points to complaints about AirBnB and VRBO reducing the supply of long-term rental housing and studies showing\u00a0Uber and Lyft increase traffic congestion as other examples of unwelcome outcomes from the sharing economy.\nBelegrinis\u00a0believes sharing clothes will work out.\u00a0\n\"A lot of who we're targeting, they just don't like to buy anymore,\" she said. \"And I think that even as the incoming generations also come into place, they'll put even more emphasis on sustainability.\"\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/keep-it-wild-keep-it-weird-vancouver-island-village-of-cumberland", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Shanifa Nasser", "title": "What will become of Toronto's Chinatown?

Though Chinatown then wasn't where we know it to be today.\nAt the time, Toronto's Chinatown was about where\u00a0city hall stands now. But eventually about\u00a0two-thirds of that land was expropriated for the municipal government building, prompting Lumb and others to try to save the remaining third.\nMany others in the Chinese community relocated\u00a0to Spadina Avenue at Dundas Street, where rent was more affordable. And a third Chinatown had sprung up in the Broadview and Gerrard area, where prices were even lower.\nToday, that first Chinatown is pretty well gone, says Chan. And the Broadview iteration, once home to about 30 Chinese restaurants, now has less than a handful.\nSpadina Avenue is now the last remaining snapshot of the Chinese community's earliest days in Toronto. And the history isn't confined to the buildings themselves.\n\"It's thriving, it's busy ... On the weekends, the grandmothers that make their own sticky rice dumplings are selling them on the corner with the vegetables that they grow in their vegetable gardens.\"\nThat in part is why Chan is optimistic.\nChinatown, she says, has always been a place of change. Most notably, there was the SARS outbreak in 2003, when an elderly woman who had travelled to Hong Kong died of the deadly virus in Toronto. Fears about the illness \"almost wiped out Chinatown,\" says Chan.\nThen there were plans for a Spadina Expressway that would have run right through the area.\nAnd of course\u00a0346 Spadina Avenue wasn't always the site of the beloved Bright Pearl. Before it was sold to a Taiwanese restaurateur in 1971, the building was home to the historic Labour Lyceum, a hub for Jewish textile workers and activism,\u00a0where in 1937, famed American labour organizer Emma Goldman once spoke.\nEven the population of Chinatown has changed over the years:\u00a0around the time of the Second World War it was largely Cantonese-speakers from Guangdong province, then there was the influx from Hong Kong, and later immigrants from China.\n\"So you could see the influence of the newer Chinese immigrants in Chinatown, we have these hand-pulled noodles and the immigrants coming from Taiwan brought us bubble tea,\" she says.\nStill, she says she applauds young people like Lam and Yee who are organizing to make sure the area doesn't disappear.\u00a0\n\"My hats off to the young people who are being vigilant and watching to make sure that what has happened to other communities doesn't happen to our Chinatown.\"\nBut while Lam and Yee are concerned about the effect of gentrification in the area, Tonny Louie, chair of the Chinatown BIA, isn't worried.\n\"I think gentrification is a good thing because new shops are coming in. And as you know, the population has grown older and at a\u00a0lot of the earlier businesses, the people are retiring so we need some new ideas and new operators,\" he says.\nBesides, he says, whereas Chinatown might have once been the singular hub for Chinese groceries and community events in Toronto, today there are thriving hubs of Chinese-owned business all over the Greater Toronto Area in places like Markham, Richmond Hill and Scarborough.\u00a0\nAnd while several of the newer businesses in the area are Chinese-owned, Yee worries their concerns are less about growing the\u00a0existing relationships and communities in the area, and more about catering to, say, the significant international student body at the nearby University of Toronto.\u00a0\n\"Usually more affluent people who come in \u2026 are not necessarily interested in the history of this space and the people who are already here, rather instead bringing a different, more affluent student business to Chinatown,\" she says.\nChinatown, she says \"is not only an important place for housing, but also culturally important as a place where people find each other, and find community and find ways to keep their roots, their family and their heritage alive.\"\nFor Chan, whose roots in the community run deep, it's impossible to ignore that the face of Chinatown is changing. The lone lion outside the vacant Metropolitan Commercial office space is a \"disrespectful\" reminder of that, she says.\nBut in order for the area to survive, she says, it will have to attract new people.\n\"Yes change is coming,\" she says. \"But Chinatown from day one has always been changing ... The flavour of it will change, but Chinatown will still be there.\"\n"}, {"author": "Don Pittis", "title": "Finding a job far from home without moving house: Don Pittis", "description": "Tech is changing how people work \u2014 and location is no longer the deciding factor", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5269934.1567610600!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/allie-turow-remote-worker-at-her-home-in-belleville-on.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Sep 05, 2019 4:00 AM ET", "2019-09-09T14:28:40.764Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When Allie Turow's partner got transferred from Saskatchewan's 15 Wing Moose Jaw to a job flying giant Hercules transport aircraft at CFB Trenton\u00a0on the shores of Lake Ontario, she faced a modern dilemma.\nAfter settling into nearby Belleville, Ont., the 25-year-old university graduate had to go out and find a new job.\n\"I was looking at the job market in Belleville and there wasn't what I wanted,\" she said.\u00a0\nShe wasn't yet thinking that she would become part of a global wave of employees\u00a0whose physical location is unconnected to the place they work.\nWhen Canadian jobs numbers come out tomorrow, they will include thousands of people like Turow, who live and\u00a0work in one city or country, but whose employer is based\u00a0far away.\nLed by the tech industry and served by high-speed internet\u00a0and digital tools,\u00a0location\u00a0of employment has begun to fade in importance as employees\u00a0interact in a virtual space instead.\u00a0\nThanks to\u00a0upstart firms like co-working office space group\u00a0WeWork and remote communication software provider Slack, the trend is becoming increasingly apparent.\nThe person on the computer at the next caf\u00e9 table to you may be working for a company in New York.\nThe exact size of the phenomenon is hard to track; Statistics Canada doesn't currently collect data on how many Canadians work remotely.\nWorking from home is by no means new. For authors, artists\u00a0and freelance journalists, it has often been the rule rather than the exception. Even before the computer age, some people with special skills found ways of using the telephone, fax and Fedex to do their job from a home office.\nBut\u00a0more and more, jobs on employment aggregators require familiarity with project management software, such as Basecamp or Slack\u00a0\u2014\u00a0created to allow remote teams working on software projects to share ideas on virtual whiteboards or to collaborate in chat rooms categorized by project or shared task.\nThe technique is ideal for teams building software, where steps must be created and physically documented by individual engineers working alone during periods of intense concentration before being vetted and tested by a larger group. Even in companies where everyone gets a desk, software engineers usually keep in touch\u00a0through a system like Slack.\nThe practice has become so widespread\u00a0that GitLab, a tech company that provides software-sharing repositories\u00a0for NASA, IBM and many others,\u00a0boasts it is 100 per cent remote.\u00a0\nGitLab\u00a0has created what it calls the \"Remote Manifesto,\" which, among other things, calls for no central location for the company, flexible working hours for everyone, \"asynchronous communication\"\u00a0and compensation measured by results rather than hours worked.\n\"The future of work is remote,\" declares Carol Teskey, a member of the company's \"people team\" in a video posted to the company's website.\nTurow's employer, Page Zero Media,\u00a0does have a physical office in Toronto.\u00a0But company founder Andrew Goodman points out that he has clients around the world, so why can't the same be true of his employees. His second and third in command\u00a0live in Vancouver and St. Louis, Mo., part of a team of 16 people, mostly scattered across Canada.\nFrom the beginning, Goodman says he was \"tolerant\" of remote workers.\u00a0But then his partner got a tenure track job at the University of New Brunswick,\u00a0so he went remote himself.\n\"It worked out very nicely,\" recalled Goodman, whose company specializes in helping advertisers get the best results in the complex world of online ad placement. \"We sold our house in Toronto. We got a cheaper and nicer house in Fredericton.\"\nNow he spends one week a month in Toronto, where he keeps a flat, working out of the company's newly acquired office space.\n\"The rest of the time I'm pretty much at my home office, with the big screen, talking on the phone, collaborating with both staff and clients\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and everyone's getting more and more used to that,\" said\u00a0Goodman.\nClearly not every job and every person is suited to remote working. Loneliness can be a factor for some;\u00a0will power to get up and get to work is essential.\u00a0But for those who can make it work, there are advantages for both employees and employers.\nOne advantage for Goodman, he says, is getting top quality staff without paying the six-figure salaries often needed to compete for workers in a high-cost city.\nFor Turow, who says she has spoken frankly with Toronto\u00a0friends in similar jobs who are not paid as well,\u00a0her comfortable, modern house would\u00a0be unaffordable in Canada's largest city.\n\"I already end up financially better off,\" she said.\u00a0And trips twice a month into the city for \"office days\" gives her a chance to catch up with friends.\nBut just as Goodman looked outside Toronto for talent, U.S. tech giants are discovering the advantages of remote workers in Canada. Some\u00a0American media\u00a0reports have pointed to cities like San Francisco as examples of places that are becoming less attractive to work, when sky-high salaries are swallowed up by the price of housing.\nA similar consideration prompted\u00a0Steph Simpson to ask her Vancouver employer, Lorax Environmental Services, if she could work remotely from\u00a0Calgary instead.\n\"My husband wasn't loving his job at the time,\" she said.\u00a0And unlike Vancouver,\u00a0Calgary was a place they felt they could afford to raise kids.\nThe company approved the plan and nine years later, Simpson is still with the same employer, saying the scheme has worked well.\nThe main\u00a0advantages and disadvantages? For her, they are one and\u00a0the same.\n\"I'm home for my kids and I'm able to flex around my husband, who's a shift worker,\" said Simpson. \"But that's also a disadvantage because I'm the one who's always flexing.\"\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bank of Canada holds interest rate steady at 1.75%, citing trade tensions", "description": "Outlook clouded by trade, central bank says, lowering global growth forecast", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-economy-interest-rates-1.5206389", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5206396.1562761904!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/boc-economy-20190709.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 10, 2019 8:34 AM ET", "2019-07-10T16:10:00.319Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Bank of Canada is leaving its key interest rate unchanged in an announcement that balances domestic economic improvements with an expanding global slowdown caused by trade conflicts.\nThe decision Wednesday kept the interest rate at 1.75 per cent for a sixth-straight meeting, as Canada rebounds from a weak stretch that nearly brought the economy to a halt in late 2018 and early 2019.\nPoloz and the governing council appeared to be in no rush to change the rate, even as they noted policy-makers in the U.S. and Europe have signalled they may introduce cuts to respond to weakened global economic activity.\n\"Recent data show the Canadian economy is returning to potential growth,\" the Bank of Canada said in a statement.\n\"However, the outlook is clouded by persistent trade tensions. Taken together, the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate.\"\nThe Bank of Canada, which was widely expected to stand pat Wednesday, said it will continue to monitor data ahead of future decisions with a particular focus on developments in the energy sector and the effects of global trade tensions.\nFallout from the uncertain international trade environment was also reflected in the bank's updated economic projections, which were also released Wednesday in the bank's quarterly monetary policy report.\nThe bank downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast to three per cent from 3.2 per cent due to trade disputes \u2014 the U.S.-China fight, in particular \u2014 that have rippled through the world's economy.\n\"Escalating trade conflicts, geopolitical tensions and related uncertainty are contributing to the broad-based slowdown of global economic activity,\" the bank said in its report.\nThe wider trade-related fights and, in some cases, direct actions are having an impact on Canada.\nChina's recent trade actions on meat and canola products from Canada are expected to lower exports by 0.2 per cent, the bank said. The changes, including stricter inspections on Canadian goods by Chinese authorities, have come amid a bilateral diplomatic dispute.\nThe bank predicted economic growth in Canada this year of 1.3 per cent, up slightly from its April forecast of 1.2 per cent, and an expansion of 1.9 per cent in 2020, down from its previous call of 2.1 per cent.\nThe Bank of Canada raised its forecast for second-quarter growth to annual pace of 2.3 per cent, up from its April projection of 1.3 per cent, following the stronger-than-expected rebound from the slowdown at the start of the year. It predicted growth an annual pace of 1.5 per cent for the third quarter.\nThe unexpectedly robust bounce back, the bank said, was due to temporary factors such as a recovery from weather-related weaknesses and a boost in oil production.\nConsumption in Canada is being supported by the healthy job market and rising wages, while the housing market at a country-wide level is stabilizing, the bank said. In addition, climate-related incentive payments from the federal government, which are front-loaded, could also provide a temporary boost to household spending.\nThe Canadian economy ran at close to full tilt for most of 2017 and 2018 \u2014 a stretch that saw Poloz hike the interest rate five times. A sharp drop in oil prices in late 2018 prompted the bank to hit pause and it hasn't raised the rate since last October.\nCandice Bangsund, vice-president and portfolio manager\u00a0of global asset allocation for\u00a0Fiera Capital, said the Bank of Canada's decision not to cut rates is \"largely justified given the latest economic developments in Canada.\"\n\"Oil production has recommenced, exports have spiked, business confidence has improved, and domestic conditions remain stable thanks to supportive labour market trends (record-low unemployment,\u00a0surging wages),\" Bangsund said in a written statement.\nBrian DePratto, senior economist for TD Economics, said the monetary report and interest rate decision support TD's view that the Bank of Canada \"will stand pat\" on rates as the domestic economy settles into a steady pattern of growth.\n\"They would likely need to see more of the downside risks materialize in hard data to alter that position, with trade tensions topping the list,\" he said in a written response to the update.\nJames Laird, co-founder of Ratehub Inc. and president of CanWise Financial mortgage brokerage, said the announcement is \"welcome news for Canadians considering a variable rate mortgage.\"\n\"In the absence of major economic changes, the bank seems intent to maintain this policy interest rate in the near future,\" he said in a written statement.\n"}, {"author": "Amanda Parris", "title": "Remembering Little Jamaica: This new film pays tribute to a disappearing Toronto neighbourhood", "description": "Amanda Parris talks to Sharine Taylor about documenting a history that means a lot to both of them", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/arts/remembering-little-jamaica-this-new-film-pays-tribute-to-a-disappearing-toronto-neighbourhood-1.5300174", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300180.1569604399!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sharine-taylor.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 27, 2019 2:26 PM ET", "2019-09-27T18:26:10.600Z"], "source": "CBC Arts", "content": "I remember the first time I experienced Eglinton Avenue West in Toronto. My mum and I were on the 32C bus and as it turned out of Eglinton West station, the sound of reggae music caught my attention. When I looked out the window, my eyes widened. Flags seemed to hang from every window, barrels piled in front of doorways, BBQ\u00a0grills spewed smoke into the air.\u00a0Voices with accents from Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada and St. Lucia could be heard and people \u2014Black people \u2014\u00a0lined the streets. My mum and I wondered aloud what was going on. Was it a festival? A street party? An old woman next\u00a0to us chuckled. Apparently what we were witnessing was just an average day in the neighbourhood I later learned was called Little Jamaica.\nThat memory of a vibrant, pulsating and dynamic community is what inspired writer and director Sharine Taylor to create her new documentary short Tallawah Abroad: Remembering Little Jamaica which premiered earlier this week at the Montreal Black Film Festival. Taylor moved out of the neighbourhood and into the suburbs as a child, so when she returned almost two decades later in 2017, she was stunned to see the transformation. Shuttered storefronts, clouds of dust and cranes reaching to the sky were now the features that characterized Eglinton West.\u00a0\n\"I was really taken aback by everything,\" she told me during a phone interview earlier this week. \"There's nobody there.\" Taylor is following the footsteps of other Toronto based artists like photographer Jon Black and writer Zalika Reid-Benta who are doing the urgent work of documenting the Caribbean-Canadian community before it disappears.\nLittle Jamaica's devolution into a virtual ghost town is a direct result of the ambitious, costly and several-times delayed transit project: the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit.\u00a0 Years of noisy construction, constant road closures and hijacked sidewalks have led to a plunge in revenue for the local businesses that once populated the area. Hair salons, barbershops, Caribbean grocery stores, clothing stores, music stories and restaurants have experienced plummeting revenues, forcing some to close their doors forever.\u00a0\u00a0\nTallawah Abroad follows Vernal Small, a tailor whose shop has been open on the corner of Oakwood Avenue and Eglinton West for over four decades. His frank and sorrowful tone when discussing the disruption that the construction has caused to his business is a quietly devastating reminder of the very real and human consequences that are a result of this construction. \"There were people that I spoke to who were just like, 'I've given up. I'm not even trying to fight anymore. They've taken so much from me,'\" Taylor said. \"That's a really hard thing to negotiate.\"\nIn the mid-twentieth century, when Black immigrants from the Caribbean began arriving in large numbers to the city, they settled in areas such as Bathurst and Bloor, the community around Jane and Finch\u00a0and of course\u00a0Eglinton West. At a time when wide-spread housing discrimination was the\u00a0norm, these geographic enclaves became spaces of refuge and belonging where communities, institutions and culture was built.\u00a0\n\"When my grandma first came to Toronto in the '70s, [Eglinton West] was a place that she frequented to get specific brands or food items that weren't as widely available as they are now.\" Taylor told me over the phone. \"My aunt used to drag me there every weekend when she was getting her hair and nails done. My mom used to go there to get certain groceries. For it to not have the same feel as it did in the past is really disheartening.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nMy mum and I moved to the area a few years after visiting, yearning for that sense of community we couldn't find in the suburbs. When I purchased my first home, I chose one\u00a0in the neighbourhood, still wanting to remain within walking distance of roti shops and stores where I could find raw shea butter. Growing up I recall the crowds that would flood the streets of Eglinton West for Kiddies Carnival. I remember standing in front of Randy's Patties with friends after school or meeting up with a crush at\u00a0Trea-Jah-Isle record shop.\u00a0 I wonder about the future of many of these businesses, especially those that don't own their buildings. The transit line brings with it an increase in property value and that can often lead to a spike in rental prices.\nA recent graduate paper\u00a0by Debbie Gordon on the transformation of Little Jamaica considers the stated goals of the transit project and argues that \"their primary focus is on developing infrastructure to maximize profit opportunities along the Eglinton Crosstown's route for commercial and real estate investors.\" There is a language that is used in many of these transit proposals. It's a language that may not utilize the term 'revitalization' but exploits its meaning constantly. Gordon challenges that language and the ethos of progress that it asserts (because of course in Toronto condos = progress) writing, \"Considering historical precedents around transit development, these developments most likely foreshadow Little Jamaica's displacement and erasure rather than its improvement.\"\nThere's a saying in Toronto that there are only two seasons in the city: winter and construction season. It's a wry observation of the ongoing construction and development happening everywhere. In a city dominated by condos and glass skyscrapers that seems to have little regard for history or cultural memory, it can be easy to categorize the destruction of Little Jamaica as yet another victim of this widespread rush to development.\u00a0 However Gordon argues that Eglinton West needs to be examined through another, more historical lens.\nAs the home to such a large and concentrated population of Black people who built communities, businesses and institutions in the area, its dismantling points to a more insidious pattern. She lists the destruction of Africville in Nova Scotia and Hogan's Alley in Vancouver, the renaming of Negro Creek Road to Moggie Road in Holland Township, Ontario and the ploughing over of the Black Durhan Road Cemetery in Southwestern Ontario as incidents that point to Canada's pattern of consistent erasing and displacing of Black communities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"One of the larger questions that I wanted to prompt in this is whose spaces get marked as spaces that are in need of preservation,\" Taylor says of her film. In 2014, the City of Toronto named the historic alleyway at Eglinton and Oakwood \"Reggae Lane\" and a 1,200 square foot mural by artist Adrian Hayles was created in recognition of its storied history as a hub for Jamaican migrants and reggae music in the 70s and 80s. However in Tallawah Abroad, Zalika Reid-Benta questions the intention behind naming this space, wondering if it was done to commemorate a community that would no longer be there. \"I wanted for people to think about gentrification without explicitly saying it,\" Taylor tells me. \"It's so obvious that this is what it is. It works in such secret and silent ways too. When areas get 'revitalized'\u00a0there's a whole other set of politics that come with it. All these things become available but it's definitely at the expense of pushing the original inhabitants of the space out.\"\nI rode the 32C bus for the first time in many years last month. This time the sounds of reggae music were replaced by jackhammering and rumbling drills. Entire buildings were knocked down, countless store fronts were covered up and although the streets weren't empty, they were a shell of the vibrant, colourful and dynamic neighbourhood that my mother and I fell in love with. I wondered about future generations who may not have a Little Jamaica and where they would find their spaces of physical and geographic Caribbean community. \u00a0\n\"I want people to know that we have a storied history and ties to that space,\" Taylor told me. \"I guess I'm asking folks to ponder a little bit more about what kinds of spaces go through this process and what's at stake when things like this happen.\"\nTallawah Abroad: Remembering Little Jamaica premiered earlier this week at the Montreal Black Film Festival. It will also screen at the Toronto Black Film Festival and the Halifax Black Film Festival in February 2020\n"}, {"author": "Kathleen Harris", "title": "Liberals promise to halve tax rate for clean tech companies as part of long-range climate action plan", "description": "Environmental proposals would push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, party says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-climate-change-action-plan-2050-1.5295027", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295657.1569365029!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/trudeau-in-burnaby.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2019 8:58 AM ET", "2019-09-24T20:28:07.327Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions \u2014 part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050,\u00a0Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced today.\nTaxes for small\u00a0clean technology businesses would be reduced to 4.5 per cent from the current nine per cent under the Liberal plan, while larger companies would pay 7.5 per cent in taxes instead of the current 15 per cent.\nEligible sectors could include manufacturing related to renewable energy, production of renewable fuels, zero emission vehicles and batteries for them, carbon capture and removal technology\u00a0and electric vehicle charging systems.\nIt's part of the Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, joining the European Union and countries making the\u00a0same climate pledge at the United Nations\u00a0in New York City this week.\n\"It's an ambitious target, but it's doable,\" said Trudeau at a campaign event in Burnaby, B.C., the home riding of NDP Leader\u00a0Jagmeet Singh.\nThe Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan\u00a0would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians. To date, there have been few details on how those targets will be met, but Trudeau said other announcements will roll out through the week.\nNet-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.\nThe Liberal plan also promises\u00a0to exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goal.\nTrudeau is also announcing a Liberal government would ensure all federal buildings run on clean electricity by 2022, and that the government would strengthen green procurement policies and leverage bulk\u00a0purchasing power to drive clean technology.\nAccording to the Liberal Party, the clean tech tax measure would cost about $15 million in 2020-21 and rise\u00a0to about $67 million by 2023-24. The other measures Trudeau announced would be paid for\u00a0by current departmental resources, the party said.\nThe Liberal Party said costing details would be released over the course of the campaign. The party has not released a costing analysis carried out by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservatives and NDP\u00a0have been doing with their announcements.\nTrudeau said climate change is the great global challenge of the age and tried to frame the choice Canadian voters have to make in the upcoming election as one between ambition and complacency.\n\"Do you want to be represented by a team that has a serious, ambitious plan that is committed to do more, or do you want a team of climate deniers with no long-term vision for Canada's environmental and economic future?\" he said.\nEarlier today, Ottawa Centre Liberal candidate Catherine McKenna, who has been serving as federal environment minister, said Canadians have a stark choice to make on climate policy in this election.\n\"Conservative politicians want to stop this progress. They want to follow (Ontario Premier) Doug Ford's example, where it's free to pollute, where we cancel programs that are helping businesses, schools, hospitals, people save money and do right by the environment,\" she said during a campaign event at a local Ottawa company that transitions homes and businesses to solar power.\n\"That is exactly what [Conservative Leader] Andrew Scheer would do, too.\"\nPressed by reporters on how the Liberals would achieve the ambitious targets, McKenna was light on specifics. She would not say if pursuing a net-zero target would require an increase in the carbon tax, or what penalties could\u00a0be imposed for not meeting legislated emissions targets.\nMcKenna said the path forward would\u00a0be charted by an expert panel, adding climate change represents both a moral responsibility and an economic opportunity for Canada.\n\"We may not know exactly how to get there, but that's the same of all the countries that have committed to this and the businesses,\" she said.\n\"But we will figure this out, and the way we will do this is by having a serious climate plan with credible and pragmatic action, by listening to the experts and, most of all, listening to young people in the streets who are saying, 'Are you going to act for our future?'\"\nMillions of young people have\u00a0taken to the streets in about 150 countries around the world demanding that world leaders adopt urgent measures to avert an environmental catastrophe.\nThe worldwide action was inspired by 16-year-old\u00a0Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who castigated national\u00a0leaders at the United Nations on Monday for their failure to combat climate change.\nThe climate change plan would include bringing in something called a \"Just Transition Act\" to give workers in affected sectors access to training, support and new opportunities to adapt to the transforming economy.\nIn August, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May offered a similar proposal to transition oil and gas sector workers to green energy jobs.\nKey to the Liberal climate change action plan is the carbon tax, which\u00a0set a minimum carbon price of $20 per tonne this year, increasing $10 a year to $50 by 2022. The federal government imposed the tax on businesses and individuals in provinces with no federally approved carbon pricing\u00a0plan. In those provinces, the government is handing back carbon tax rebates to most residents. Several provinces have challenged the tax in court challenges without success.\nThe Conservatives are campaigning against the carbon tax, calling it a \"Liberal tax grab\" that hikes costs for consumers.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his first act in government would be to scrap the tax.\nAsked to respond to the Liberal announcement today, Scheer said Trudeau is a \"master at improv\" and accused the Liberals of making up policy on the fly without providing details on how it would work. He said that, under the Liberals, Canada would fall behind in the climate change fight because of the carbon tax that he says is driving up the cost of living for Canadians.\n\"We are committed to the targets that we signed on to. That is our plan and our plan gives the best chance to Canada of succeeding,\" he said during a campaign stop in Thorold, Ont.\nThe NDP has said it would keep carbon pricing in place, double funding for disaster mitigation caused by climate change and create 300,000 new green jobs in infrastructure, transit, housing and renewable energy as part of its environmental plan.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Trudeau of offering \"nice words\" and \"pretty promises\" that are not backed up by action.\n\"No one believes that Mr. Trudeau is going to actually follow through on those commitments,\" he said during a campaign stop in Winnipeg. \"We believe that we have to take action and now we are committed to moving away from fossil fuels. We know the future for our country and for the world is a future where we are not burning carbon for fuel.\"\n"}, {"author": "Jamie Malbeuf", "title": "Soaring condo insurance rates help push Fort McMurray homeowner into bankruptcy", "description": "'There's not anything we can do anymore,' Kaleena Carriere says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-bankruptcy-condo-insurance-1.5393448", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5393453.1576115316!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/kaleena-carriere.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 15, 2019 6:00 AM MT", "2019-12-16T03:27:34.127Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A woman says she walked away from her Fort McMurray condo after skyrocketing insurance costs became \"the final straw\" in her battle to keep the home.\nKaleena Carriere, 31, bought her townhouse-style condo in April 2014.

The coverage must be for replacement cost value. Owners pay the insurance costs through their condo fees.\u00a0\nThe Cedarwoods condo board was offered $10 million of coverage, even though the appraised value of the 156-townhome complex was $65 million. That's despite the insurance premium of $925,000.\nIn 2018, the board had been able to get\u00a0insurance coverage for the full property appraisal at a cost of $142,000.\nDan Edwards, vice-chair of the Cedarwoods condo board, said the board got only one insurance offer and had to take it, in an effort to comply with the Alberta Condominium Property Act.\n\"You have to accept it whether you like it or not,\" said Edwards, who owns a condo in the complex. \"I can't make an insurance company offer me insurance.\n\"No one wanted to pay this.\"\nEdwards said if there's a disaster that destroys everyone's property, the board doesn't have enough coverage to rebuild and everyone \"will likely be out on the street.\"\n\"We don't understand what's going on. We're all hurt by this,\" he said.\nHe's not sure what the legal ramifications of not having enough coverage are because this is \"uncharted territory,\" he said.\nEdwards said the board is still working with a lawyer and trying to come up with a solution to get full coverage at a reasonable price.\nEdmonton lawyer Robert Noce said owners of Cedarwoods condos should be worried.\nThe condo board's decision to accept insurance coverage that only accounts for one sixth of the appraised value is so uncommon that he's never heard of it happening before, Noce said.\n\"It's impossible to think that an insurer would only insure a portion of that, knowing full well that the value of the property is significantly higher,\" Noce said. \"I can't think of any board, individual board members, that would be so negligent and expose themselves to personal liability by making such a decision.\"\nOwners and the condo board should immediately seek legal advice, he said.\n\"I would truly hope that that particular condominium corporation has sought legal advice to protect them from what will inevitably be exposure at a personal level of the board members if they can't get this issue resolved.\"\nIn October, Wood Buffalo councillors voted to lobby the provincial and federal governments in an attempt to ensure that condo boards are able to secure complete, affordable insurance coverage.\nAdam Hardiman, spokesperson for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, confirmed the municipality sent letters to members of Parliament, local MLAs and the prime minister's office, among others.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mayor Don Scott said the lack of affordable condo insurance options is quickly becoming a crisis\u00a0that will affect other parts of Canada, \"particularly those that have experienced flooding or wildfire.\"\nRob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an email that IBC is still talking to insurance companies and government about solutions for condo insurance.\n\"We understand the seriousness of this issue and we are doing everything we can to address individual circumstances,\" de Pruis said.\nThe government says it's still working with insurance providers about the issue, and Finance Minister Travis Toews has \"asked industry to work to find solutions for condominium owners in the region,\" Service Alberta representative Tricia Velthuizen said in an emailed statement.\nCarriere said it's unlikely she'll be able to buy a house again for years. She received an outpouring of support after posting about her bankruptcy on Facebook.

In a Facebook post, Carriere said she stopped making payments on her home and \"accepted that the bank was going to take it from me.\"\n\"I didn't believe it,\" Carriere told CBC. \"I cried when I came to the realization that this was happening.\"\nCarriere said she considered selling the condo, but figures she would have ended up deep in debt.\nShe had paid $350,000 for the home but believes it is now worth less than $200,000 because of declining property values in Fort McMurray.\nIn a statement of claim, her bank alleges she still owed $278,000 on her mortgage when she stopped making payments.\nIn Alberta, condominium boards must carry insurance on all units and common property against loss resulting from destruction or damage caused by fire, lightning, windstorms, hail, explosions, water damage and other perils. The coverage must be for replacement cost value. Owners pay the insurance costs through their condo fees.\u00a0\nThe Cedarwoods condo board was offered $10 million of coverage, even though the appraised value of the 156-townhome complex was $65 million. That's despite the insurance premium of $925,000.\nIn 2018, the board had been able to get\u00a0insurance coverage for the full property appraisal at a cost of $142,000.\nDan Edwards, vice-chair of the Cedarwoods condo board, said the board got only one insurance offer and had to take it, in an effort to comply with the Alberta Condominium Property Act.\n\"You have to accept it whether you like it or not,\" said Edwards, who owns a condo in the complex. \"I can't make an insurance company offer me insurance.\n\"No one wanted to pay this.\"\nEdwards said if there's a disaster that destroys everyone's property, the board doesn't have enough coverage to rebuild and everyone \"will likely be out on the street.\"\n\"We don't understand what's going on. We're all hurt by this,\" he said.\nHe's not sure what the legal ramifications of not having enough coverage are because this is \"uncharted territory,\" he said.\nEdwards said the board is still working with a lawyer and trying to come up with a solution to get full coverage at a reasonable price.\nEdmonton lawyer Robert Noce said owners of Cedarwoods condos should be worried.\nThe condo board's decision to accept insurance coverage that only accounts for one sixth of the appraised value is so uncommon that he's never heard of it happening before, Noce said.\n\"It's impossible to think that an insurer would only insure a portion of that, knowing full well that the value of the property is significantly higher,\" Noce said. \"I can't think of any board, individual board members, that would be so negligent and expose themselves to personal liability by making such a decision.\"\nOwners and the condo board should immediately seek legal advice, he said.\n\"I would truly hope that that particular condominium corporation has sought legal advice to protect them from what will inevitably be exposure at a personal level of the board members if they can't get this issue resolved.\"\nIn October, Wood Buffalo councillors voted to lobby the provincial and federal governments in an attempt to ensure that condo boards are able to secure complete, affordable insurance coverage.\nAdam Hardiman, spokesperson for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, confirmed the municipality sent letters to members of Parliament, local MLAs and the prime minister's office, among others.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mayor Don Scott said the lack of affordable condo insurance options is quickly becoming a crisis\u00a0that will affect other parts of Canada, \"particularly those that have experienced flooding or wildfire.\"\nRob de Pruis, director of consumer and industry relations with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said in an email that IBC is still talking to insurance companies and government about solutions for condo insurance.\n\"We understand the seriousness of this issue and we are doing everything we can to address individual circumstances,\" de Pruis said.\nThe government says it's still working with insurance providers about the issue, and Finance Minister Travis Toews has \"asked industry to work to find solutions for condominium owners in the region,\" Service Alberta representative Tricia Velthuizen said in an emailed statement.\nCarriere said it's unlikely she'll be able to buy a house again for years. She received an outpouring of support after posting about her bankruptcy on Facebook. She said dozens of people told her they were going through the same thing.\n\"There needs to be some sort of cap on insurance for housing,\" Carriere said. \"There needs to be some regulation or something from the government that stops this from happening, because it's not just me.\n\"There's tons of my friends \u2026 tons of my neighbours.

Because the producer I always pledge to do it with doesn't drink.\nWHAT DOES ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE ELECTION?\nLike the fabled draugust, the political news week has been a bit dry.\nThe campaign is not officially on yet, but party leaders are travelling the country, with war rooms plotting schedules for what will be a very busy few months.\nWhere they go, and why, will say a lot about what each party sees as the strengths and weaknesses that lie ahead.\nOne issue that did get a lot of attention this week, is the resignation of Canada's ambassador in Washington.\nAfter three years in what is arguably considered Canada's most important diplomatic posting, David MacNaughton is calling it quits to return to the private sector.\nMacNaughton's resignation serves as a reminder that NAFTA/CUSMA/USMCA is still very much a live issue for senior government officials, and will come up during the election here.\nAmerican lawmakers have not yet ratified the deal. Democrats want changes to the pact, and don't want to give Donald Trump a legislative win.\nThe Liberals will campaign on the fact they were able to keep the deal alive, despite Donald Trump repeatedly threatening to kill the agreement.\nIf they are able to win re-election, expect the Liberals to continue quietly lobbying U.S. lawmakers to ratify the deal, so it can finally be put to bed.\u00a0\nThough the Conservatives have criticized NAFTA 2.0, arguing that the new agreement is not as good for Canada as the original pact, the plan for Andrew Scheer and his team is to support the agreement as is.\nThe NDP is the outlier on this issue.\u00a0\n\"The new NAFTA is simply not good enough for Canadians in its current form,\" wrote NDP trade critic Tracey Ramsey in a statement this past spring.\n\"The NDP believes we should wait and give the U.S. Congress the time they need to improve the deal. Working people should not pay the price for bad negotiations.\" she said.\nDemocrats in the U.S. are demanding changes, specifically to the length of patent protections, as a way to lower drug prices. It is something Canada agrees with, though the Trudeau government's official position is that it does not support re-opening the deal, since it could mean other aspects of the agreement are tinkered with.\nThis echoes a debate that emerged in the 2015 campaign \u2014 when then-prime minister Stephen Harper announced Canada would be a part of the new Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade pact between pacific rim countries.\nShortly after the announcement, then NDP leader Tom Mulcair set off on an anti-TPP whistle-stop tour, visiting a half- dozen cities in southern Ontario.\u00a0\nWhile trade did not dominate the last campaign, expect it to pop up this go around.\u00a0\nNow, if you read all this on an August day, you deserve a drink.

After all, over the last three elections three different parties have won the most seats in the province.\nBut it's Newfoundland and Labrador that has suffered the most serious cases of whiplash over the last 15 years.\nSince 2004, no province has had a bigger average shift in support per party between elections than Newfoundland and Labrador.\nMajor parties have seen their share of the popular vote fluctuate by an average of 12 percentage points between one election and the next in the province.\nIn 2008, Premier Danny Williams' 'Anything but Conservative' campaign contributed to a 26-point decline in support for that party compared to the 2006 election. The NDP picked up most of that slack, surging 20 points.\nThere was another big move in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2015, when the Liberals jumped 27 points from their 2011 performance. The NDP dropped 12 points and the Conservatives fell 18 points as a result.\nDouble-digit wobbles for the Conservatives in 2006 and 2011 helped cement Newfoundland and Labrador as the province that has gone back and forth the most over the last few elections. But despite all that movement, there hasn't been a significant number of seats changing hands.\nThat's perhaps where Quebec has earned its reputation. The average fluctuation for each party between elections has been about 10 points since 2004, with enormous implications for party standings in the House of Commons.\nThe next two swing-iest on the list are New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\nThe province with the least swing? You could probably guess that one \u2014 it's Alberta, where parties have averaged a shift of less than five points between elections.\nAt this stage, at least, it looks like these provinces are going to hold true to form. The polls suggest big changes are in store in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, while the political map in Alberta might only see a few minor adjustments come October.\nPerhaps some things never change \u2014 including where things change the most.\nTap here to go to the\u00a0Canada Votes Poll Tracker\nOwenquann on Instagram asks: Will there be online voting? \nThe short answer is no. There won't be online voting in this election.\u00a0\nRemember that committee of MPs studying whether to change Canada's voting system? Along with recommending a referendum on proportional representation (a recommendation the government ignored), they also studied the possibility of online voting.\u00a0\nTheir conclusion: Don't do it.\u00a0\u00a0\nTheir report pointed to security concerns about online voting and unequal access to reliable internet across the country as just some of the reasons not to move to online voting.\u00a0\nAlthough the federal election won't have online voting, other jurisdictions are moving in that direction.\u00a0\nPeople in the Northwest Territories will elect 19 members to the N.W.T. Legislative Assembly in October \u2014 and it will be the first provincial or territorial election to use online voting in a general election. Voters can use a new website to vote online, as long as they've registered for an absentee ballot beforehand.\nSecurity experts have sounded the alarm about that election, but the company behind the voting site says it is safe for an election the size of N.W.T.'s.\u00a0\nIf things go smoothly in that election, maybe the federal government might take another look at online voting, but for now you'll have to vote the old fashioned way.\u00a0\nOf course, information on how to do that is available online.\u00a0\n\u2014 Tyler Buist, Producer\nHave a question about the October election?

The group presented the petition, which has about 50,000 signatures, to Hussen's staff.\n\"The problem is we are paying three times the tuition fees [compared to domestic students]\u00a0and we have a just\u00a0 20-hour limitation for working ... We're actually forced to work more to pay for the expenses and the fees,\" he said.\n\"I had to.\"\nAt issue are the rules around just how many hours study-permit holders are allowed to work off-campus.\nThe main purpose of the permit must be to study, the federal government says. A 20-hour per week limit \"reflects that, while continuing to offer the opportunity to gain valuable workplace experience in Canada and earn some money,\" reads a statement from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada sent to CBC News.\nInternational students are permitted to work full-time only outside of the academic year or during winter, spring and summer breaks.\n\"I came to Canada with a dream, to study, to settle here, to build a life for me and my family, Sandhu said. \"I am being punished for working too hard, and I'm calling on Canada to grant me a temporary resident permit, and ensure fairness and justice for other students like me.\"\nAmong those supporting Sandhu's last-ditch effort to fend off deportation is the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, which calls the 20-hour limit \"irrational.\"\n\"It makes no sense to arbitrarily pick a random number and limit people like Jobandeep's ability to work to just those hours,\" said the group's coordinator Syed Hussan, who wants to see all migrants including international students receive permanent residence status at the time of their arrival in Canada.\n\"Everyone including migrant students should have the same rights, and that means full labour rights, the same fees, and permanent resident status from day one;\u00a0that's just fair,\" said Varunpreet Singh, an organizer with the group.\nAccording to the group's research, Canada issued 357,230 new study permits in 2018, but beyond that\u00a0they say it's difficult to know how many international students are in the country at any one time. That's because the government doesn't necessarily track whether students have left after their permits expire.\nFederal estimates for 2016 put that number at $15.5 billion, up from $12.8 billion in 2015. Ontario received the lion's share of that spending, with international students contributing $7.8 billion to its economy in 2016, followed by $3.7 billion in British Columbia.\u00a0\n\"We can't have a multi-tiered economy, or different laws for different people, we need a single system and that means permanent resident status on arrival for all migrants, including students,\" Hussan said.\nIn its statement to CBC News, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said anyone hoping to work full-time and study part-time in Canada should seek a work permit before applying for a study permit.\nHussan says\u00a0a work permit would first require that an employer apply for what's called a labour-market impact assessment, which can take up to six months to approve. Only then can the individual apply for the work permit from abroad, which may or may not be approved.\u00a0\nSandhu says he was working as a truck driver\u00a035 hours per week in addition to being in school full-time when he was arrested.\nIn the end, Sandhu was fortunate to have received his diploma before any deportation orders took effect and has applied for a temporary resident permit, which is\u00a0only issued in exceptional circumstances and only at the discretion of a processing officer, according to the federal government's website.\u00a0\nNeither the immigration minister nor a representative from the IRCC were present at Friday's rally, but the group is hopeful the immigration minister\u00a0will step in and stop the deportation.\n\"I didn't hurt anybody, I didn't kill anybody, I didn't rob,\" said Sandhu.\nWorking, he said, shouldn't be a crime.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: What's happening in Canada and around the world on April 17", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces $1.7B to clean up orphan wells", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid19-april17-canada-world-1.5535549", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 17, 2020 8:29 AM ET", "2020-04-18T03:28:14.378Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nMore than 100\u00a0Canadian Forces members with medical training will be sent to Quebec after the province asked for help at its long-term care homes struggling with growing COVID-19 outbreaks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.\nTrudeau\u00a0\u2014 who also announced several new funding initiatives Friday, including a plan to help the energy sector\u2014 said\u00a0that the federal government will keep working with Quebec to find ways to support the province, including\u00a0working with the Red Cross and specialized volunteers who have signed up with Health Canada.\nPM: 125 members of the Canadian forces will be going to Quebec to support their long term care centres.\nHealth officials in Canada said Thursday that more than 90 per cent of COVID-19-related deaths have been people over 60\u00a0\u2014 but\u00a0they also highlighted the needs of another vulnerable group, saying the homeless and people with unstable housing situations are at increased risk.\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's top public health official, said\u00a0that shelters that serve the homeless need the resources and support to do proper infection control\u00a0\u2014 and to protect staff and clients.

Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, nonessential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen.\nSensitive about persistent questions about the capacity for testing, U.S. President Donald Trump had his health team lead a briefing Friday, saying adequate capacity exists to get states through the first phase of the guidelines for how they should reopen.\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly and claimed earlier this week that he had total authority over the matter, even though the lockdowns and other physical-distancing measures have been imposed by state and local leaders, not Washington.\n\"We may be opening but we're putting safety first,\" Trump said.\nOn Thursday, he outlined a three-step set of guidelines for easing restrictions over a span of several weeks in places that have robust testing and are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, assuring the governors: \"You're going to call your own shots.\"\nBut governors of both parties suggested Friday that they would be cautious in returning to normal, with some warning that they can't do it without help from Washington to expand testing.\n\"The federal government cannot wipe its hands of this and say, 'Oh, the states are responsible for testing,\"' said New York Gov.\u00a0Cuomo, a Democrat. \"We cannot do it without federal help.\"\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican ally of Trump's, said he would listen to medical experts in deciding how to move forward.\n\"I am not going to do something that I feel in my heart is the wrong thing that's going to endanger our people,\" he said.\nEven in largely rural states with small populations, such as Wyoming, Maine and South Dakota, governors said they were not anxious to quickly resume business as usual.\n\"Until we've got the testing up to speed \u2014 which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping \u2014 we're just not going to be there,\" said Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican.\nThe official death toll in the U.S. neared 35,000, with about 685,000 confirmed infections.\nThe shutdowns have inflicted heavy damage on economies around the world. In the U.S., the crisis has cost at least 22 million\u00a0Americans their jobs, pushing the unemployment rate toward levels not seen since the Great Depression.\nMany Americans, especially in rural areas and other parts of the country that have not seen major outbreaks, have urged governors to reopen their economies. Protesters have taken to the streets in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and Michigan, where more than 3,000 turned out on Wednesday in what looked like one of the president's rallies, with Make America Great Again hats and Trump flags.\nProtests continued Friday, including one outside the home of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and another in Idaho, where the governor is a Republican.\nPublic health experts have warned that easing the shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back with a vengeance.\nThe official death toll in hard-hit New York City soared by more than half earlier this week when health authorities began including people who probably had COVID-19 but died without being tested. Nearly 3,800 deaths were added to the city's count.\nFrom The Associated Press and Reuters, updated at 7:30 p.m. ET\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is prodding federal officials and regional governors to \"act faster and more energetically\" to secure ventilators, protective gear and other essential supplies. He warned Russia is yet to see a peak of infections, adding Moscow was the first to face soaring numbers of infections and \"the problem is spreading into the regions.\"\nRussia has registered 32,008 coronavirus cases and 273 deaths.\u00a0Defence Ministry Sergei Shoigu reported the military is building 16 specialized hospitals for coronavirus patients, half of which will be completed this month.\nTokyo had 201 new cases of the coronavirus Friday, setting a new record for a\u00a0daily rise, bringing the\u00a0prefectural total to 2,796, with 56 deaths, according to Gov. Yuriko Koike. The Japanese capital has seen its new cases shoot up since late March, raising concerns about the infections becoming explosive.\nFriday's increase\u00a0in\u00a0cases comes 10 days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other urban prefectures, a measure he expanded to all of Japan on Thursday.\nThe city of Wuhan in China, where the novel coronavirus\u00a0that has since spread around the world was first reported, said it had revised up its total death toll by 50 per cent, addressing incorrect reporting, delays and omissions of cases. That would take China's total deaths to over 4,500.\nThe revision comes as U.S. and other officials question the accuracy of China's tallies \u2014\u00a0but also as those countries hit hardest by the pandemic have widely varying methodologies for counting their dead. The World Health Organization in Geneva has so far not commented on the Chinese revision.\nGermany's official statistical office said Friday that some 2.6 million students will soon return to schools as the country relaxes its pandemic lockdown rules. Authorities in Germany's 16 states agreed this week to allow a staggered reopening of schools, with students in their final two years of high school and the final year of primary returning first.\nGermany, a country of 83 million people, has so far recorded almost 137,700 confirmed infections of the novel\u00a0coronavirus, according to the\u00a0tally by Johns Hopkins University. Compared to other countries, Germany has had relatively few deaths \u2014 4,052 so far \u2014 less than a third the number seen in Britain, which has fewer confirmed cases.\nSome 940 of the 2,300-strong crew aboard France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier group have tested positive for COVID-19, the French Senate said in a statement on Friday, citing the military's chief medical officer.\nSpain's official gazette published Friday a government order for the country's 17 autonomous regions to unify the criteria on counting the dead in the coronavirus pandemic. The government said\u00a0that it's following WHO guidance and insists on counting only those who die having tested positive for the virus, whether they show symptoms or not\u00a0and no matter where the death takes place.\nThat figure on Thursday rose above the 19,000 mark, with a total of more than 182,000 infections. But the accounting system leaves out the patients who died with symptoms but were not tested.\nThe United Kingdom's hospital death toll from COVID-19 rose 847 to 14,576, as of Thursday afternoon local time, the Health Ministry said.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan says wearing face coverings, such as bandanas and scarves, could provide people with another layer of protection against the coronavirus and is lobbying the British government to change its advice.\nKhan told BBC radio that the evidence he has seen is that wearing a non-medical facial covering \"reduces the chances\" of those who have the virus giving it to somebody else. However, he did concede that it \"doesn't necessarily limit your chances of catching the virus.\"\nHe said changing the advice would be helpful for those in public transport or in shops, where some people may find it difficult to abide by the physical\u00a0distancing guidelines of staying two metres apart. Khan said it's important that there's a \"consistent approach\" across the country and that's why he's lobbying the government and its advisers.\nThe government's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, said Thursday that the evidence around masks being helpful in preventing the spread of the coronavirus is \"weak,\" while conceding it was a \"live issue.\"\nCoronavirus outbreaks across the Middle East threaten to shatter the lives of millions of already destitute people in conflict zones, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.\u00a0Hard-hit Iran, which has like several other countries\u00a0faced questions about how cases are identified and disclosed,\u00a0reported a new case total of almost 80,000 on Friday, with 4,958 deaths.\nThe African continent, which has some 400 million people living in poverty, also had weak health systems that were grossly inadequate to test for the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus and manage those infected, she said.\nNigeria's finance minister said a debt relief agreement reached this week to help the world's poorest countries deal with the coronavirus pandemic was a welcome first step but that middle-income countries with debt challenges also needed urgent help.\nIn remarks to be delivered at Friday's meeting of the World Bank's Development Committee, Zainab Ahmed said most countries in sub-Saharan Africa\u00a0were particularly vulnerable to the pandemic because high rates of self-employment meant physical distancing could not be sustained for long.\nRwanda is\u00a0using drones to keep residents of the capital Kigali informed of coronavirus lockdown measures \u2014\u00a0and to help catch those who abuse them. As police stop cars and pedestrians on streets to ask why they are out, two drones buzz above the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one loudly broadcasting instructions and the other monitoring movements. \"Drones are flying in areas where checkpoints are not mounted and where patrols could not be there,\" a police spokesperson said.\u00a0Among the culprits who have been caught is a pastor who pretended to be on her way to give a radio interview when, in fact, she was heading to church despite A ban on public gatherings.\nMexico's president said the country was looking to return to normal beginning June 1, with schools and businesses reopening provided people comply with anti-coronavirus health measures until then.\u00a0The Mexican government will inject around $2.5 billion US into the economy in May, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, as the country gears up to weather economic shocks from the coronavirus.\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday called for the reopening of his\u00a0country's borders, as he pushes to restart South America's largest economy.\u00a0But he conceded he may be blamed if the new coronavirus outbreak worsens as a result.\n\"Opening trade is a risk that I take, because if [the outbreak]\u00a0gets worse, it will fall on my lap,\" Bolsonaro said at the inauguration event for his new health minister, Nelson Teich.\u00a0Bolsonaro fired his health minister on Thursday after clashing with him over lockdown measures, which the president argues are overly damaging to the economy and should be rolled back.\nBrazil has 33,682 confirmed cases, with some 200 fatalities per day in the last four consecutive days, bringing the death toll to 2,141 as of Friday, according to Health Ministry data.\nWATCH |\u00a0Brazilian city tries novel way to force people to self-isolate during COVID-19:\nBangladesh has reported 15 more deaths and 266 cases of new infections from coronavirus over the last 24 hours, the country's health minister said Friday.

At times, the Trudeau government attempts to anoint itself as the great defender of that order \u2014 not a bad thing on its own, since multilateral institutions are supposed to keep any one country from acting unilaterally in a way that harms the rest of us.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is one of those multilateral institutions. It's a military and political alliance, formed after the Second World War, between Europe and North America. At NATO's heart is the concept of collective defence, enshrined in Article 5 of the treaty that created it. It means that an attack against one NATO member is regarded as an attack against all of them.\nNATO has taken some heat over the past few years from Trump. The president has suggested the U.S. could withdraw from the alliance, questioned the utility of Article 5 and called member states \"delinquent\" in their defence spending.\nHe's not entirely alone on that last point; former presidents like Barack Obama also have come down on allies like Canada for not spending enough on defence, arguing the U.S. has to do too much of the heavy lifting.\nCanada appeared at first to be responding to Trump's goading on defence spending. The Trudeau government released its defence policy in 2017, promising a 70 per cent increase in defence spending over a number of years.\nBut that timeline is important. A lot of that spending is contingent on whether projects go ahead as planned. The nightmare that is military procurement in this country (ships, jets - you know what I mean) doesn't exactly bode well for any timetable.\nCanada's spending on defence this year amounts to 1.23 per cent of this country's GDP. There was a loose agreement among NATO members to shoot for the 2 per cent mark.\nWe aren't the only ones missing that mark, of course. According to NATO's latest analysis, only seven of the 29 member countries hit that target. They include the U.S., the U.K. and Greece.\nThis stuff matters as far as the 'rules-based international order' goes - but will it matter in the next federal election? Traditionally, defence issues aren't a big factor for Canadian voters.\nI remember asking an expert about that in the midst of one of our fighter jet procurement controversies: billions of taxpayer dollars on the table, millions misspent - why wasn't it bothering people more? He told me Canadians like to see themselves as peaceful people (or at least they like the image), while the sums involved are too big, too abstract to really matter at the polls.\nWhat might lift the defence file to the level of an actual election issue in 2019 is the government's handling of the military itself. I'm thinking particularly of Mark Norman, the former second in command of the military, and everything that's happened in his case over the past few months.\nNorman was accused of leaking cabinet secrets, investigated, charged and suspended from his job. Ultimately, the charge against him was dropped. Along the way, his legal team accused the Prime Minister's Office of withholding evidence and meddling in the case. Norman's case had ended but it wasn't clear if he'd get his old job back. Turns out Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top soldier, was going to reinstate Norman - and Norman's replacement wasn't happy with that.\nIn the end, Norman settled with the government (no details were released); he won't be going back to his old job. But the man who replaced him, Lt. Gen. Paul Wynnyk, was so put off by the whole experience he decided to leave his job early. Basically, it's all a huge mess.\nWill Canadians buy the Opposition's claim that this is a mess created by the Liberals, that the military is in disarray because of unnecessary politicking? I don't know, but disarray in the Canadian military certainly strikes closer to home than NATO and defence spending. Stability in the military's top ranks really matters to the men and women tasked with defending our country. It might also turn out to matter to voters in October.\u00a0\nVassy Kapelos is host of Power & Politics, weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on CBC News Network.\nThe Power & Politics Power Panellists on where the big parties will be focused this week\nAmanda Alvaro,\u00a0president and co-founder of Pomp & Circumstance\nLiberals and Justin Trudeau, at the 100-day countdown to Election Day, are launching the largest Day of Action so far of 2019. Hundreds of Liberal teams across Canada will be on the doorsteps connecting with Canadians about the clear choice in this election, between the Liberal plan to invest in the middle class and the Conservative plan to go backward with cuts to vital services.\nRachel Curran,\u00a0senior associate at Harper & Associates Consulting\nThe Conservatives will be focused next week on an emergency meeting of the Public Safety Committee, which Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer pushed for, to discuss the massive data breach at Desjardins Group. They will also be highlighting agricultural issues, including ongoing trade access problems between Canada and China, ahead of the mid-July FPT Agriculture Ministers' Conference in Quebec City.\nKathleen Monk,\u00a0principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group\nNew Democrats will be in Canada's manufacturing heartland this week. The manufacturing sector has been dealt some serious blows in 2019 and folks are frustrated that politicians keep pointing fingers at one another. Jagmeet Singh will campaign alongside NDP candidate Malcolm Allen in Welland, Ont. to announce a plan to return those good, family-supporting manufacturing jobs to Canada.\n\u00c9ric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.\u00a0\nThe gap between the Conservatives and Liberals is narrowing \u2014 and it's mostly because of Ontario.\nA couple of polls this past week gave the Liberals the national edge over the Conservatives. It's possible that the political environment has flipped from the Conservative lead that has prevailed for the past five months.\nBut some caution is called for here. Mainstreet Research and Nanos Research, the two pollsters that put the Liberals ahead last week, have tended to post better results for the Liberals than other polling firms.\nConfirmation of a Liberal lead would have to wait until more pollsters weigh in \u2014 particularly those that have been less bullish on the Liberals in the past.\nNevertheless, the Poll Tracker is moving and the margin between the two parties is now just 2.9 percentage points. In the June 10 update, that gap was 5.7 points.\nMost of the shift can be chalked up to Ontario. The Conservatives have slipped 2.7 points there since June\u00a010, while the Liberals have gained 3.1 points \u2014 a total swing of nearly six points that's responsible for most of the movement we've seen in the national numbers.\nThe Liberals now lead in Ontario with 36.7 per cent in the Poll Tracker, compared to 32.4 per cent for the Conservatives.\nThe dial also has moved in a similar direction in most other parts of the country, particularly in Alberta, the wider Prairies and in Atlantic Canada. But it's Ontario that has the biggest electoral implications.\nThat's why \u2014 despite the Conservatives still leading by just under three points nationwide \u2014 it's virtually a toss-up as to which party would win the most seats if an election were held today.\nThey don't call Ontario \"seat-rich\"\u00a0for nothing.\nTap here to go to the full poll tracker\u00a0\nWe want to know what YOU want to know\nIrene Beaupr\u00e9 asks: What are the Conservatives, NDP and Greens promising on Indigenous issues? Are they committed to following the recommendations of the TRC? Are the Liberals promising to continue with their commitments to First Nations?\nHistorically, federal political parties haven't done all that much to court Indigenous voters. The First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit demographics have seen some of the lowest voter turnout rates \u2014 no doubt owing to a legacy of mistrust between many of them and a federal government that didn't always have their best interests in mind (the Indian residential school experience and the Inuit tuberculous policy are two obvious cases in point).\nIndeed, status Indians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0First Nations peoples with 'status' under the Indian Act \u2014 weren't even allowed to vote until reforms were pushed through by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in 1960 to extend the franchise.\nIn the modern era of reconciliation, ushered in by the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) final report documenting the horrors of residential schools, there has been a shift in Indigenous voting patterns.\nIn the 2015 federal election, First Nations members living on reserve voted in record numbers, recording a massive 14 point jump in participation, from 47.4 per cent in 2011 to 60.2 per cent in 2015. While that's still much lower than the overall voter turnout rate of 69.1 per cent, a new generation of First Nations people was clearly motivated to vote. In 2015, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde reversed what he called a long-standing practice and cast a ballot in a federal election.\nTo that end, political parties, particularly those on the centre-left, have made more of an effort to champion Indigenous policy options to court a growing voter bloc. The 33 federal ridings with substantial Indigenous populations could be very important to the fates of all the major parties, especially with Liberals and Conservatives deadlocked in the most recent polls.\nLiberal Party\nThe current Liberal government has had a mixed record on Indigenous issues. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clearly made reconciliation a top priority, investing billions of dollars in new money in program spending (in the last federal budget alone, 25 per cent of all new spending was earmarked for Indigenous-related initiatives). His government has lifted 58 of 105 long-term drinking water advisories on-reserve, committed $333 million over five years to revitalize Indigenous languages, passed legislation to begin reforming a badly broken child welfare system, signed a host of self-government agreements and made a series of apologies for past wrongs against Indigenous people.\nIt's a good record by many measures \u2014 but it's undermined by Trudeau's conflict with former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the first Indigenous person to hold such an important cabinet position, and by the government's championing of some natural resources projects (hello, Trans Mountain!) against the will of coastal First Nations in B.C. And even with the new investments, Indigenous activists have argued that much more money is needed to end persistent inequities.\nLook for the Liberals to propose further, deeper reforms to the Canadian state during the election campaign, including measures to enact the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) inquiry's \"calls for justice\" to address systemic levels of violence.\nConservative Party\nThe Conservatives have not been as vocal on the Indigenous file \u2014 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said the word \"Indigenous\" only seven times in the House of Commons over the last four years \u2014 but former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose signalled a shift early in the last Parliament by dropping the party's longstanding opposition to an MMIWG inquiry.\u00a0\nThe party's Indigenous critic, B.C. MP Cathy McLeod, said that while the party doesn't agree with the inquiry's final \"genocide\" finding, a government led by Scheer would draw up its own proposal to implement those \"calls for justice.\"\nTrue to form, the Conservative Party also has said that it will champion oil and gas projects \u2014 and energy infrastructure initiatives like the Indigenous-led Eagle Spirit pipeline \u2014 to bring more wealth and prosperity to remote Indigenous communities that have few economic opportunities beyond the natural resources sector.\nIn 2015, the Conservative platform had three pages of specific Indigenous proposals \u2014 including a promise to establish a property ownership regime for those reserves that want it, and pitches to expand anti-gang programming and rural broadband services. Scheer could very well recommit to those promises and build on them.\nThe NDP\nThe New Democratic Party has been a champion of Indigenous issues in this Parliament, with the party's MPs frequently lambasting the prime minister and his ministers for perceived inaction. They successfully pushed the government to begin fully implementing 'Jordan's Principle' to ensure equal funding for Indigenous kids in health care and other social services, and to end discriminatory practices in the child welfare system.\nJagmeet Singh will likely look to continue the party's strong legacy on the First Nations file by promising to introduce government legislation to enact the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (as the Liberals also have promised to do) and kill pipeline projects they think lack sufficient Indigenous support. The most important aspect of the NDP's Indigenous policy platform is the idea of spending more to tackle the on-reserve housing 'crisis' that has left so many First Nations people without adequate shelter.\nThe Green Party\nElizabeth May's Green Party also has said it will act on Indigenous issues if elected but their proposals to this point have faced criticisms. Robert Jago, a prominent Montreal-based Indigenous writer, businessperson and member of the Nooksack Tribe and Kwantlen First Nation, called them \"thin, unrealistic and riddled with embarrassing errors\" in a piece for the B.C.-based online news outlet The Tyee. The party's \"Vision Green\" platform proposes a phase-out of the Indian Act, \"ideally in less than 10 years,\" and better accommodation of Indigenous interests with respect to natural resources projects.\n\u2014 John Paul Tasker, senior writer\nHave a question about the October election?

It is unacceptable.

Quebec, B.C. and Alberta are each testing at double Ontario's rate.\u00a0\u00a0\nData from the Ontario\u00a0Ministry of Health shows there were just 2,568 new test results provided on Tuesday. That's roughly half the daily target of 5,000 that the government promised to achieve in late March, and far short of the 19,000 tests per day promised for the third week of April.\u00a0\n\"It's possible that there are more people out there who have this infection that we're not aware of, and they may be spreading it on to their contacts,\" Dr. Jeff Kwong, a professor of public health and family medicine at the University of Toronto, told CBC News.\nThe reason for the shortfall appears to be that Ontario continues to restrict who gets tested by recommending against tests for people who have not recently travelled internationally, even if they have symptoms of COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWATCH | Premier Doug Ford addresses low rate of testing in Ontario:\nFord said he wants to see every front-line health-care worker and every long-term\u00a0care worker tested, along with first responders, police and paramedics.\n\"When you increase testing, you're going to be getting better results,\" Ford said.\u00a0\nPeople in several\u00a0Canadian provinces have learned in the past week\u00a0how the COVID-19 epidemic might unfold in their\u00a0region, as health experts and officials presented a range of projections and scenarios around how the virus will spread.\nSaskatchewan released its modelling Wednesday, which shows the provincial\u00a0government is planning for 3,000 to 8,300 deaths and approximately 20 to 200 daily intensive care admissions from COVID-19 at its peak. The data does not say when that peak is expected nor when distancing measures might be eased.\u00a0\nNewfoundland\u00a0and Labrador also released\u00a0projections\u00a0Wednesday, which focus\u00a0on how the province's intensive care units would deal with a surge in patients. They did not release projections related to numbers of cases or deaths.\u00a0The data found the\u00a0province will exceed its ICU capacity by the end of June if the spread of the virus continues at its current rate.\nIn Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney\u00a0outlined what he described as a \"probable\" scenario for the province\u00a0on Tuesday that suggested the province won't see a peak in the virus until mid-May. That model suggested Alberta could see as many as 800,000 COVID-19 cases by the end of the summer, with death figures ranging from 400 to 3,100. Another more \"elevated\" scenario pointed toward the possibility of both higher case numbers and between\u00a0500 and 6,600 deaths.\nKenney noted that the figures may seem overwhelming, and was quick to caution that the models are \"not a done deal.\"\u00a0\n\"How many people are infected, how many die, whether we overwhelm our health-care system \u2014\u00a0all of that depends on us and our choices.\"\u00a0\nWATCH | Quebec presents COVID-19 scenarios:\nQuebec also offered up modelling information earlier this week at the request of Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, who wanted to share the information publicly\u00a0despite concerns from his chief public health official.\nThe modelling out of Quebec suggested the province could see between 1,200 and 9,000 deaths by the end of April. Public health officials noted that the current thinking is that the number of deaths will be closer to the lower estimate.\nOntario, which saw its total number of reported cases pass 5,000 on Wednesday,\u00a0presented its modelling\u00a0last week.\nThe federal government has suggested it will do the same once it has sufficient information from the provinces\u00a0\u2014 though when that might be was not immediately clear.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau largely focused on emergency economic measures Wednesday as he gave his daily address outside Rideau Cottage, but he also faced questions about when Canada would release national-level forecasts.\nWhen is the federal modelling coming? Trudeau says the provinces have released more data this week - they're \"collating, looking at those and integrating them into a national model and we'll have more to say over the coming days.\"\nTrudeau said people would learn more about a national model in the coming days, but did not provide a specific date. The prime minister also said it's not yet clear\u00a0exactly when Canada will reach a\u00a0peak\u00a0but that strict adherence to critical public health measures \u2014 including physical distancing and staying home as much as possible \u2014 will help reduce the impact of the outbreak.\n\"Let's keep doing what we're doing,\" he said.\nIn British Columbia, case numbers haven't hit the levels\u00a0seen in Quebec and Ontario. Premier\u00a0John Horgan said officials in his province are \"optimistic\" but noted that \"we're far from out of the woods yet.\"\u00a0\nHorgan\u00a0told CBC's Rosemary Barton on Wednesday that in his view\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the view of B.C. chief health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry \u2014\u00a0the objective of modelling is to help the province plan and prepare.\u00a0\n\"We need to use that modelling for practical reasons,\" he said.\nHorgan\u00a0said\u00a0the \"curve is starting to bend\" in B.C. and he is encouraged by that, but expressed concern about people getting less vigilant about physical distancing and other measures as the weather improves.\u00a0\nDr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has previously noted that projections are used for planning purposes and are\u00a0not \"crystal balls.\" The models can vary widely, Tam has said, and\u00a0are \"highly sensitive to our actions,\" including measures like distancing, self-isolation and handwashing.\nTam reminded Canadians\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0not to visit extended family for upcoming religious holidays.  She said that \"planking the curve\" of transmission will be a challenge as the weather warms and holidays such as Easter, Vaisakhi, Ramadan and Passover approach.\u00a0But she said travelling to see family for these events is not considered essential.\nEmployment Minister Carla Qualtrough joined the briefing by health officials to announce how many Canadians have applied for the federal government's Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).  She said slightly more than 750,000 applications were filed on Tuesday alone, for a total of 1.72 million since Monday, when people born in January, February and March were asked to start applying.  Trudeau reiterated at his daily briefing that the federal government is working to help people in the so-called gig economy who currently don't qualify for CERB \u2014 those who work less than 10 hours a week.\nWATCH | Unemployment in Alberta could hit 25%:\nHorgan\u00a0also talked about the province's progress in slowing the spread of the disease and addressed the question of what needs to be done to ensure cases aren't imported from abroad.\u00a0\n\"We want to make sure that everyone has a plan to self-isolate,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSpeaking to reporters later Wednesday afternoon,\u00a0Horgan said the plan will have to\u00a0explain, in detail, how the person plans to self-isolate for 14 days under the Quarantine Act. It\u00a0will be considered a legal document, and\u00a0must be approved by officials in order for the passenger to continue forward.\nIf the traveller does not have a plan, Horgan said a \"quarantine\u00a0site\" will be prepared until they \"can get themselves together.\"\nIf people do not create a plan, the premier said they will spend their two-week isolation period at the site.\nWATCH | Trudeau's self-isolation is over:\nHere's a look at what's happening in Canada and around the world.\u00a0\nAs of 6:30 p.m.\u00a0ET on Wednesday, Canada had 19,291\u00a0confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19.

But the number of new infections and hospital admissions is starting to show signs of flattening, Stephen Powis, medical director of the National Health Service, told the news conference.\nSpain's Health Ministry reported Wednesday 757 new deaths of patients with coronavirus and 6,180 new confirmed infections. Both figures were slightly higher than Tuesday's, when the first increase in five days was explained by a backlog of test results and fatalities that had gone unreported over the weekend. But doubts about the statistics are growing as fresh data starts to emerge.\nAuthorities in Spain have already acknowledged that a scarcity of testing kits and a bottleneck in the number of tests that laboratories can conduct on a daily basis are giving an underestimated contagion tally, which rose to 146,000 on Wednesday. A nationwide survey of 30,000 households has been launched to figure out what is the more approximate extent of the epidemic beyond hospitals and nursing homes.\nIn Italy,\u00a0the hardest-hit country of all with over 17,000 deaths, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday that Italy must stick with its rigid lockdown, rejecting calls from businesses in the country's northern industrial heartland urging the government to allow them to reopen as soon as next week.

India has put its entire population, one-fifth of the worlds' population, under lockdown until April 14.\nJapan saw its biggest daily jump in infections on the first day of a state emergency aimed at containing the outbreak. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was previously criticized for taking so long to declare an emergency, while \u2014 in most cases \u2014 Japanese authorities have no penalties to back calls for people to stay home and businesses to shut.

'Where are the seats that I can win to produce a majority government?'\" said University of Calgary political scientist Anthony Sayers.\nNo doubt, Justin Trudeau and his re-elected party will first try to please voters in Ontario. Then Quebec. Then B.C. Then, in rough order, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, P.E.I., Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Yukon and Saskatchewan.\nFinally, stubbornly conservative Alberta.\nWhat will matter more than Monday's results, however, are the agreements made among\u00a0the various parties that will prop up a Liberal minority and under what conditions. It is these agreements that will determine just what impact the election will have on Alberta.\nEven so, the odds that the next government will fulfil Albertans'\u00a0fondest wishes by booting the tanker ban on a portion of the West Coast, ditching the federal carbon tax and repealing\u00a0the Liberals' environmental review legislation\u00a0are likely non-existent.\nFirst, a note to the reader.\u00a0\nThis will be written as though Alberta is a sort of monolith. That's because the majority vote Conservative, and so it's assumed Albertans are conservative and all want the same thing. Despite the stereotypes, that's not true.\u00a0\nThat said, the majority view and the attendant conservative policies will be taken as a de facto classification for what Alberta wants \u2014 and that means, generally, these things are paramount.\nPipelines.\nEnergy.\nThe economy.\nSo, what's likely to happen in the coming days and weeks?\nTrudeau's party could form official coalitions with any one of the other four parties with seats,\u00a0meaning a cabinet with members from the Liberals and whoever else has signed on.\u00a0\nWhile common in the rest of the democratic world, in Canada a coalition is rare and unlikely.\u00a0\nMore likely is some form of agreement between the Liberals and one or more other parties that essentially says they'll support the government in confidence votes to keep it in power, but might defeat separate bills.\u00a0\nThat can be formalized, or a bit more back-of-the-napkin in nature.\u00a0\nStephen Harper managed to get quite a bit done while managing two consecutive Conservative minorities from 2006 to 2011\u00a0\u2014 mainly by making agreements on the fly, on issues like the current equalization formula and boutique tax breaks.\u00a0\nCurrently, there are plenty of matters on the minds of the majority of Albertans, from equalization payments that redistribute wealth across Canada, to what to do about the continued stagnation of Alberta's oil patch.\u00a0Perhaps top of the list: the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\u00a0\nCoalitions and partnerships will have a profound effect on what's discussed and how it's dealt with, if at all.\u00a0\nDespite having the highest incomes in the country, unemployment remains stubbornly high in Alberta compared to the rest of Canada and it's becoming clear that the boom times and oil and gas jobs that produced staggering wealth in the province aren't likely to return to pre-oil crash levels.\u00a0\nThat has produced anger and anxiety in the province.\u00a0\nMany of the policies that Albertans have blamed for the continued downturn, however, are unlikely to change after Monday's election.\u00a0\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline, which the Liberals purchased for $4.5 billion, is tied up in the courts, but it's difficult to imagine Trudeau killing it.\u00a0\nDespite opposition to pipelines, Sayers doesn't think the federal New Democrats would force the matter if they helped prop up the Liberal minority.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said during the campaign that any party looking to partner up would have to consider the NDP's\u00a0series of\u00a0priorities in order to work together: creating universal pharmacare, investing in housing, waiving interest on student loans, committing to reduce emissions, ending subsidies for oil companies and delivering aid to oilpatch workers to transition them to a new economy, increasing taxes on the wealthiest Canadians and closing tax loopholes, and reducing cellphone bills.\u00a0\nMissing from his demands were any mention of pipelines and Trans Mountain in particular, despite his opposition to the project.\u00a0\nThen, there's the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nOf course, Alberta and Quebec often see eye to eye when it comes to more power for the provinces. But the Bloc is also antagonistic to pipelines. It wants the federal government to sell the Trans Mountain pipeline and wants to see strong legislation on the environment.\n\"If the Bloc is holding the balance of power and they're solely interested in Quebec's interests, who are the biggest recipients of equalization, you know, that's a very different calculation than even if the NDP is holding the balance of power,\" said pollster Janet Brown.\nUnlikely to happen is repeal of Bill C-69, which clarifies what is required for approval of major industrial projects. Opponents like Alberta Premier Jason Kenney decry it as the \"no more pipelines act.\" The province has mounted a constitutional challenge against the legislation.\u00a0\nAlso unlikely? Repeal of Bill C-48, which bans tanker traffic on a stretch of Canada's West Coast, but wouldn't affect Trans Mountain.\u00a0\nAll of that will surely contribute to the overheated anger and rhetoric in Alberta, but what could be done to calm it?\nIn a word: not much.\u00a0\nAlberta has long relished flinging mud at the Laurentian elites of Central Canada. It's a storied pastime, not without merit, to grumble about the province's lot in Confederation.\u00a0\nThere have been political upswells, from the socialist prairie populists angry at the price of grain and the railways to the more recent rise of the Reform Party (which morphed and merged into the Conservative Party of Canada).\nNow the anger is more nebulous and, according to political scientist Melanee Thomas from the University of Calgary, stoked by political parties for short-term gain.\u00a0\n\"This is an elite-driven narrative,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"The prize with this particular election now, where it's kind of like what can we say that will basically be the message for 2019 that will help us win both elections? And a lot of this is just: these people are against Alberta.\"\nIn the end, the narrative worked for the Alberta election and the federal one.\u00a0\nBut that kind of genie bottle is difficult to recork.\nUniversity of Alberta political scientist Jared Wesley said he's not sure a Conservative federal government can meet the \"nebulous demands of the Western populist movement.\"\nHe researches campaign rhetoric in the west and how leaders in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta present themselves in relation to the rest of Canada.\u00a0\nHe says the feeling in his focus groups has shifted from Alberta being held back to the province being left behind by Canada and the rest of the world.\u00a0\n\"That starts to bring in feelings and sentiment \u2014 worry, anxiety, alienation, resentment, rage \u2014 that we've seen in other parts of the world, including the United States,\" he said.\u00a0\nAccording to Wesley, the rust belt states like Michigan where the primary industry has collapsed could provide a more realistic parallel for Alberta than Texas.\u00a0\nThe question is whether anyone, or any party, can fix what ails Alberta and its main source of income.\nWesley sees regionalism and partisanship melding \"into a really potent force.\"\nThat kind of thinking and the divisiveness that has been exposed by the recent campaign and the years leading up to it, all point to one thing: the need for a national vision and someone capable of inspiring the regions to band together.\u00a0\nWho, and what, can achieve that?\nThis is the part of the narrative that requires the little shrugging emoji.\u00a0\nSayers says there are no policies on the table that could become the great unifier. Instead, he argues it has to be a metaphysical plea for a Canada that is stronger together.\n\"I think between now and the next election, which I assume will happen pretty quickly, it's going to be pretty tumultuous and there's not an obvious [unifying force] other than the claim that we are better off together than we are divided,\" he said.\n\"And I'm not sure who is capable amongst the current crop of leaders to really pursue that vision.\"\nIt will also be difficult for the current Alberta government to work with any minority government that doesn't have the Conservatives at the head.\u00a0\nKenney has campaigned for federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's party in Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, and has openly said it would be difficult to work with another Trudeau-led government.\u00a0\nHe has threatened to hold a referendum on equalization \u2014 a legally non-binding exercise \u2014 if bills C-69 and C-48 aren't tossed and a pipeline built.\u00a0\nHeck, his party sent out an email telling supporters they should protest Trudeau's visit to Calgary last Saturday night.\nMeanwhile, if Quebec feels shorted, it could ratchet up separatist sentiment.\u00a0\nSayers hopes the election provides a moment of pause where Canadians realize they can't keep going down the route they're going and that big conversations come from that pause.\u00a0\n\"Politicians have seen the writing on the wall, that if we don't work together here, things are going to look pretty nasty,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"And that's the moment, it's like the '95 referendum and these things, that I think we'll be looking for a moment of 'gee, you know, if we carry on allowing this fragmentation to get worse, we will end up in a really bad spot.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Coronavirus: Here's what's happening in Canada and the world March 19", "description": "PM talks about need for increased testing, travel restrictions between Canada and U.S.", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-covid-19-canada-world-march19-1.5502505", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5502521.1584612588!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cda-coronavirus-20200318.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 6:57 AM ET", "2020-03-20T12:00:20.049Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The latest:\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke about the struggles of Canadians abroad and the need to step up testing for COVID-19 on Thursday,\u00a0a day after announcing an $82-billion COVID-19 response package that includes measures ranging from wage subsidies and income supports to a temporary boost to the child benefit program.\nCanada has more than 800\u00a0confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, an illness caused by the novel\u00a0coronavirus that first emerged in China.

Also on Thursday, a northern Italian town whose cemetery has been overwhelmed began loading bodies into trucks to move them to neighbouring provinces.\nItaly reached its bleak milestone the same day that Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged three months ago, recorded no new infections\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a sign that the communist country's draconian lockdowns were a powerful method to stop the virus' spread.\u00a0\nThe United Nations and Italian health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy's high toll, key among them its large elderly population, who are particularly susceptible to developing serious complications from the virus. Italy has the world's second-oldest population after Japan's and the vast majority of Italy's dead \u2014 87 per cent\u00a0\u2014 were over age 70.\nIn addition, virtually all of Italy's dead had one or more underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension or renal insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Italy still has far fewer confirmed cases than China \u2014\u00a041,035 as of Thursday, compared to more than 80,900 in China.\nSchools in Italy are likely to remain closed beyond April 3, Italy's education minister said on Thursday. \"As Prime Minister [Giuseppe] Conte said, I think we are going toward\u00a0an extension of the April 3 deadline,\" Lucia Azzolina told SkyTG24.

Sign up here\u00a0and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday.\nFiat Chrysler wants to merge with France's Renault, a deal that would create the world's third-largest automaker behind Volkswagen and Toyota if approved.\nBut it's more of a shotgun wedding than a fairy-tale romance.\nFiat Chrysler, which was itself created by a 2014 takeover, is coming off a dismal first quarter, with the number of vehicles shipped down 14 per cent from the year before, and profit falling by 47 per cent.\nRenault's net profits plunged by 37 per cent last year as the company's hopes of a formal merger with Japan's Nissan fell apart in the wake of financial misconduct charges against Carlos Ghosn, the French executive who had been running both the firms.\nThe newly proposed Fiat Chrysler-Renault merger might well make sense \u2014 the two companies could save billions in research, purchasing and production costs, and gain strength in markets where they have been struggling on their own.\nWhat it really underlines, however, is how much difficulty the auto sector finds itself in as it tries to cope with trade wars, slumping sales and changing consumer tastes.\nGlobally, light vehicle sales fell just half a per cent in 2018, but that was the first drop since the 2009 financial meltdown, and a harbinger of what looks to be an even worse 2019.\nAuto sales in Canada were down 3.5 per cent in April from the year before, the 14th straight month of declines.\nOverall sales in the United States were down about the same, although certain brands fared much worse, with Mazda reporting a 14 per cent drop, Fiat Chrysler down by 6 per cent and Toyota 4.4 per cent.\nThe much bigger worry is China, the world's largest market, where sales fell almost 15 per cent last month, suggesting the 2.8 per cent overall drop in 2018 was just the beginning.\nAnd India, another huge emerging car market, saw a 15.9 per cent reduction in April, the 10th straight month in which auto sales have declined.\nCars have been getting more expensive for a while\u00a0as automakers cut back on incentives,\u00a0 but if Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on autos and parts from Europe and Asia, prices will only go higher. The major car makers predict\u00a0an average hike of $2,750 US per domestically made vehicle \u2014 and as much as $6,000 for each import.\nAuto companies have already begun to shed workers as they try to deal with the sales slump and brace for an unpredictable future.\nFord, which is in the midst of an $11 billion US restructuring, announced last week that it will trim 7,000 people from its global workforce.\nBloomberg tallied up all the recent announced cuts \u2014 including 2,300 GM jobs in Oshawa, Ont. \u2014\u00a0and found that the major automakers have tossed 38,000 people over the past six months.\nIt's a worldwide problem.\nDaimler, which announced 10,000 layoffs last month, is getting ready for another major shakeup as it tries to reduce costs by 20 per cent.\nToyota, Honda and Nissan are all forecasting lower sales and profits as they try to shift their focus to electric vehicles and autonomous cars.\nAnd even the cutting-edge firms are struggling. Tesla Motors laid off more than 1,000 employees from its California plant in January, as it tries to deal with longstanding production issues and slowing sales.\nElon Musk's company reported a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and then announced plans to seek more cash by issuing $650 million in new shares and take on an additional $1.35 billion in debt.\nAt the current spend rate, those funds will last Tesla 10 months.\nSo far this year, Tesla stock has shed more than 35 per cent of its value, now trading at around $190 US \u2014 although Musk isn't really hurting. He's still worth an estimated $18.1 billion US, making him the 40th richest billionaire in the world.\nA dance program called Outside Looking In is making a big difference in the lives of a group of dedicated high-school students, producer Sharon Wu writes.\nNo cellphones, no pop or chips, no staying up late or sleeping in \u2026 just six to eight hours of practice each day for 14 straight days.

Everyone is welcome, but those who want to stay on must maintain an average of 60 per cent or better in school, and show that they're both a well-mannered kid and a good dancer. \u00a0\nOver the past 12 years, those who completed the OLI program have a high school graduation rate of 96 per cent, almost three times the national average for Indigenous high school students.\nAll the hard work paid off for the dancers we spoke to at the barn studio near Toronto. Solomon, Rayna and their group took the centre stage at the Sony Centre last week and charmed an audience of nearly 3,000 with their sassy hip hop dance moves. The show lasted for two hours, and ended in hugs and tears.\n\"At that moment I was really proud of myself that I did a HELL of good job,\" says Solomon.\nWatch the story we're calling \"It's More Than Just Dance\" tonight on The National.\n- Sharon Wu\nSenior producer Adam Miller reflects on the death of a tireless harm-reduction advocate who provided an inside look at the overdose crisis.\nWe arrived at Toronto's Moss Park overdose prevention site on a dreary night in November, not knowing what to expect.\nCBC News reporter Nicole Ireland, photographer Evan Mitsui and I were there for a story about startling new data we'd received showing a 2,000 per cent increase in the number of street drugs testing positive for fentanyl across Canada from 2012 to 2017.\nWe were soon connected with Leon Alward, better known as \"Pops\" to the community there, who was both upfront and honest about his heroin and fentanyl use, and generous with his time.\nPops volunteered with the Toronto Overdose Prevention Society's Moss Park site since its inception in August 2017, helping to reduce and reverse overdoses. He was also an advocate for those who couldn't be saved.\nHe also openly referred to himself as a \"junkie,\" because in his words: \"I don't like to pretty it up.\"\nAlthough we only spent a short time with him, Pops showed us around the site and introduced us to people who relied on it. He also gave us the stories behind the park's memorials to users who had lost their battle with addiction \u2013\u00a0some before the site had officially opened.\nThe street drug data we had unearthed came as no surprise to Pops. By the time we spoke to him, the harm-reduction workers at the site had watched over almost 2,000 injections and stopped or reversed about 85 overdoses. The site has since grown from tents, to a full brick-and-mortar operation.\nThere were 308 opioid overdose deaths in Toronto that year, according to Toronto Public Health, and while the full picture for 2018 has not yet been revealed, preliminary data shows there were 193 deaths in Toronto in the first nine months. This year so far, data released by the Toronto Paramedic Services shows 127 suspected opioid overdose calls that resulted in fatalities.\nPops is counted among them. He died of an overdose May 25 in Toronto.\nWe lost one of our original members yesterday to an overdose. Leon \u201cPops\u201d Alward. He fought hard for a response to overdose and joined us on day one in Moss Park as we set up the tents. We are collectively heartbroken by this loss. It\u2019s relentless. \ud83d\udc94 we love you Pops. <a href=\"https://t.co/iMO7k1d1VH\">pic.twitter.com/iMO7k1d1VH</a>\nWhen we spoke with him in 2017, he asked if he could use heroin in our presence \u2013 giving us a firsthand look at the realities of the issue. We agreed, and what transpired was both incredibly moving and eye opening, but also raw and real.\n\"The thought of the sickness that I know is going to come if I don't use far outweighs the risk of using,\" he said. \"It sounds ridiculous, I know that, I understand that. But for an IV user, nobody knows what it's like.\"\nYesterday \u2018Pops\u2019 died of an overdose. He was a courageous man who saved countless lives working at overdose prevention sites in Toronto. Everyday. Every single damn day people are dying of preventable deaths. They are our family members &amp; friends, our colleagues &amp; neighbours.\nWhile he didn't survive his addiction, he was candid about the realities of being a user, and his memory lives on in the community he made such a difference in.\n\"Every time we use, we're taking our lives into our hands,\" he said. \"What we're looking at is people's lives. That's me.\"\n- Adam Miller\nWatch The National's\u00a0inside look at the Moss Park overdose prevention site:\nJoy.\nToronto Raptors are headed to the NBA finals for the first time in history and fans across Canada celebrated their epic win. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMoment?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheMoment</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/18KGfzKWYT\">pic.twitter.com/18KGfzKWYT</a>\n\"With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal.

As candidates were announced, CBC provided each an opportunity to answer a questionnaire tackling a wide range of subjects, from their own qualifications to themes impacting their riding and the territory as a whole.\nRead their responses below, presented in the order they were received by CBC.\nSome answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI wanted to get involved in municipal politics, initially, in 2015. I broached the subject with my father, who immediately suggested I'm far better suited for territorial politics. He knew I was passionate about not only Yellowknife, but the entire North.\n\"I've seen you in action, kid.\u00a0I know you bring people together to help make a real difference. You are well respected in the North, and Yellowknife, which really needs champions like you.\"\nIt took everything I had to maintain my composure. I made a promise to him that day:\u00a0\"Dad, if I even enter politics, I promise you I will do so with compassion, dignity, honesty, respect and represent the people who elect me into office, if successful.\"\nHis response was simple: \"I know you will.\"\nHearing these words from the man I respect most was surreal. The confidence he instilled in me was immeasurable.\nWhen I got back to Yellowknife, I was prepared to enter the territorial election and was just starting to research what that entailed, the roles and responsibilities, etc. Three\u00a0weeks afterwards, I received a call that anyone would dread.\n\"Jan, dad passed away last night.\"\u00a0\nI was in complete disbelief and stunned. I was just talking face to face with him three\u00a0weeks ago.\u00a0Needless to say, my drive to enter politics was shattered. I didn't have it me anymore. I was devastated, angry and sad.\nRoll forward four\u00a0years and that drive is back, alive and stronger than it has ever been.\u00a0\nMy passion for our North and her people is strong. I want to make and be the difference in people's lives, for the better. I want to bring people together at a time when it's needed most. We need to drive positive change collectively, and more importantly, co-operatively. To be able to fulfill a promise I made to my father is a dream I want to turn into reality.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nMy entire life, I've been a leader, team builder and decision maker. My passion for positive change is deeply entrenched in my blood stream. I have over 30 years experience in the GNWT, two\u00a0decades of which are directly in the heart of health care, at Stanton, in the\u00a0IT field.\u00a0\nI was president of a territorial sport organization for over 10 years, have been a member of territorial and national committees, chaired a western Canadian committee and most importantly, I lead by example. I'm not one to sit on the fence.\u00a0I'm decisive and here for the people of Yellowknife and the North.\nI'm also open to correction if fact-based, majority constituency desired, or scientifically-backed information is brought to my attention. I actively support open debate.\nI have already made positive changes in the North by volunteering well over 10,000 hours and raising more than\u00a0$250,000 for several NGO's. I am committed to community and have helped many. This is how I was raised. I intend to bring this same energy to the Legislative Assembly and BE the difference our North needs.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nPractising what I preach, walking my talk, committing\u00a0to my community and living by example. I've had so many people reach out and thank me for inspiring them to make positive lifestyle changes and living a more positive life, in general.\u00a0\nIn 2015, I made a conscious effort to live better and focus on increasing better lifestyle choices. I have shared this ongoing journey in person and on Facebook and many have reached out to let me know what a difference my journey has made in their lives. It has encouraged them to embrace a healthier lifestyle and volunteer in their community.\u00a0\nI wish to continue this type of legacy at a level where I can reach more people. This is, by far, the best human quality, period.\u00a0\nThe number of hours volunteered and dollars raised is one that I am very proud of, as is representing Canada, the N.W.T., and Yellowknife, with dignity and honour on the world stage and nationally.\u00a0\nI changed the conversation with Broomball Canada. All of their materials, (coaches' and officials' manuals, bylaws, constitution, etc.) only had references to provinces throughout. I ensured all future revisions contained the word territories. All of the documents and the language at meetings have since been modified with the proper references:\u00a0provinces/territories. I can enact change at the most fundamental levels.\nEverything I've had the opportunity to be involved in directly has seen improvements.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nHealth and social issues are the largest issue facing the North. Cost of living and the economy are also substantial issues facing the North. They are all equally significant and important.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nCost of living and lack of available recreational lots.\u00a0\nWe need to be able to reduce the cost of living by doing a better job with rebates that everyone can afford, not the few. Not everyone can afford $15,000 to switch over to propane, so these incentives reach but a few. The intention is excellent, but in reality, it needs to be improved so more residents can access this funding.\nThe lottery for recreational lots was an obvious indicator of the need for more lots. People want to enjoy our amazing wilderness and teach children what it's like to re-energize with nature. Nature is good for the soul.\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nImproving the health and social well being of northerners. This is a colossal task that will require engaging multiple groups and every government. When we work together, we can accomplish amazing feats for our most important resource:\u00a0our people. But it will take collaboration among many. I've extensive experience building teams, so this is a task I could lead.\nWe also need to see additional funding from the federal government for wellness programs, especially 'on the land' programs. We are seeing fabulous gains from other communities embracing this structure of healing. Cambridge Bay is a fabulous example.\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nHydroelectricity will bring cheaper power to all northerners. It would significantly reduce GHG emissions and\u00a0allow communities to drastically reduce their dependency on diesel.\nWe need to offer better incentives for residents wanting to embrace cleaner energy solutions:\u00a0wood pellet, solar, small windmill technologies, conversion to propane, to name a few. Open the territory up for green energy companies wanting to test cold climate energy solutions. Research other circumpolar communities for solutions that work in their cold climate environment.\nI would also like to see more greenhouses developed in the communities to ensure better food security and less transportation of food supplies.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nMore accountability and more transparency for all GNWT programs. We don't know how successful, or not, the existing programs within the GNWT are if they aren't measured. Are we wasting money on programs that are not being utilized? Are there two programs offering the same services? Can we combine programs that cross over? We just don't know until they are measured.\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nWe need to streamline the resource development application process. At present, it is horrendously cumbersome, bureaucratic and time consuming. It deters exploration companies from investing in the North, providing much needed jobs. This must be done while maintaining cultural and environmental stewardship.\u00a0\nWe also need to diversify our economy by expanding tourism, agricultural, and\u00a0commercial fishing opportunities. The South Slave and Deh Cho regions could feed the North with their fertile soil.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe could bring portable sawmills into the smaller communities to create fire barriers and utilize the harvested wood for building more public housing. The by-product can be turned into wood pellets. This will create much needed employment.\nWithout diversifying with out of the box solutions, we will witness stagnant growth, if at all.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nWe have to ensure the Indigenous people and governments are at the table, period. We must be inclusive, transparent and work closer together to come up with made in the North solutions. I've mentioned some already (above).\nWe need face to face meetings on a regular basis and to collaborate with one another to come up with solutions that benefit all people. The GNWT must recognize that Indigenous culture needs to be a factor in all the decisions.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position? \nVery likely, if this is something members feel I would be suited for. I would look to the health and\u00a0social services portfolio, which I fully recognize is significant. I have extensive experience, over two decades, directly in the health industry, so who better to represent health issues\u00a0than a member who has worked in the industry, specifically in the hospital.\nWould you like to be premier? \nNot at this stage. I would consider it after fulfilling the first four-year term.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI believe the GNWT has lost sight of larger ideals and putting a vision forward that reflects the true potential of all our citizens. I want a territory where our largest corporations are owned and operated here and compete for contracts across the North, as opposed to the status-quo of southern and foreign ownership sending money out of territory.\nWe are on a tipping point, where the GNWT must take action to become more adaptable to change\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not only climate change, but adapting to a global economy with increasing inequality, while navigating to the closure of the diamond mines. The Northwest Territories has one of the highest rates of income inequality in Canada, especially between our Indigenous and non-Indigenous population.\nAs a lawyer working in government I felt I was part of the problem and not part of the solution. I found my co-workers either overworked or unmotivated. In seeing no one step up and put forward a vision and progressive agenda, I felt I was in between a rock and a hard place. Continue to be a participant in a misled government, or run and give those who want to ensure our government can adapt a voice.\u00a0\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nAs a lawyer, I have spent years working firsthand with legislation. Most recently, as a senior adviser, legislation and legal affairs at\u00a0the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, I helped develop legislation from the policy research to drafting stage, working closely with Indigenous governments.\nI have no doubt I will be one of the strongest legislators in the assembly, something many of our politicians forget is key to the role. I will aim to introduce more private member's bills than any other MLA in history. I have read legislation from across the world and have consistently seen our government miss solutions that are already working in other jurisdictions.\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI am most proud of my role in enacting the Protected Areas Act of the N.W.T. It was humbling to play a role in laying the groundwork for the landmark Thaidene Nene National Park and giving the territory the tools to protect our environment for the future. I just recently received a Deputy Minister's Award for this work.\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nThe biggest issue facing the territory\u00a0is the biggest issue facing the planet: climate change. We are especially vulnerable to the consequences here in the Northwest Territories. Inaction is not an option if we want to protect our economy, keep our communities connected, and maintain our way of life in the future.\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nWhen I go door-to-door, I'm hearing a lot of people who are anxious about the state of our economy. The Conference Board of Canada and Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses agree that our economy is in a tough spot and our territory is one of the worst in Canada for emerging entrepreneurs.\u00a0\nI believe that's in part because our bureaucracy is stifling and inflexible. And that's why I plan to advocate for smart policies to unleash entrepreneurship in our territory, incentivize businesses to come North, and break down the barriers to innovation and economic development.\u00a0\nYellowknife North is an extremely unique riding with so many amazing local businesses. Removing the red tape and government competition they face is key. We have seen the GNWT balloon and start entering into areas of the private sector, stifling our local northern businesses. We must ensure the GNWT is working with local businesses, not against them.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nI would like to implement a pilot project for universal daycare in the N.W.T.\u00a0\nToday, it costs around $1,000 a month for daycare in Yellowknife, and daycare services are not available in many communities.\u00a0\nThis is a huge point of anxiety for families around the territory. And it's a drag on the economy.\u00a0At this price point, many choose not to enter the workforce.\nI want to see a future where people aren't paying more than around 10\u00a0bucks a day for their daycare services to relieve the anxieties of families, and help our territory reach its full potential.\u00a0\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nFirst and foremost, we need to continuously evaluate how our carbon pricing is working, and retarget if our emissions aren't coming down fast enough.\u00a0\nNext, we need to make big investments in clean energy. Right now, the Taltson expansion is one relatively defined way forward, but I also think we need to look outside the box for micro-grid solutions that make sense in each region. By this I mean\u00a0things like small-scale hydro, solar, or wind projects where they make the most sense. We must step back and work with Indigenous governments to let them take the lead in federally funded renewable projects.\nOn the political front, I believe the N.W.T. needs to be an active participant in international discussions by sending our leadership to remind the world that we are disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change. We also need to make sure the GNWT allies with Indigenous governments in this fight \u2060\u2014 there is an incredible amount of traditional knowledge and leadership we would be smart to tap from these organizations.\u00a0\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nI think fundamentally, we need to move our approach to providing public services to a more client-focused model. That means creating a culture of service where the endless telephone tag ends and people get what they need without the headache.\u00a0\nI also think we get failing grades on transparency. I want to see a truly open government, where the public and the press know what's going on in our institutions. I would support looking at our access to information legislation to align our laws to these ambitions.\u00a0\nAnd to complement that, I want to get citizens more involved in our policy deliberations. Most provinces have a public engagement division driving this forward, and I think it's high time we make that investment in citizen participation.\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nOne opportunity we're missing out on right now in the territory is building a knowledge economy. I think a big part of finding success on that front will be building a polytechnic university in Yellowknife as its hub.\u00a0\nIn order for the university to succeed, it can't just be a re-branded Aurora College. We need to offer something unique that is going to attract world-class researchers here, and incentivize innovators to choose the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\nWe already have a lot going for us. Researchers already come here in droves from the University of Alberta and other institutions to study permafrost, climate change, and our huge slice of the Canadian Shield.\u00a0\nThis is a solid foundation for us to build a cutting-edge university around which a new economy can thrive.\u00a0\nI also think we need to go big on tourism.\u00a0\nWe have a lot of catching up to do compared to our neighbours in Yukon. While their highways are dotted with immaculate, engaging tourism infrastructure, ours sometimes make the news for offering tourists very different experiences.\u00a0\nI want to see transformative investments in tourism infrastructure across the territory so guests from around the world have they amenities they expect from their vacations.\u00a0\nI also want to see an end to unnecessary red tape and an evaluation of our licensing process. I hear too often from people who have an idea for businesses which would offer amazing experiences to visitors, but gave up on their ideas when faced with the bureaucratic process. This aligns with giving municipalities control over their land so they can take the lead in economic development.\u00a0We should be encouraging entrepreneurship, not stifling it.\u00a0\nAnd I believe responsible development is going to play a role in our economic future. While it is largely rooted in market trends, I think we would be smart to bring the rest of our resource management legislation \u2014 the Mackenzie Valley Land and Resource Management Act \u2014 under territorial jurisdiction.\u00a0\nIt's one of the last missing pieces for our territory to truly have control over how our land and resources are managed. That kind of control is going to be important to what our economy looks like in the future.\u00a0\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI believe we need to accelerate our path toward the promise of co-management at the heart of the devolution project.\u00a0\nThat means empowering Indigenous governments to take the reins on managing their own affairs and doing our part to give them the tools to do it effectively. I believe there are numerous steps we can take immediately.\u00a0We just need a GNWT that is willing to give up control, and let Indigenous governments operate free from interference.\u00a0\nBut there's no denying that one of the biggest things we could do to improve our relationship with Indigenous peoples is bringing a respectful, equitable conclusion to our outstanding land claims. This would be a big win for reconciliation and our collective economic fortunes. Once again, the solution here is to realize that the best thing we can do for the territory is allow our Indigenous governments to lead, they are better suited to be flexible and better suited to obtain federal funding. We are leaving millions of dollars in Ottawa by not settling land claims.\u00a0\nAnother big way we can improve this relationship is making a special effort to make sure Indigenous peoples and their governments shape our public policy. This is the least we can do to help right our wrongs and build a government that operates in a way that works for our majority-Indigenous population.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\nNo.\nWould you like to be premier? \nNo. For various reasons I believe it is important that we have an Indigenous premier, especially until such time as land claims and self government agreements are settled.\nWhy did you decide to run for office?\nI was born in Inuvik and I grew up in, and currently live in, the riding of Yellowknife North. I have a deep passion for our city and territory. I'm focused on the opportunities we have to effect change and shape our future. I'm more confident than ever that our future is now and the right time is now for positive and productive change.\nI am running to be your MLA for one reason:\u00a0to build a healthy, sustainable and prosperous territory, where all N.W.T. residents share in the benefits. I have the experience you can count on to make it happen.\nWhat previous experience would you bring to the role of MLA?\nI bring extensive experience from my two terms on city council and four years as MLA for the riding of Yellowknife North. As MLA I was on a number of committees, including the chair of the standing committee on economic development and environment, that conducted extensive reviews of bills, department business plans and annual budgets. I'm a critical thinker and make decisions based on triple bottom line principles.\nI have also owned two successful small businesses, where I have gained an ability for understanding financial statements and fiscal responsibility. I also bring a wealth of experience gained through a number of diverse management roles throughout my working career. I have a reputation for working collaboratively and positively with individuals, NGOs, business and industry, and other orders of government.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?\nI have lived a very good life which has provided me with more than I could ever imagine. I want to be able to give back to our city and territory, as it has given so much to me.\nMy public service over the last 10\u00a0years as a city councillor and MLA has been my proudest accomplishment. My view is that I want to leave this great city and territory in a better state than prior to my contribution. I feel I have done that\u00a0so far, and that's why I continue to say that I am running to build a healthy, sustainable and prosperous territory, where all N.W.T. residents share in the benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think is the biggest issue facing the territory?\nWe are an Indigenous territory that still has unsettled land rights. In order for Indigenous peoples to move toward self-determination and gain more cultural, political and economic autonomy we must settle and finalize those agreements. Then, we can move closer to devolving more responsibility and independence through the self-government agreements that would follow.\nThis is not going to happen overnight, but we must keep heading in a positive direction and bring more certainty for the territory.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the biggest issue in your riding?\nYellowknife North is a diverse riding. In general, the riding is made up of families and individuals that are educated and have good standards of living.\nThat said, the impacts of homelessness, addictions and mental health have always been present in Yellowknife, but recently, the impacts have become increasingly visible within the community. While significant work has been done to address homelessness, addictions and mental-health issues in Yellowknife, individuals and families continue to struggle with these complex and often intertwined problems.\nClose co-operation must continue to be encouraged between the city, GNWT and Canada, because much of the funding available through the federal government is only accessible through such partnerships. The GNWT must step up and re-affirm its leadership on these files.\u00a0\nIf you could accomplish only one thing while in office, what would that be?\nIt would be\u00a0to build an undeniable sense of spirit and pride from within all N.W.T. residents, knowing that they are enjoying the standard of living and quality of life that they have always dreamed of!\nWhat would you like to see the territory do to address the impacts of climate change?\nGreenhouse gas is the largest contributor impacting climate change. Lowering the consumption of energy that is, directly or indirectly, generated by the burning of fossil fuels is typically the first major step that is taken in greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.\u00a0\nThis can be achieved through either just using less energy, increasing the efficiency of the things that consume energy, or increasing the efficiency of the things that create energy,\u00a0particularly electricity. There are several established technologies that are proven in providing clean energy, including\u00a0solar, wind, geothermal and hydro, although they are not without their critics.\u00a0\nNuclear energy is also often touted as a \"clean\" alternative to fossil fuels, although public opinion has been biased against it as a result of high-profile accidents. Wind and solar power generation are viable options for power production in the N.W.T. and are being applied in certain areas. The continued rollout of these technologies should be furthered by the GNWT, with the N.W.T. Power Corporation taking a proactive position regarding green power generation, particularly in those communities still dependent on diesel powered generators.\u00a0Nuclear options should continue to be monitored as new, innovative, safer and most importantly, small scale solutions continue to be developed.\nIn the meantime, existing power generation should be evaluated to utilize cleaner burning fuels, such as natural gas and biodiesel. This should be done in conjunction with evaluating the feasibility of utilizing natural gas resources in the N.W.T. and test piloting certain communities with the use of biodiesel. Where we can, hydro-electric development should always be considered where appropriate, including the further development and utilization of current capabilities.\nReducing energy consumption is the flip-side to more efficiency in energy production.\u00a0This is an area in which the GNWT (through allied agencies such as the Arctic Energy Alliance) has had many years of experience.\u00a0The provision of incentives to Northerners to build more energy efficient homes and to purchase more energy efficient appliances for example, are examples of initiatives that have a proven track record of success.\u00a0More of this is needed.\nImproved efficiency in building construction standards (residential, commercial, and government) should also be regulated and incentivized, where necessary. Reducing actual consumption of energy, both in the home and workplace can now also be assisted by new \"smart home\" technologies.\u00a0 Promotion of their use should also be encouraged.\nWhat would you change about how the government currently operates?\nWe became a government in 1967, over 50 years ago. So much has changed since then: globalization, internet, smartphones, climate change, reconciliation, etc.\nIndustry and business have evolved with all these changes, even municipal governments have redesigned and modernized themselves. While change is happening elsewhere, the GNWT has stayed stuck in the past. This is the age of change, and while all of us are living in the competitive 21st century, our government is still struggling to get out of the 20th.\nOver many years and several assemblies, the GNWT has added many new programs, services and departments. Rarely have we seen any of our departments or agencies downsized or streamlined, much less the reduction\u00a0or removal of\u00a0antiquated programs or services.\nIf anything, we have grown exponentially.\nBefore separation in 1999, we had 2,500 employees looking after the western and eastern Arctic.\u00a0Now, we have 4,600 employees managing the west only. On occasion, we have seen departments amalgamate but that has resulted in a mega-department rather than a downsize. The result: overlapping and even duplicative responsibilities that waste resources and needlessly complicate government.\nThis is why we continually receive a grade of F from CFIB and continue to have an enormous amount of red tape and layers of bureaucracy that no one can navigate. It's also why we struggle to come to terms with our Indigenous partners and settling land rights and self-government agreements.\nWe are a lopsided, top-heavy organization that has no ability to be flexible or pliable enough to adjust with the quick moving pace and changing times of our world. We need to begin a process of re-inventing government where we create a more linear or horizontal organization that puts the resources at the front lines and better serves the residents through efficient and quick responses and effective results that provide long term solutions for residents' needs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat do you think the GNWT must do to improve and protect the territory's economy?\nThe sustainability and growth of the N.W.T. economy requires strategic investment, diversification, and modernization. We also need investment in innovation and technology if we are to work toward a carbon free future.\nMining and exploration will continue to play a significant role in the N.W.T.'s economy. But, in addition, we need to support economic diversification through investment in entrepreneurship and small business, green energy, tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, fisheries and arts and\u00a0film.\nEconomic development must be supported by improved and strengthened skills development for the labour market, so that residents can take advantage of current and future job opportunities and build lasting careers. I believe in a responsible, sustainable and balanced approach to land use. With devolved responsibility for lands and resources, now is the time to work collaboratively with Canada, Indigenous governments, industry and environmental partners to evolve and improve our regulatory system.\nWe need to work together to create the conditions for economic investment, while preserving the values of sustainability. This also means having a strategic response to climate change that recognizes territorial and national emissions targets, while recognizing the realities of our geography and cold climate which drive energy consumption and the cost of living in the North.\nWhat would you do as MLA to improve the GNWT's relationship with Indigenous people?\nI am grateful every day that I have the opportunity to live in this great Indigenous territory. I have the utmost respect and appreciation of all our Indigenous peoples. Going forward, it is essential that our government to government relationships continue to be based on mutual respect, recognition and shared responsibilities.\nTo further strengthen relationships and in the spirit of working toward self-determination, the GNWT must communicate and work with leaders and communities from every region of the territory to discuss ways we can continue to work together. A number of key areas need to be strengthened as we move forward, including\u00a0committing departments to undertake appropriate consultation when proposing actions that may impact on Indigenous governments, and continuing\u00a0the commitment to negotiate and finalize land rights agreements in all regions of the N.W.T.\nWe need to engage in a way that acknowledges the unique governance structures, status of Indigenous rights negotiations, economic opportunities, and culture in each community. As I discovered when travelling through the territory with many pieces of legislation, we need to recognize and contribute to addressing capacity challenges faced by Indigenous governments in terms of human and financial resources that make it difficult for them to effectively engage. We must be open and transparent by committing to sharing information with Indigenous governments. And\u00a0we must continue our commitment to work with all governments to ensure that we make decisions that support a healthy and diverse ecosystem.\nThere is much more we can do, but ultimately we need to do it together so that the positive benefits can be had by all N.W.T. residents.\nIf elected, will you be seeking a cabinet position?\u00a0\nThere are many important roles for all 19 MLAs to fill once elected. I will respect the collective decision making process that takes place to decide who will fill what role and I will give 110 per cent\u00a0no matter what role I am in.\nWould you like to be premier?\nMaybe someday\u2026ha!\n"}]
