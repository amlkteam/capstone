The price of oil fell back after major oil-producing countries struggled to finalize a deal on output cuts.\nEuropean and U.S. markets are closed for Good Friday. The long weekend offers a respite from the drama that has wracked markets for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced, gaining 0.8 per cent\u00a0to close at 19,498.50. In South Korea, the Kospi jumped 1.3 per cent to 1,860.70. Shares also rose in Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. But the Shanghai Composite index lost 1 per cent, to 2,796.63.\nOvernight, in Europe, the countries that use the euro currency agreed on measures that will help each other bear the burden of the costs of the crisis. The package of 500 billion euros (about $550 billion US) does not include, however, a more ambitious proposal to borrow money together.\nEarlier, the U.S. central bank announced programs to provide up to $2.3 trillion US in loans to households, local governments and businesses as the country tips into what economists say may be the worst recession in decades.\nThe Fed's actions completely overshadowed a government report that another 6.6 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week. Stock investors expected such dismal numbers, and some are looking ahead to a possible reopening of the economy.\n\"It looks like the Feds are on a mission to blow holes in every dam that stops the flow of credit. And it sure sounds like they have plenty more dynamite if needed,\" Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. said in a commentary.\nThe stock market is not the economy, and that distinction has become even more clear this week. For the week, the S&P 500 jumped 12.1 per cent, its best performance since late 1974.\nStock investors are continuously looking ahead to where the economy will be a few months or more in the future, which largely depends on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and on the mass shutdowns meant to contain it.\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 39.84 points to 2,789.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2 per cent, to 23,719.37, and the Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent\u00a0to 8,153.58.\nWhile hopes are building that a plateau may be arriving for infections in several hotspots, it's not assured.\nThursday's gains were capped by another downdraft in oil prices, which have collapsed amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nBenchmark U.S. crude oil fell $2.33, or 9.3 per cent, to $22.76 per barrel after investors learned that Russia and members of OPEC had reached a preliminary agreement to reduce production by 10 million barrels a day. That is far short of what would be needed to offset the steep decline in demand because of the coronavirus shutdowns, said Dave Ernsberger, global head of commodities pricing at S&P Global Platts.\nBrent crude fell $1.36, or 4.1 per cent, to $31.48 per barrel.\nOPEC said Friday that approval of the proposal for gradual cuts in output hinges on gaining Mexico's agreement. The Group of 20 major economies will hold a teleconference Friday to further discuss global output.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX and Dow make gains Thursday but coronavirus volatility continues", "description": "Canadian dollar fell to lowest level since 2003 on Wednesday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-dollar-oil-thursday-1.5502601", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306068.1570037864!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 9:36 AM ET", "2020-03-19T20:22:11.460Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stock markets eked out modest gains on Thursday as investors digested new financial support measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus sweeping the globe.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark index was up by 449 points or almost four per cent by the time trading shut down for the day.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 189.63 points, or almost 1 per cent to 20,088.55, the S&P 500 gained slightly less in percentage terms and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up by more than two per cent.\nThough meagre, even those modest gains were welcome news to battered stock investors. Markets have been so volatile because investors are weighing the increasing likelihood of a recession on one hand against huge, emergency efforts to prop up the economy on the other. Markets got more of each on Thursday.\n\"Every day there's another announcement of what the stimulus is going to look like, but what seems to be apparent is the recognition ... that funding is going to have to be larger, more significant than initially expected,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"And that they are prepared to do whatever it takes to cushion the downside of what is increasingly looking like an impending recession.\"\nInvestors also appeared encouraged by reports that China is set to ramp up stimulus spending after the province where the virus first emerged showed no new infections on Wednesday. That likely helped boost the price of U.S. crude oil by almost 24 per cent on\u00a0Thursday, nearly making up all of its losses from the day before, Krosby said, noting that China is one of the world's biggest oil importers.\nThe Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level since 2003 on oil's weakness on Wednesday, dipping below 69 cents US. But rallied somewhat on Thursday as oil recovered.\nStill, the market will likely remain volatile until investors see more economic data that shows just how badly the outbreak is hurting the economy.\n\"They're doing what they can, and I'm not sure what else they can do,\" said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ.\nMajor indexes started the day lower, then rose before and during a late morning news conference led by President Donald Trump to give updates on the outbreak. The gains were mostly gone in early afternoon trading as the indexes turned mixed. The indexes snapped back into the green by mid-afternoon, however.\nEuropean stocks swung from gains to losses and back to gains. Asian markets dropped following the brutal 5.1 per cent\u00a0loss for U.S. stocks the prior day.\nUltimately, investors say they need to see the number of new infections stop accelerating for the market's extreme volatility to ease.\nThe total number of known infections has topped 220,000 worldwide, including nearly 85,000 people who had recovered. The death toll has crept toward 10,000.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems, and recovery could take six weeks in such cases.\nUntil the number of new cases peak, investors will struggle with uncertainty about how much to pay for a stock, bond or commodity when they don't know how long the economic downturn will last. Many economists expect a sharp drop in the economy, but they disagree on how long it will take to bounce back.\nThe hope is that all the emergency actions by central banks and spending by governments can provide support for the economy in the meantime and soften the blow. The Trump administration has pitched lawmakers on a program that could flood $1 trillion into the economy, including checks sent directly to households.\nThe New York Stock Exchange said late Wednesday that it will temporarily close its trading floor and moving to all-electronic trading beginning Monday after two employees tested positive for coronavirus. The exchange has also started medically screening all personnel who enter the building. Much stock trading has gone electronic in recent years, and there are far fewer floor brokers than there used to be.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX takes holiday break near 2009 high", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-takes-holiday-break-near-2009-high-1.848940", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2009 2:30 PM ET", "2009-12-24T19:26:40.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Heading into a four-day holiday break, the Toronto stock market's key index\u00a0gained nearly 100 points Thursday to come within 25 points of its high point for the year.\nFinancials and energy stocks led the way on a quiet\u00a0day of trading as investors digested cautiously optimistic data on the U.S. economy.\nTraders sent the S&P/TSX composite index up 95.91 points to 11,754.61 at the end of a shortened session.\u00a0The TSX closed at 1 p.m. ET\u00a0and will resume trading Tuesday after the Christmas and Boxing Day statutory holidays.\nWall Street returns to work Monday.\nThe Toronto market gained 291 points or 2.54 per cent, this week on rising oil and metal prices and hopes the economic rebound is on track.\nThose hopes increased Thursday after the U.S. Commerce Department showed the manufacturing sector is improving even as orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket durable goods increased less than expected in November.\nThey rose just 0.2 per cent.

Until then, markets have been grasping at guesses about how long businesses will remain shut down, layoffs will soar and flights remain cancelled due to measures meant to slow the spread of the virus.\nThat's why the number of infections and deaths will likely dominate markets more than anything else, particularly this upcoming week, which is relatively light on economic reports, Frederick said.\n\"The virus is not everything, it's the only thing, and nothing else really matters,\" he said.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 175.03, or 7 per cent, to 2,663.68, and nearly all the stocks in the index were higher. It more than recovered all its losses from the prior week, when the government reported a record number of layoffs sweeping the economy.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 1,627.46 points, or 7.7 per cent, to 22,679.99, and the Nasdaq rose 540.15, or 7.3 per cent, to 7,913.24.\n\"Hundreds of people are passing away each day from the pandemic, but less so than previous days, giving markets hope that the lockdown measures are finally starting to prove effective,\" Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.\n\"Like the rest of the world, financial markets are searching for any slivers of hope,\" he said.\nThe S&P 500 is still down more than 22 per cent\u00a0since its record set in February, but the losses have been slowing since Washington promised massive amounts of aid to prop up the economy.\n\"Since this is a public health crisis, the response has been extreme,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a report. \"There are literally no governors on the amount of monetary or fiscal stimulus that will be used in this fight.\"\nIn Japan, the prime minister said Monday that he's preparing to announce a 108 trillion yen ($1 trillion US) package to bolster the world's third-largest economy. It would be Japan's largest-ever package for the economy and nearly twice as much as expected.\nJapan's economy was already shrinking late last year before the outbreak forced the global economy into a protective coma induced by health authorities.\nThe announcement pushed Japan's Nikkei 225 index to surge 4.2 per cent. Elsewhere in Asia, South Kora's Kospi jumped 3.9 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 2.2 per cent\nIn Europe, Germany's DAX returned 4.9 per cent\u00a0and France's CAC 40 jumped 3.8 per cent. The FTSE 100 in London rose 2.4 per cent.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 0.66 per cent\u00a0from 0.58 per cent\u00a0late Friday. Yields tend to rise when investors are raising their expectations for economic growth and inflation.\nCrude oil fell, giving up some of its huge gains from the prior week when expectations rose that Saudi Arabia and Russia may cut back on some of their production.\nDemand for oil has plummeted due to the weakening economy, and any cutback in production would help prop up its price. A meeting between OPEC, Russia and other producers initially planned for Monday, though, was reportedly pushed back to Thursday.\nBenchmark\u00a0U.S. crude fell $1.01 to $27.33 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.09, or 3.2 per cent, to $33.02 per barrel.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX operator mulls merger with London exchange", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-operator-mulls-merger-with-london-exchange-1.1009616", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 08, 2011 5:25 PM ET", "2011-02-09T03:24:07.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The TMX Group, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Toronto Venture exchange, confirmed Tuesday it is in advanced talks with the London Stock Exchange Group on a possible merger.\nA spokeswoman for the TMX Group\u00a0said the companies are considering a deal that would be a merger of equals.

The S&P 500 is on track to move more than 2 per cent\u00a0a fourth straight day, the first time that would have happened since the summer of 2011.\nShort sellers, who make money by betting the market will go down, have had a field day amid all the volatility. Research published Wednesday by analytics firm S3 Partners shows short sellers have made $50 billion US from the sell off since it began last week.\nWatch the video below for an explainer of how short-selling works:\nShort sellers have racked up huge gains by betting against the prices of companies like Tesla, Amazon, Visa, Boeing and Delta during the current market uncertainty\n\"When the markets rebound as the coronavirus effect wanes, we will probably see a pullback in short selling in some of these names as shorts cover to realize their profits,\" S3 said.\nThe growing understanding that the spread of infections may not slow anytime soon is pulling sharply on markets. That pull has taken turns this week with the increasingly worldwide push that authorities are trying to give markets through spending plans and interest-rate cuts.\n\"It's been a roller-coaster market in recent days for equity investors, and today we appear to be on the downward leg for that ride,\" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"What you need is time, and unfortunately that is still going to result in volatility.\"\nIn China, where the number of new infections has been slowing drastically, Shanghai-traded stocks have rallied nearly 12 per cent\u00a0since hitting a bottom on Feb. 3. They're just 1.4 per cent\u00a0below their highest level since the new virus began to spread late last year.\nFactories in China are gradually reopening, and a return to a sense of normal life may even be on the horizon following swift and severe actions by the government to corral the virus.\nBut elsewhere in the world, the mood is much darker. There are about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it, according to the World Health Organization. Widening outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran are responsible for the majority of new infections.\nIn the U.S., the death toll climbed to 11 due to the virus. California declared a statewide emergency late Wednesday. Southwest Airlines on Thursday warned its investors that it's seen a significant decline in demand in recent days and an increase in customers cancelling trips.\n\"The Western world is now following some of China's playbook, closing schools and declaring a state of emergency for example, but there is a sense that this is too little, too late,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.\nTravel-related companies continued to fall sharply on worries that frightened customers won't want to confine themselves in planes or boats with others. Royal Caribbean Cruises sank 15.8 per ent, Carnival fell 13.2 per cent\u00a0and American Airlines Group lost 11.1 per cent.\nIt's a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when a resilient stock market kept climbing to new highs on the hopes that the virus may remain contained in China and be just a short-term challenge.\nNow that a growing list of companies are warning about how the virus is hitting their sales and profits, investors are left with a lot of uncertainty about just how much economic growth and corporate profits will be affected.\n\"We could probably drive a metaphorical truck between the upside and downside cases here,\" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "TSX shut down for 'technical halt' as stock markets sell off", "description": "Company that owns and operates exchange says systems will be ready for Friday", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-thursday-1.5477966", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5478023.1582832345!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/anxious-stock-trader.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Feb 27, 2020 11:40 AM ET", "2020-02-28T05:58:51.741Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The company that owns and operates the Toronto Stock Exchange ordered a \"technical halt\"\u00a0to all trading on Canada's largest stock exchange on Thursday, a day when stock markets around the world saw heavy losses.\nTMX Corp. ordered the halt a little before\u00a02 p.m. ET on Thursday, citing a \"problem with order entry\" on the main index, the TSX Venture Exchange and the alternative Alpha Exchange.

He also reminded Canadians that steps have been taken to ensure people can stay home from work and that, despite running federal deficits, Canada remains in a strong position to act if necessary.\u00a0\nMorneau also said he would be speaking with the U.S. Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steven Mnuchin\u00a0and some Canadian banking leaders to make sure the government retains the capacity to respond as necessary.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX ends down after wild swings in markets", "description": "Dow see-saws 400 points in less than an hour", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/tsx-ends-down-after-wild-swings-in-markets-1.982729", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1936987.1381378213!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/li-markets-friday620-getty1.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 05, 2011 1:38 AM ET", "2011-08-06T00:20:47.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "North American markets\u00a0took investors on a wild ride Friday as the Toronto Stock Exchange\u00a0closed\u00a0with a loss of more than 200 points,\u00a0while\u00a0the Dow, after\u00a0seesawing 400 points in less than an hour, finished with a gain.\nMarkets\u00a0opened higher after a stronger than expected report on U.S. employment for July, then retreated sharply\u00a0before gaining again as\u00a0European leaders\u00a0reached a deal with Italy\u00a0on fiscal reforms\u00a0that promised to ease concerns about the spread of Europe's debt crisis.\nToward the end of the session, most indices began falling again.\nUnder the terms of the deal, the Italian government has agreed to\u00a0speed up its attempts to balance its budget.\nIn return, reports said, the European Central Bank\u00a0will buy Italian and Spanish bonds to pump cash into their economies.\nIn Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite index closed\u00a0down 217.96 points, or 1.8 per cent, at 12,162.17.

Investor doubts are also growing about the whole European decision-making process.\nOn a positive note, the U.S. Labour Department's non-farm payrolls report said employment rose by 117,000 in July, higher than the approximately 80,000 additional jobs that economists had expected. Also, the jobless rate edged down 0.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent.\nThe data came out a day after pessimism over the U.S. economy and\u00a0Europe's debt problems pushed markets to major losses.\nFollowing the Labour Department's report, U.S. President Barack Obama called on Congress to take measures when it returns in September to further ease unemployment. He called for extensions to a payroll tax-credit program meant to spur job creation and to unemployment insurance benefits.

We certainly have history as a guide for how other epidemics have played out, but the numbers in this particular epidemic are much larger and the world is a different place than it was even if you compare it with SARS.\"\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control announced that a patient in California had contracted the virus without having travelled\u00a0anywhere known to have the virus, nor being exposed to anyone who was known to be affected.\nThis raised questions about how many people this person could have affected\u00a0without\u00a0knowing it.\n\"And so, right now, we're dealing at a point of what I would call maximum uncertainty,\" said Marks.\nIn the midst of that uncertainty, market watchers are trying to figure out what might happen next and are looking to China for examples.\nAlthough Beijing ended the extended holiday on Feb.\u00a010, it took time for factories to restart in part because workers were restricted in their movement. Those factories are still thought to be operating under capacity\n\"I think a rational person using the base case right now is expecting that our lives are going to be significantly disrupted for a period of time and then it will be over,\" said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Financial.\n\"But you know whether that means we have to work from home or we're not going to go to the shopping mall and we're certainly not going to travel to Italy. So maybe our summer plans are off. This is what people are trying to gauge.\"\nSchwartz said that he expects a broad swath\u00a0of businesses to be affected if COVID-19 gains a foothold in North America because people would choose to stay home.\u00a0\n\"Every business, in my opinion, is going to suffer. Even the dentist. I'm not going to leave the house. I'm not going to go to the dentist office. People are going to be staying at home more and avoiding crowds and leaving their house and that's fine, we'll get past that. Probably the only company that will do fine here is Netflix,\" predicted\u00a0Schwartz.\nThere are indicators in\u00a0Asia that could\u00a0show how economies start to recover after the virus peaks and begins to ebb.\nIn an interview, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple's factories are restarting\u00a0in China as spread of the virus is brought under control. As well,\u00a0Starbucks announced that 85 per cent of its Chinese locations have reopened.\n\"I think all the demand that we've lost here will recover,\" said Schwartz. \"It's just really tough living through it.\"\nWritten and produced by Tracy Johnson.

The company has submitted a detailed remediation plan to Health Canada and expects to complete the work described in the plan by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nIn the wake of its disclosure of illicit cultivation, the company fired its CEO \"with cause\" and asked its chairman to resign after the board discovered new information during an internal investigation.\nThe company's shares surged briefly on Oct. 15 when it announced plans to destroy $77 million worth of cannabis plants and inventory as part of its efforts to comply with Health Canada regulations.\nCannTrust announced Oct. 25 that it was laying off as many as 140 people \u2014 roughly one quarter of its workforce \u2014 while it works to regain its federal licences to sell and produce pot.\nIt said the cuts were expected to result in monthly cash savings of about $400,000 and cost up to $800,000 in severance payments if the employees are not recalled within 35 weeks.\nThe legal cannabis sector has struggled since Canada legalized the product in October of 2018, suffering from supply shortages and a lack of retail outlets, particularly in Ontario.\nCannTrust shares were down five cents, or 4.46 per cent, at $1.07 in midday trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX moves lower after Friday's steep slide", "description": "Dow and tech stocks fall in New York", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/monday-markets-1.5070366", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5068709.1553292872!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-year-end-20181231.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 25, 2019 12:54 PM ET", "2019-03-25T21:06:00.552Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Investors were taking a cautious approach on Monday after Friday's steep slide in stock indexes, with shares down in Toronto and mixed in New York.\nAt the close, the TSX was down 23 points at 16,065, with heavily weighted energy shares pulling the market lower.\nOn Friday, the index had its worst day of 2019, losing 155 points because of fears of a global slowdown.\u00a0The TSX remains up 12 per cent on the year.\nWeak manufacturing data from Europe and the United States had investors nervous, coming on top of the Fed's guidance that it may not raise rates again this year.

And the numbers for both banks suggest they have growing worries about the loans on their books.\nRoyal Bank reported adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share, well below the $1.58 that analysts were expecting. All told, Royal made a profit of more than $1.4 billion last quarter. But that's a drop of 54 per cent from what the bank made in the same stretch in 2019.\nA big reason for the profit plunge is a spike in loan loss provisions. That's the amount that banks set aside to cover bad loans. Royal hiked its provisions to $2.8 billion in the quarter, a huge jump from $426 million last year.\nAlmost all parts of Royal's business units saw profits plunge, but most of the damage came in the core personal and commercial banking units, the capital markets division, and wealth management.\nOn the other side of the ledger, Royal's\u00a0 investor and\u00a0treasury services division saw profit rise by 50 per cent to $226 million. And profits in the insurance division rose by 17 per cent to $180 million.\nNot all of those $2.8 billion worth of loans will necessarily default. But Royal is setting aside that much money to cover potential losses that aren't currently being paid back the way they are supposed to be.\nIt was a similar story at BMO, which posted adjusted profit of $1.04 per share. Like Royal, BMO's profit was lower\u00a0than the $1.22 analysts were expecting.\u00a0\nAll in all, BMO earned $689 million in the quarter, well down from the $1.5 billion last year.\nAnd Bank of Montreal saw the same trend in loan loss provisions, with its figure rising from $176 million last year to $1.11 billion this quarter.\nNo part of the bank's operations were immune to the damage of COVID-19, as BMO said its personal and commercial banking division in the U.S. and Canada saw smaller profits, as did wealth management. The capital markets unit swung to a loss after being profitable last year.\nBoth banks maintained their dividends, despite the profit slump. Royal will pay a dividend of $1.08 a share, and BMO will pay $1.06 a share.\nWhile the soaring loan losses were concerning, investors seemed in a mood to focus on the positives on Wednesday, as shares in both banks rose on the TSX on Wednesday even as the S&P/TSX Composite Index fell slightly.\nRoyal Bank shares were trading at just over $90 apiece nearing midday, up almost three per cent on the day. BMO shares, meanwhile were just below $71 each, up about one per cent.\nAnalyst John Aiken at Barclays offered one explanation for the optimism, saying in a note to clients on Wednesday that the bad times may have hit bottom. \"While we believe that [Royal's] conservatism will allow for better earnings going forward, we are concerned that the earnings comparison to peers this quarter will weigh on its valuation.\"\nAs credit downgrades and drawdowns on credit facilities increased, Royal Bank saw a 30-basis-point decline in its common equity Tier 1, the measure of a bank's capital strength, to 11.7 per cent\u00a0of risk-weighted assets from the earlier quarter. BMO's ratio fell to 11 per cent\u00a0from 11.4 per cent.\nLegally, chartered Canadian banks have to keep those ratios above nine per cent. Otherwise they are obligated to raise more money to keep in their reserves.\nTwo other banks, Scotiabank and National Bank, reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that painted a similar picture to the one Royal and BMO\u00a0painted \u2014 lower profits and much higher loan loss provisions.\nCanada's two other big banks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion, will post their numbers in the coming days.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oil prices tumble, TSX retreats", "description": "U.S. oil production rose last week", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-dollar-stocks-markets-1.4099886", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4100030.1493928763!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 04, 2017 4:45 PM ET", "2017-05-04T21:54:39.516Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Oil prices slumped on Thursday amid ongoing concerns over a global supply glut.\nThe price for West Texas Intermediate hit\u00a0a five-month low, with the June futures contract losing $2.30 US to end the day at $45.52.\n\nBrent crude was off almost five per cent at $48.40 US, after going as low as $48.16 US.\nDuring the day, both WTI and Brent hit lows not seen since OPEC agreed\u00a0to cut production back on Nov. 30.\nData released this week by the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. crude output rose by 28,000 barrels a day last week.\u00a0\nU.S. output has been on the rise in recent months, touching production levels not seen since August 2015, according to Bloomberg.\nU.S. crude inventories\u00a0fell 930,000 barrels for the week to April 28, but analysts had been expecting a drop of 2.3 million barrels.\u00a0U.S. crude stocks stood at 527.8 million barrels, only 7 million barrels from a record high.\nReuters reported that prices fell Thursday on indications that OPEC and other producing countries wouldn't take additional big steps to cut production.

But whether it's able to get over regulatory hurdles is another question.\n\"It would look very bad on Maple to renege or alter their offer at this point, so I suspect they will\u00a0come together with\u00a0TMX on\u00a0a deal,\" said Ian Nakamoto, director of research at investment firms MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier in Toronto. \"But a lot of work will have to be done to get past some of the monopolistic and economic nationalism concerns that have been raised.\"\nBecause it's a Canadian takeover, Maple's bid would not necessarily require a government review under the Investment Canada Act's \"net benefit\" test of any deals over $299 million.\nBut regulators in five provinces and Canada's Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken must be satisfied before any deal could go through.\nThe NDP was calling earlier\u00a0on Wednesday for public consultations on the TMX/LSE merger. After the LSE deal fell apart in the afternoon, the NDP's Industry critic, Peter Julian, said he wasn't surprised by the shareholders' rejection.\n\"I think this was not in the national interest, very clearly. Some shareholders probably responded in that way,\" he said.\nThe federal government still needs to create a public and transparent process to review future takeovers or mergers that includes consultations, Julian said.\nTMX shares were halted in Toronto just prior to the news at 1 p.m. When trading resumed roughly 30 minutes later, TSX shares were 2.5 per cent higher to $44.50. LSE shares were also more than 1.5 per cent higher in London after news of the deal's death broke.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Markets continue rebound from post-Brexit shock", "description": "Benchmark Toronto stock index regains almost 347 points in two days", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stocks-market-brexit-rebound-1.3657732", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3658003.1467216671!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/aptopix-financial-markets-wall-street.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jun 29, 2016 10:47 AM ET", "2016-06-29T21:53:40.167Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Stock markets continued to rally from their post-Brexit losses as they posted a second straight days of gains.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P/TSX composite index rose by 194.05\u00a0points to finish at 14,036.74.\nTwelve of the 13 subgroups closed higher, led by metals and\u00a0mining at 577.09 points, up 22.50 points, or 4.06 per cent.\u00a0Consumer staples was the only decliner, losing 0.13 of a point,\u00a0or 0.03 per cent, to 501.39 points.\n\nAfter the shock of the result of the\u00a0Brexit\u00a0vote knocked more than 441 points off the S&P/TSX composite, the\u00a0subsequent two-day rebound\u00a0has returned almost 347 points.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 284 points, or 1.6 per\u00a0cent, to 17,694, while the broader S&P 500 index\u00a0gained 34 points, or 1.7 per\u00a0cent, to 2,070.\u00a0The Nasdaq composite index climbed 87 points, or 1.9 per cent, to\u00a04,779.\nU.S. bank stocks, which had been pounded following the Brexit vote, led the market on Wednesday, with Citigroup posting a gain of 4\u00a0per cent.\nFollowing last Thursday's referendum that saw a majority of British voters say they wanted out of the European Union, the devastating market reaction wiped out an estimated $3 trillion US in two days.\nIn the U.K., the FTSE\u00a0100 closed Wednesday\u00a0at 6,360.06,\u00a0up 219.67 points from its previous finish.\u00a0Germany's DAX gained\u00a01.7 per cent, while France's CAC 40 added 2.6 per cent.\nThe Canadian dollar added 0.35\u00a0of a cent to reach 77.07\u00a0cents US.

I owe 150 just to the pharmacy,\" Gevelidis said.\nThe capital controls are meant to staunch the flow of money out of Greek banks and spur the country's creditors to offer concessions before Greece's international bailout program expires Tuesday.\nWithout a deal to extend the bailout program, Greece will lose access to the remaining 7.2 billion euros ($9.93 billion Cnd) of rescue loans, and is unlikely to be able to meet a 1.6 billion-euro ($2.21 billion Cdn) debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund due the same day.\nMuch of the problem from the international community stems from the fact that there is a lot of Greek debt on the books of foreign nations and foreign banks.\nOf the nearly $46.8 billion owed abroad by borrowers in Greece, German banks hold $13.3 billion, U.S. banks $12.7 billion and British banks $12.2 billion, data compiled by the Bank for International Settlements showed.\nThe accelerating crisis has thrown into question Greece's financial future and continued membership in the 19-nation shared euro currency \u2014 and even the 28-country European Union.\nMark Grant, managing director at U.S. money manager Southwest Securities, said the situation couldn't be any more dire.\n\"What we are facing, in my opinion, is the 'Eurozone Moment'\u00a0which may turn out to be the 'Lehman Moment'\u00a0squared,\" he said, referring to the 2008 collapse of U.S. bank Lehman Brothers, the failure of which started the last great global recession.\nOthers are more confident.\nTD Bank economist Andrew Labelle said \"Greece will almost certainly not pay the 1.5 billion euros\u00a0it owes the IMF on June 30th\u00a0[but]\u00a0In reality, this will have no immediate impact.\"\nGreece also owes fairly sizable salaries and pension payments on Tuesday, Labelle says, but the country\u00a0is believed to have enough funds for these payments. \"In the case of non-payment, domestic unrest may increase,\" he said.\nInvestors around the world are worried that should Greece leave the euro and say it can't pay its debts, the global economic recovery could be derailed and questions would grow over the long-term viability of the euro currency itself.\n\"The images of queues at ATMs in Greece are stripping traders of what little confidence they have left in the nation, and the financial earthquake that happened in the eurozone over the weekend can be felt around the world,\" said David Madden, market analyst at IG.\n\nAside from developments at the banks in Greece, massive queues formed at gas stations, with worried motorists seeking to fill up their tanks and pay with credit cards while they were still being accepted.\nAlthough credit and cash card transactions have not been restricted, many retailers were not accepting card transactions Monday morning.\nElectronic transfers and bill payments are allowed, but only within the country. The government also stressed the controls would not affect foreign tourists, who would have no limits on cash withdrawals with foreign bank cards.\nRatings agency S&P deems the country's debt as\u00a0CCC-negative. That's one of the lowest levels on the scale, after being downgraded to\u00a0CCC-positive\u00a0earlier this month. In April, Greece was rated BBB-negative, still in \"junk\" status\n\n\n\n"}, {"author": "David Hodges", "title": "TSX poised to eke out gains in 2018, despite uncertainty over NAFTA and oil", "description": "Canadian stock performance tends to depend on the commodity cycle, which is in a relative lull right now", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-2018-1.4469301", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2864362.1418056952!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-stock-stock-market-stocks-markets-investing.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 01, 2018 12:45 PM ET", "2018-01-01T17:45:14.083Z"], "source": null, "content": "While stabilizing oil prices helped Canadian equities break out of their doldrums in the second half of 2017, investors expecting the Toronto Stock Exchange to catch up with its outperforming global peers in the new year should instead anticipate more modest returns with the add-on of greater market volatility.\n\"Despite being flat in the early part of the year and then posting some gains here in the back half of the year, the swings in equity prices on the S&P/TSX composite index have been incredibly small by historical standards,\" said Craig Fehr, a Canadian markets strategist with Edward Jones. \"And so I think the first thing we can expect from the TSX is much bigger swings in prices, much more volatility on a daily and weekly basis.\"\n\"All that said, I think there's still more gas left in the tank for this bull market,\" he added, referencing the eight-plus years of global gains since the dark days of 2009 in the wake of the last recession.\n\"I think we can see positive returns again in 2018. I would expect them to be relatively muted so ... Canadian equities, domestic equities, still underperform international markets.\"\nAfter hitting a record high of 15,922.67 on Feb. 21, the TSX steadily declined to a low of 14,951.88 by Aug. 21, down 2.2 per cent on the year at the time. A resurgence in oil \u2014 which saw crude prices rally from a 2017 low of $42.53 US per barrel on June 21 to a barrier-breaking high of $60.42 US on the final trading day of the year \u2014 sparked a surge in energy shares that saw the TSX complete its first of many record closes in the latter half of 2017.\nBy Dec. 27 and Dec. 28, the TSX closed at consecutive record highs of 16,203.13 and 16,221.95, respectively. It finished 2017 at 16,209.13, ahead 921.54 points or about six per cent on the year.\nBy comparison, Wall Street's S&P 500 index \u2014 the American equivalent to the TSX \u2014 gained 434.78 points or about 19 per cent in 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average added 4,956.62 points or about 25 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 1,520.27 points or about 28 per cent.\nOne the most dominant themes in equity markets in 2017 was the trend toward stability from cyclicality in an otherwise uncertain political and geopolitical backdrop, said Candice Bangsund, vice-president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital.\nThis saw the more defensive U.S. equity markets, which are heavily weighted towards technological growth, thrive last year. Meanwhile, the cyclically-based Canadian equity markets made up primarily of financial, energy and materials sectors were largely underappreciated.\nWhile oil is a key influence on the commodity-heavy TSX, economist Todd Mattina of Mackenzie Investments said he expects it to remain range-bound around its current level of $50 US to $60 US a barrel going into the new year \u2014 a level that will not really help the index in a meaningful way.\n\"The TSX has benefited in recent months because of the strong rally in oil prices. But there's a number of uncertainties going into 2018 that also cloud the outlook,\" he said. \"One of them is how much further can oil prices rally? ... To the extent that higher oil prices since September have supported gains in the TSX, a risk factor in 2018 is that oil prices could run into resistance if U.S. shale producers increase production at today's higher price levels.\"\nStill, oil only touches upon one of several possible risks for the TSX in 2018, Mattina added. \"The oil price outlook is not the driver of our bearish view of Canadian stocks. We are underweight the Canadian stock market because valuations are not highly attractive relative to other major stock markets and our indicators of investor sentiment look bearish.\"\nHe said that in addition to the policy uncertainty around ongoing NAFTA renegotiations, another factor weighing on the TSX is the perennial concern about very high levels of Canadian household debt and how that will affect consumer spending in the forthcoming years.\nStatistics Canada reported in December that household credit market debt as a proportion of household disposable income increased to 171.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, up from 170.1 per cent in the second quarter. That means there was $1.71 in credit market debt, which includes consumer credit and mortgage and non-mortgage loans, for every dollar of household disposable income.\nWhile consumers were the dominant engine behind growth last year amid solid employment gains, Bangsund said she expects trade and business development to take the baton in 2018 as earlier fears of a U.S. and global economic slowdown have proven unfounded in 2017. That could see the cyclical segments of the market that favour Canadian equities regain leadership performance.\n\"The TSX will be the main beneficiary if that scenario of stronger growth and rising commodity prices does continue into 2018 due to that cyclicality of the Canadian stock market,\" she said.\nA 2018 global market outlook report by Russell Investments Canada Ltd. also supports higher Canadian equity prices due to late-cycle tailwinds while still cautioning that it also expects volatility to be higher over 2018 versus 2017 as markets start to consider the timing of the next recession. Given this uncertainty around the domestic equities, the Russell report concluded it's \"modestly positive on Canadian equities with a price target of 16,900 for year-end 2018 for the S&P/TSX composite index.\"\nShould Canadian equity returns in 2018 mirror those of the prior 12 months, Fehr said investors should keep in mind that while that doesn't stack up well against the juggernaut momentum seen in other global markets, they are still relatively healthy gains.\n\"For the Canadian market by historical standards it's certainly solid,\" he said. \"It's underperformance but it's positive performance, so it's not terrible.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Mercer International to give up TSX listing following loss at NAFTA tribunal", "description": "The U.S.-based forest products company had mounted a $250-million claim against the Canadian government", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mercer-international-tsx-nafta-1.4678795", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3438462.1454945652!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dollar-markets-20160111.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 25, 2018 4:41 PM ET", "2018-05-25T20:41:08.586Z"], "source": null, "content": "Mercer International says it intends to voluntarily de-list from the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 11, about three months after it lost a six-year-old NAFTA battle with the Canadian government.\nThe U.S.-based forest products company had mounted a $250-million claim against the Canadian government in early 2012.\nIt alleged that BC Hydro and the B.C.

of\u00a0its value or about $700 billion, and investors should be prepared to ride out further troubles in the new year as the wounds continue to fester.\nThe energy, mining and financial services stocks that make up most of the TSX composite index saw their values eroded badly as the recession weakened demand for oil and minerals and the Wall Street financial crisis squeezed the banks.\nCanada's main stock market ended the year on an upswing in the final day of trading for 2008, rising nearly 157 points, but that will be of little comfort to many stock investors.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange S&P/TSX composite index closed at 8,987.7 on Wednesday; it ended 2007 at 13,833.06.\n\"I'm glad to see the last trading day of this lousy year,\" said Fred Ketchen, manager of equity trading at Scotia Capital.\nOverall, it was a year that saw both a record high and the worst declines on record at the TSX.\nIn June, the main stock market had record closing highs just above 15,000, as energy prices soared and overall optimism prevailed.\nThen the summer ended, and with it went the sky-high oil prices and investor confidence as U.S. investment bank Lehman Bros. failed, and other pillars of Wall Street wobbled and threatened to crash.\n\nCredit suddenly became more sparse than it had been at any time in recent memory, making it more expensive and difficult for banks and other major lenders to finance business projects and consumer buying.\n\nWhat initially seemed like a somewhat isolated problem quickly spread to all of the key sectors, including the auto industry, which was already battling a sales slowdown, and to energy companies embarked on costly development projects that hinged on a high oil price .\nThe impacts were being felt everywhere, even on the consumer staples, which are typically considered relatively safe during recessions.\nBut consumer staples was also that sector that endured one of the softest drops on the TSX, down roughly 12 per cent on the year.\n\"Indeed they showed their defensive qualities this year, although because there was no hiding place they went down less than the market as a whole,\" Gavin Graham, vice-president with BMO Asset Management, said\u00a0of consumer staples.\n\"It's things that everybody needs and will continue to buy like food, beverages and medication.\"\u00a0\nEconomists are split over when the stock markets will start to make a recovery from their recent dismal levels.\nGraham is optimistic that 2009 will signal better times for Canada.\n\"After you've had a year as bad as this one, you've always seen a fairly substantial, double-digit positive return from the markets the following year,\" he said.\nHowever, several major factors are still up in the air, including the short-term direction of oil prices.\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which accounts for about 40 per cent of global supply, has been slashing oil production in an effort to reduce supplies and,\u00a0it hopes, boost crude prices.\nFurther production cuts could be discussed if OPEC meets in Kuwait City on Jan. 19, and that could send prices higher which would likely give Canadian energy companies a boost on the market.\nAlso teetering on unstable ground is domestic consumer confidence, which is in danger of toppling the retail sector.\nThe Conference Board of Canada says that consumer confidence in December was at its lowest level since 1981-82, during the worst post-war recession.\nThe weakening results are especially alarming because economists say that Canadians are responding to a deepening recession in the United States, which means that they're cutting spending in preparation for a stormy economic climate that doesn't necessarily exist within the country.\nTighter spending could inevitably bring some of the U.S. retail sector's woes\u00a0to Canada in the coming quarters.\nGraham suggests that cautious investors should consider buying stocks in companies that still pay dividends, such as natural gas pipeline operators TransCanada Corp. and Enbridge Income Fund.\n\"If you're feeling a little more adventurous, you could even try some of the banks and life insurance companies like Royal Bank, Scotiabank or TD Bank,\" he said.\nThe financial sector has been slammed with writedowns related to the credit crisis for more than a year, but some investors have championed the banks nonetheless, saying that traditionally banks will see surefire profit growth over the long term.\nMost of the banks have also remained steadfast on their dividend payments, with some choosing to raise capital rather than slash dividends.\nKetchen said there are still significant opportunities on the market in 2009, as long as investors are patient and don't concentrate on one sector.\n\"Our opinion is that as you move through the latter part of 2009, things will look a whole lot more interesting than where they are now,\"\u00a0\u00a0he said.\nHe suggested that investors set up a tax-free savings account, a government plan that allows Canadians aged 18 or older to set up an account where they can invest up to $5,000 each year and allow it to grow tax-free.\nInvestors can use the account to save money through guaranteed investment certificates, bonds, mutual funds and stocks.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX, loonie flat on Remembrance

Much of the growth was encouraged by Day who took an active role in building the company with a grassroots marketing campaign that rallied customers with in-store yoga classes and other community events.\nHowever, a number of stumbles in quality control have raised questions about whether she would be the right person to lead a global expansion of the company into China and Europe.\nDay, who will remain as CEO while the board searches for a replacement, provided little explanation for her departure.\nLululemon is still struggling to overcome the recall earlier this year that saw the company yank about 17 per cent of its black Luon yoga pants from store shelves for being too sheer.\nThe company blamed the problem on a style change and production problems and hired a new team to oversee the making of the pants. Around the same time, chief product officer Sheree Waterson departed the company though specific reasons for Waterson's departure were not disclosed.\nDay, who joined Lululemon in 2008 shortly after its initial public offering, said she told Lululemon's board of her plans to leave on Friday and a search committee was put in place over the weekend, which would be a relatively quick decision for a major shift in leadership. The move raises many questions about the future direction of the retailer.\n\"We expect it to take some time to fill the all-important roles with the right people,\" wrote Morris in a note.\n\"Moreover, it takes time for new teams to gel.\"\nMorris said the company is likely to endure more turmoil as works on the quality control issues, launches a new distribution channel structure and related IT systems, and prepares to expand to new countries.\n\"We continue to believe the company faces quality-control issues outside of the black Luon pants, based on our consumer research,\" he added.\nFaulty clothing has been a recurring problem for Lululemon which has grown at such a speedy pace over the past five years that it's had trouble keeping products stocked on its shelves. Those challenges have ramped up production, but also could be at the root of numerous complaints last year about colours bleeding from some of its tops and see-through bathing suits and pants.\nLululemon can't afford to fumble its international rollout into more fickle markets like Hong Kong and much of Europe, which favour clothing that's more formal over stretchy yoga pants.\nJaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, suggested Lululemon could look to other major sportwear companies like Under Armour or Nike for executive expertise that would serve the company well in the coming years.\n\"If you can pick and choose people from some of the competitive firms that have gone through these growing pains in the past you can maybe prevent some of the mishaps that just kind of tend to occur as a business grows,\" Katz said.\nThe transition comes as the retailer, which reports in U.S. dollars, posted a first-quarter profit of $47.3 million or 32 cents per share.\nThe results came in above analyst expectations of 29 cents per share, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters, but marked only a slight increase in profits from a year ago when it earned $47 million, also 32 cents per share.\nRevenue strengthened 21 per cent to $345.8 million US\u00a0from $285.7 million US.\nThe company also boosted its full-year outlook, with expectations of earnings per share of $1.96 to $2.01, an increase from $1.95 to $1.99. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion, an increase from $1.615 billion to $1.640 billion.\nLululemon will delist from the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 24 due to \"minimal trading volume of its shares.\" Lululemon is also listed on the Nasdaq market.\nLululemon shares\u00a0were down $14.81, or 17.6 per cent, at $69.22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and to $67.85 US\u00a0on Nasdaq, which handles most of the stock's trading volume.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Marijuana company Aphria met with TSX about guidance regarding U.S. business", "description": "TMX Group has warned companies U.S. federal pot laws will take precedence over state rules", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/aphria-tsx-1.4367506", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4316935.1507168034!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/alaska-marijuana.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 23, 2017 1:24 PM ET", "2017-10-23T17:24:31.730Z"], "source": null, "content": "Marijuana producer Aphria Inc. says it met with the Toronto Stock Exchange last week to discuss the exchange's recent guidance that pot firms with U.S. exposure could face delisting.\nAphria chief executive Vic Neufeld says the company reiterated its commitment to work collaboratively with the TSX as it continues to monitor developments in this sector.\nHe noted that Aphria has not received notice from the TSX of a continued listing review.\nAphria has investments in Florida and Arizona.\nThe TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, warned companies earlier this month that U.S. federal marijuana laws takes precedence over state laws.\nIt said that companies doing business that violates the federal law are not complying with their listing requirements.\nLast week, Neufeld said he wanted to remain listed on the TSX and had no plans to move to the smaller marijuana stock-friendly Canadian Securities Exchange.\nNeufeld has said that if the company cannot reach a compromise, there are options, including a spin-off of its U.S. activities to be listed on the CSE.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Maple Group's TSX buyout wins shareholder approval", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/maple-group-s-tsx-buyout-wins-shareholder-approval-1.1290797", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1553757.1381644039!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-tmx852.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 31, 2012 9:02 PM ET", "2012-08-01T03:43:17.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A\u00a0consortium of Canadian banks and investment funds has succeeded in its bid to\u00a0acquire\u00a0the country's\u00a0largest stock exchange.\nMaple Group Acquisition Corp. has had 91 per cent of the\u00a0equity of TMX Group Inc., the parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange, tendered to its takeover offer.\nThe offer\u00a0needed shareholders representing at least 70 per cent of\u00a0the stock to agree to sell their stakes by\u00a0Tuesday's deadline.

Intraday trading volatility\u00a0is higher than ever\u00a0\u2014 some estimates say as much as a third of the trades on the TSX and more than half on the NYSE are high-frequency traders, on any given day.\n\"Somebody is causing that volatility and somebody is taking advantage of it,\" Schmitt said.\nRBC was not part of the consortium of financiers that formed Maple Group two years ago, as an alternative to a proposed merger with the London Stock Exchange that was on the table at the time.\nSchmitt said the investors backing the plan have given the idea a strong vote of confidence, but it shouldn't be interpreted that trading on the TSX and\u00a0Aequitas would be an either/or proposition.\n\"We want to provide services for all types of companies and investors,\" he said. \"And we want to make sure we grow the pie.\"\nSchmitt also said Aequitas will stop well short of banning\u00a0high-frequency trading\u00a0outright, just that they're going to limit some of the more deleterious sides of the practice, such as\u00a0latency arbitrage, rebate arbitrage and exploratory trading.\n(Latency arbitrage refers to unfair trading based on one trader having access to information before another, rebate arbitrage is when exchanges give discounted trading costs to certain traders, and exploratory trading refers to the behaviour described above, where buy and sell orders are placed and then cancelled solely in order to gauge and manipulate prices.)\n\"We're saying, 'Come and trade here because it's an environment that's protected,'\" Schmitt said. \"We're creating a microcosm where good trading activity takes place.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether Aequitas truly levels the playing field for small investors\u00a0\u2014 much less brings down costs\u00a0\u2014 but the new exchange will make it easier for investors to buy into private share and unlisted companies, two asset classes that are currently out of reach for most retail investors.\n\"As marketplaces cater to volume, they can damage the quality of execution for those who actually want to hold something at the end of the day,\" said Scott Penman, IGM's chief investment officer and vice-chair of the new company.\nIGM and CI together own more than $125 billion worth of Canadian equities, heft that will certainly provide the new exchange with enough trading activity in the short term.\nIndeed, the presence of major mutual fund firms\u00a0\u2014 who are collectively known as being on the \"buy side\" of the industry\u00a0because their core business is buying securities\u00a0\u2014 makes Aequitas different from other TSX alternatives that have come before. Such as Alpha Trading Systems, a rival trading platform that made inroads before being dissolved when Maple Group\u00a0gained control of the TSX last fall.\n\"Alpha was backed by the banks [and] big dealers, Aequitas is backed by the buy side,\" University of Toronto economics professor Andreas Park said in an interview.\u00a0\"That tells you something about buy-side needs [and] interests.\"\nAequitas's founders expect the exchange to be operational by the end of 2014, pending regulatory approval.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian retailer Roots files for IPO, plans to

It is highlighting that it is slow growing but at least it is expanding,\" Del Greco said.\nEarlier, the Commerce Department reported that people spent less money at gas stations, department stores and electronics retailers last month. The result was a surprise to analysts, who expected retail sales to grow.\nThe Labor Department also said consumer prices slipped, mostly thanks to lower energy prices. That showed how little inflation there has been in the economy, a continued concern for the Fed.\nIn commodities, the August gold contract was up $7.30 to $1,275.90 US an ounce.

The yield the 10-year treasury bonds\u00a0hit a record low, falling to 1.77 per cent from 1.86 late Wednesday. Yields fall when demand for treasury bonds rises.\nInvestors were also discouraged by rating agency Moody's downgrade yesterday\u00a0of U.S. banks Bank of America, Citibank and Wells Fargo. Another ratings firm, Standard & Poor's, also\u00a0downgraded seven Italian banks due to sovereign debt risk yesterday.\nData from China didn't help.

The Fed has raised rates, which sits at a still-low range of one per cent to 1.25 per cent, three times in the past six months.\nElsewhere in commodities, the August natural gas contract dipped 11 cents at $2.84 per mmBTU and the September copper contract fell three cents at $2.66 a pound.

But in recent years, alternative trading systems such as Omega, MATCH Now, Pure Trading, Instinet, Chi-X and most recently Alpha Group have eaten into the TSX's dominance.\nAfter holding a virtual monopoly, only 64 per cent of stock transactions in Canada happened over TSX's systems last month.\nAs a result, the\u00a0world's major stock\u00a0exchanges have looked to each other for mergers in an attempt to maintain their dominance. A report in the Financial Times on Wednesday suggested that shares in\u00a0the New York Stock Exchange\u00a0and Germany's Deutsche Borse have been suspended as the NYSE was in advanced stages of discussions to take over its German rival.\nThe New York Stock Exchange merged with Euronext in a complex transaction in 2006. At that time, the Nasdaq attempted to purchase the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and there is speculation that the NYSE might still have an interest in acquiring the TSX.\nUnder the terms of the current agreement, TMX shareholders would receive 2.9963 LSEG ordinary shares for each TMX share.

Three are pharmaceutical companies based outside of Canada. U.S. fertilizer giant Scotts Miracle-Gro is also in the fund.\nThe passive exchange traded fund tracks most of the companies listed in the\u00a0North American Medical Marijuana Index compiled by German indexing firm\u00a0Solactive.

A lot of it is based on the expectations of future growth.\"\nThose growth\u00a0expectations are largely predicated upon the eventual legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada, which could come as early as July 2018.\nWhen recreational legalization happens, said Hawkins, some of the stocks in the Horizons ETF are poised to benefit. Many of the legal medical marijuana producers in Canada are building up capacity to sell into the recreational market once they can.\n\"The index and the ETF itself will dynamically change as the regulations that govern this industry change,\" Hawkins said.\nHorizons Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF opened at\u00a0$10.11 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, and was trading at $10.24 as of noon ET.\n\"What's good about an ETF like this is, it does get you a lot of the pure pot stocks, which can be very risky and volatile,\" said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\"What the ETF serves up is a way to dampen that single stock risk,\" said Balchunas. \"So instead of an investor saying, 'Hey, let me try to pick out one of these pot stocks that should benefit from the overall legalization and recreational use of pot,' now you get [a number of] stocks in a basket.\n\"And so if one of them blows up, the ETF doesn't really feel it that much. It's like a little dent, as opposed to all your money gone.\"\nThat said, Balchunas warned that even diversified investments in the marijuana industry are still considered quite risky.\n\"I would say this is your classic speculation kind of investment \u2014 high risk, high reward,\" he said. \"Not necessarily something that you'd bank on sending your kids to college with.\"\nThe funds's management fee of 0.75 per cent is \"a little higher than the average ETF,\" said Balchunas, adding that such a premium price is to be expected in a hot-topic investment product.\nBalchunas said he's received lots of inquiries about marijuana exchange traded funds from\u00a0investors over the past year.\n\"Because even regular people are looking at this industry, and they want to know how to participate.

We have emails, but you can't use them or we will be identified....These complacent officers are paid a fortune and many have made millions on their shares based largely on crooked Libyan deals, and are responsible for making people like me and my friends culpable in a criminal enterprise, just by our silence.'\n\n\"We believe that the payment of a financial incentive is the most critical [factor] to the success of the program,\" the OSC\u00a0proposal says.\nAlthough the goal is to\u00a0better protect whistleblowers'\u00a0identities,\u00a0Ontario's regulator might not be able to guarantee full anonymity once a case reaches court.

Bona fide tipsters would be eligible to receive up to 15 per cent of any settlements in excess of $1 million, to a maximum of $1.5 million per whistleblower.\n\nIt's also unclear whether whistleblowers who are themselves mired in the illegal activity would be eligible for payouts. \u00a0\n\n\"The argument in favour of allowing culpable whistleblowers to receive an award is that it may lead to high quality information being received,\" states the OSC proposal. \"However, [that] may send an inappropriate message to the market and may harm the overall integrity of the whistleblower\u00a0program.\"\n\nTransparency International Canada's Paul Lalonde\u00a0says while better whistleblower protection\u00a0is vital, he cautions that\u00a0large\u00a0bounties can ironically\u00a0undermine internal whistleblower programs and ethical\u00a0corporate culture.\n\"I think to some degree [payoffs to tipsters] undermine efforts by companies to promote internal compliance whistleblowing,\" Lalonde said. \u00a0\"Whistleblower bounties can cross a line and actually create perverse incentives for people to be in cahoots with the bad behaviour and then if they feel the temperature rising a bit, to then cash in on the bounty.\"\n\nIn the U.S., the largest whistleblower award ever paid out was by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which paid $104 million to a former American banker at UBS. \u00a0Bradley Birkenfeld reported the Swiss bank for engaging in massive fraud and tax evasion.

Birkenfeld tried to negotiate immunity for himself but ultimately wound up serving two and a half years in prison for his role. \u00a0\nAfter his release from prison in 2012 the IRS, citing his \"exceptional co-operation\" and the \"breadth and depth\" of his information, lived up to its whistleblower policy and paid Birkenfeld 25 per cent\u00a0of the roughly $400 million recouped in the probe.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S.set up a whistleblower program under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Law Act\u00a0that resulted in more than\u00a03,000 tips last year alone to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \u00a0\nOne of the tipsters, an unnamed foreign citizen, was paid more than $30 million for information that led to a successful prosecution. \u00a0The SEC said it \"hopes that awards like this one will incentivize company and industry insiders, or others who may have knowledge of possible federal securities law violations, both in the U.S. and abroad, to come forward and report their information promptly to the commission.\"\u200b\n\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency began an offshore tax informant program\u00a0in January 2014, offering up to 15 per cent of funds recovered in cases that see the CRA recoup more than $100,000. \u00a0To date, the program has received 2,000 calls, leading to\u00a0100 tipsters being considered for eligibility with a number entering into formal contracts with the\u00a0agency. \u00a0But because the program is so new,\u00a0there has yet to be a single financial payment to anyone informing on a tax cheat.\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Ottawa-based Mitel Networks Corp. lists on the TSX", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-based-mitel-networks-corp-lists-on-the-tsx-1.1216988", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jun 27, 2012 11:36 AM ET", "2012-06-27T17:26:01.000Z"], "source": null, "content": "Mitel Networks Corp.

roller-coaster, stomach-churning clich\u00e9s are pretty apt descriptions for the world faced by many North American investors during the past year.\nFrom a pre-recession high of 13,750 (Aug. 28, 2008), Canada's benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index\u00a0plunged 45 per cent to 7,566 (March 9, 2009), as North America's stock markets mirrored the crashing global economy.\nSince the market woes of March, the TSX has gained more than 40 per cent, reaching 10,654 points on Aug. 19.\nMany investors, however, may not be all that interested in trying to tame the equity serpent to repair their portfolios this time around, experts say.\nInstead, stock buyers look ready to return to the investment strategy of their parents\u00a0\u2014 buy and hold stable companies and bank those quarterly dividends.\n\"People will be looking for income, and I think a dividend is something they will want,\" said Peter Drake, vice-president retirement and economic research at Fidelity Investments Canada, a large investment company.\nAnd a lot of firms have already noticed the subtle shift.\u00a0 In the past few months, a number of publicly traded companies have taken to issuing dividends after a hiatus or boosting their existing payouts.\nIn February, Rogers Communications Inc., the national TV\u00a0cable and wireless\u00a0company, hiked its annual dividend to $1.16 a share, up from the previous $1.00.\nSo did restaurant chain Tim Hortons Inc., pushing up its\u00a0quarterly per-share payout to a dime from nine cents in the same month.\nIn August, Home Capital Group Inc., a Toronto-based trust company, hiked its quarterly dividend to 15 cents, a penny rise from the previous period.\u00a0\nIn that month, BPO Properties Ltd., whose holdings include First Canadian Place in Toronto and Bankers Hall in Calgary,\u00a0doubled its investor payment to 30 cents a quarter.\nAlso, BCE Inc. said it would boost its annual dividend by five per cent to get the payout to $1.62 a share.\nThe trend to higher dividends has not been a Canadian phenomenon alone, however.\nU.S. companies\u00a0\u2014 even financial institutions, which faced plunging stock prices and rising capital requirements in late 2008 and early 2009\u00a0\u2014 have raised their dividends.\nCincinnati Financial Corp., an investment company based in the Queen City, inched its regular quarterly dividend by half a cent to 39.5 cents US in August.\nGreensboro, N.C., cigarette-maker Lorillard Inc. boosts its three-month dividend to $1 US from 92 cents.\nIn addition, New York's John Wiley and Sons Inc. announced a penny hike in its quarterly dividend to 14 cents, the 16th year in a row in which the book publisher increased its shareholder payout.\nWhat used to be a small portion of a portfolio's total return\u00a0\u2014 the dividends paid by companies \u2014 has become more important, especially after the turmoil and capital losses investors endured over the past 12 months.\n\"Investors did lower their risk profiles since last fall,\" said Gareth Watson, director and senior equity adviser, ScotiaMcLeod's portfolio advisory group.\nBack in the halcyon days after 2002, people were not as interested in dividend-paying stocks, he said.\nInstead, investors were seeking the so-called \"big score,\" when a company's future profit potential could jet-propel its stock price now.\nBy contrast, companies that paid out dividends, such as large electrical-generation businesses and the bigger telecommunications providers, were seen as market laggards, corporations that paid out valuable cash to shareholders rather than investing the money in new ventures.\nLast year's global cash crunch, however, signaled the death of the long-running bull market in Canada and the United States.\nAs a result, potential capital stock gains quickly turned into real equity losses, as investors dumped most issues, even those players not facing liquidity issues.\nFast-forward a year and stock markets are recovering.\u00a0 This time, however, investors are focusing on how much cash companies pay out rather relying upon the promise of future growth, experts said.\nFor example, the Standard & Poor's Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which measures the performance of stocks that have increased their dividends over the past five years, has risen almost 50 per cent from its nadir in February.\nCanada's demographics favour these stocks, Fidelity's Drake said.\nStatistics Canada predicts that almost six million Canadians will be 65 years of age or older by 2016, up a million-and-a-half from 2006.\nOlder\u00a0investors tend to be more risk-adverse than younger Canadians and thus will be more interested in equity dividends and bond interest-rate coupons, Drake said.\nCorporate policy also has played into the recent popularity of dividend increases, stock watchers said.\nThat is because some companies want to maintain their payout as a specific percentage of their corporate profits. As firm earnings rise, so does the face value of the stock dividend.\nBPO Properties, for instance, doubled its dividend because the firm had $142 million in cash and near-cash on its books. In addition, the company also wants to maintain its dividend cash outflow as a set percentage of the balance statement, BPO said.\n\"(The increased dividend) reflects a payout ratio of approximately 60 per cent of our funds available for distribution, but more importantly is at a level we believe we can sustain through a real estate cycle,\" said Melissa Coley, BPO's vice-president of investor relations and communications.\nSuch a policy makes sense, said Scotiabank's Watson.\nAfter all, a corporation wants investors to have confidence that the company's dividend is predictable and sustainable, he said.\n\"So (once you declare a dividend), you are going to make sure you can back up that payment,\" Watson said.\nThere are some companies, mainly in the spending-heavy technology sector, that still hoard cash to reinvest in their operations.\nFor example, Research In Motion Ltd., the Waterloo, Ont.-based maker of the BlackBerry portable communications device, has not declared a dividend in the past three years.\nThe company has maintained this policy despite having almost $2 billion US in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of its current fiscal year.\nStill, to some extent, the dividend trend\u00a0is actually a return to normalcy after the ups and downs of the past few quarters in global stock markets.\nS&P estimated that, in 2007, payout cash comprised 6.7 per cent of per-capita American personal income. That was an increase from 4.8 per cent a decade earlier and a mere 2.8 per cent 20 years before.\n\"Paying dividends is not an extra,\" Watson said. \"Dividend policy is one of the main ways management uses to return value to shareholders.\"\nAnd, after a year in which investors have seen capital returns evaporate, that will likely be music to investors' ears.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/volatile-times-1.4521621", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news2/business/features/taxes/", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Canadian fashion retailer Reitmans granted creditor protection while restructuring its 576 stores", "description": "Chain also owns RW & CO., Thyme Maternity, Addition Elle, Penningtons stores", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/reitmans-restructuring-1.5575036", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5575817.1589918973!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-19-pandemic-reitmans.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 19, 2020 10:01 AM ET", "2020-05-19T20:39:54.505Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Women's fashion chain Reitmans has been granted protection from its creditors while it restructures, the latest retail victim of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Montreal-based company sought and was granted protection by a Quebec court under the\u00a0Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), a federal law governing companies that can't pay their bills.\n\"Filing for protection under the CCAA is truly the hardest decision we have had to make as an organization in our almost 100 years of history, but this pandemic has left us no choice,\" chief executive officer Stephen Reitman said. \"We believe that this is the only course of action to ensure we remain successful in the future.\"\nFounded in 1926, the TSX-listed company currently has\u00a0576 stores across Canada, including\u00a0259 Reitmans outlets, 106 Penningtons, 80 RW & CO. stores, 77 Addition Elle\u00a0stores and 54 Thyme Maternity locations. System-wide, the company has more than 6,800 employees.\nLike many other retailers, Reitmans has been hit hard by the\u00a0pandemic, as physical\u00a0distancing requirements forced the company to close its stores.\u00a0\nBut the company had financial problems before the current crisis. In its last fiscal\u00a0year, the company said\u00a0sales fell by $53.5 million, or 5.8 per cent from the previous year's level. And the company\u00a0lost money on those reduced sales, posting a net loss of $87.4 million for the year up to Feb\u00a01.\nThen COVID-19 came along and exacerbated the problems. In its last quarterly earnings release, the company made it clear that the pandemic was making it hard to pay the bills, even though it\u00a0continued selling online.\nIn early May,\u00a0Reitmans warned that unless it could secure short-term financing to pay the bills\u00a0\"it may be unable to continue as a going concern.\"\nRetail consultant Doug Stephens said\u00a0just as it does in humans, for retailers \"COVID-19 really\u00a0does seek\u00a0out pre-existing underlying problems,\" he said in an interview. \"And one of those is an over\u00a0reliance of physical stores for the distribution of your goods.\"\nReitmans was trying to address that problem before the pandemic, by shutting underperforming stores, particularly\u00a0in the plus-sized segment, through the Penningtons and Addition Elle\u00a0brands.\nRegardless of what happens in the restructuring,\u00a0the company plans to have\u00a0fewer physical stores in the future than it does today.\n\"As the restructuring gets underway, the company will look to optimize its retail footprint in\u00a0Canada\u00a0to emerge from this process in a stronger state,\" the chain said.\nThe chain has temporarily\u00a0laid off more than 90 per cent of its retail staff and almost a third of the employees at the company's Montreal head office. Any remaining staff are on a reduced salary.\nCourt filings suggest the company has\u00a0about $361 million worth of assets to its name, including $147 million worth of merchandise. That's\u00a0against a debt load of $109 million, $24 million owed to its pension plans, and millions of dollars in unpaid rent it owes to its landlords for April and May. The chain also says it has a liability of\u00a0\u00a0$14 million of unused gift cards out there, which the chain said\u00a0will be honoured if customers use them.\nThe company was worth more than $24 a share\u00a0in 2007, but the stock price\u00a0has fallen precipitously since then, losing 98 per cent of the\u00a0value in the past year alone.

The U.S. benchmark known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also fell to below $22\u00a0a barrel, a level it has not hit since 2003.\nThat was bad news for shares in oil companies, many of which\u00a0trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared almost as bad, closing\u00a0below the 20,000-point level.\nThe TSX was mostly dragged down by shares in oil companies, which were themselves responding to a plunge in the price of crude. Oil is being walloped by too much supply\u00a0in a time of reduced demand\u00a0because of the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic.\nAfter more than a year of an uneasy collaboration to limit supply and try to keep prices up,\u00a0Saudi Arabia and Russia started a price war\u00a0earlier this month, flooding the market with their cheap oil that\u00a0kicked\u00a0off\u00a0a race to the bottom in terms of oil prices.\nCanadian oilsands oil always trades at a discount to lighter blends, such as Brent and WTI, because it is more difficult to transport and process. So\u00a0the oversupply has hit the price of WCS\u00a0even more than other types of oil.\n\"Russia and Saudi Arabia are having this pissing match,\" said Canoe Financial portfolio manager Rafi Tahmazian in an interview with CBC News. \"And we're just living with it.\"\nThe two oil giants are essentially staring each other down, daring the other to blink.

Such measures may help the economy to withstand the impact of the coronavirus, but they will do very little to\u00a0put a bottom under the price of oil, which is subject to global forces outside of Canada's control.\n\"This virus is shutting down the world,\" Tahmazian said. \"Canada [has] a world of hurt ahead of it, and the U.S. has even more.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1703880259993", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Stock markets finish rough week with another dive into the red", "description": "TSX loses 3% as global stock sell-off continues for 6th day", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/friday-markets-1.5480540", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4604408.1522851005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 28, 2020 4:35 PM ET", "2020-02-28T21:37:14.858Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Toronto Stock Exchange lost 454 points on Friday after a technical glitch shut down trading early the day before \u2014 and investors picked up right where they left off by dumping shares in just about everything.\nCanada's largest stock exchange lost about three per cent of its value\u00a0as the fear over the coronavirus that has settled into financial markets this week continued to batter the share prices of Canadian companies.\nEvery sector was lower, from banks and\u00a0energy companies\u00a0to mining firms, health-care companies and IT.\u00a0\nOnly 17 companies listed on the S&P/TSX Composite Index made gains on Friday, while the other 214 lost ground.\nOil prices slumped again, with a barrel\u00a0of the North American crude benchmark known as West Texas Intermediate off $1.75\u00a0a barrel to barely above $45 US.

Investors flock toward things like bonds because they are perceived to be safer than other assets, as governments are unlikely to default on their loans.\nAll that bond buying pushes up their price, which counterintuitively drives their yields down \u2014 because governments don't have to offer a very good interest rate to find a willing buyer for their debt.\nAt one point on Monday morning, the yield on the Canadian government's 10-year bond dipped below 0.3 per cent, its lowest level on record. That means a buyer of that bond is effectively willing to\u00a0loan\u00a0the government $1,000 for an entire decade, and is only going to get $3 a year for their troubles. With inflation factored in, they're actually losing money.\u00a0But they are willing to accept that meagre return because it is preferable to other options where they think they'll do even worse.\nThe U.S. 10-year is telling a similar story, falling to a record low of 0.3228 per cent at one point on Monday morning\n\"The\u00a0lower it does go, the more people are likely to panic even further,\" said Rick Meckler, a partner with Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. \"The\u00a0more it goes down, the more people will be nervous about it.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Skittish over coronavirus, stock markets end fearful week with more losses", "description": "Dow sheds 600 points, TSX down close to 1 per cent", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-markets-dow-1.5448061", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5448063.1580502838!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Jan 31, 2020 3:35 PM ET", "2020-01-31T21:41:44.426Z"], "source": null, "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 600 points, or two per cent, on Friday as a virus outbreak that originated in China continued to widen, stoking stock investors' worries about the potential global economic fallout.\nThe broad sell-off erased gains for the month as a whole, which began with the market at record highs.

They used phone taps, undercover agents and an elaborate, fake contest to try to uncover more information about C\u00e9drika's homicide.\nIn Carrette's request yet to be filed, he says investigators had \"tunnel vision,\" were \"relentless\" and had a weak theory that his client was \"the only person who could have committed the alleged offences.\"\nBettez was arrested on child pornography charges on Aug. 29, 2016.\nFollowing his arrest, a S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Quebec investigator and polygraph examiner questioned him at provincial police headquarters in Montreal for 13 hours \u2014\u00a0until 4:30 a.m.\nAt the outset, the investigator warned him that the file of C\u00e9drika\u00a0would come up, even though Bettez had been arrested for possession, distribution and access to child pornography.\n\"I was asked to give you your rights for the case of C\u00e9drika Provencher, for the kidnapping of a minor and murder,\" the investigator said.\nCarette says police had no reasonable cause to link Bettez to C\u00e9drika\u00a0and were only zeroing in on him based on the type of vehicle he owned in 2007 and on his refusal to take a polygraph test.\nIn the days following C\u00e9drika's disappearance, police began searching for a 2004 red Acura TSX with tinted windows. Only six met the specific car description, and Bettez was the only one without an alibi.\nAccording to Carette's motion, the polygraph examiner \"strongly suggests, in a repeated fashion,\" that Bettez take a lie detector test.

That's what you have to understand, because you are under arrest,\" the polygraph examiner is quoted as saying in Carette's legal motion.\nThe document goes on to say that, \"the right to legal counsel requires police to not only give the person the opportunity to seek the immediate assistance of a lawyer, but also to stop interrogating or stop otherwise attempting to extract evidence.\"\nBettez consulted one lawyer before his interrogation.\nCarette's request also states that a video was shown to Bettez. It was recorded by a friend of his, trying to persuade him to agree to a lie detector test.\nBettez's interrogation ended more than 18 hours after his arrest.\n\"The investigators in charge of the file [of the disappearance of C\u00e9drika Provencher] planned a major operation to provoke a coup and proceeded to arrest Jonathan Bettez without a warrant,\" Carette\u00a0argues in the motion.\nIt goes on to elaborate that the law stipulates that an arrest can not be used for an investigation or to gather evidence.\nBettez, who was released on bail after being charged in 2016, is accused of\u00a0intent to distribute child pornography,\u00a0accessing child pornography, possessing child pornography\u00a0and distributing child pornography.\nHe has not been charged with the abduction or murder of C\u00e9drika Provencher, and the allegations contained in the court documents released last week and this motion have not been proven in court.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Markets up sharply, rebounding from 7-day, coronavirus-driven decline", "description": "Rally comes amid hope central banks will cut rates to shore up economies ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/markets-virus-concerns-1.5482163", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5480488.1582924437!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-sign-bmo-february-28-2020.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 02, 2020 10:31 AM ET", "2020-03-03T14:05:45.755Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stocks rose sharply on Wall Street Monday, clawing back some of the losses they took in a seven-day rout brought on by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will stunt the global economy.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 700 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 2.3 per cent, placing in on track for its best day since January 2019. The S&P 500 is coming off a weekly loss of 11.5 per cent, its worst since October 2008 during the global financial crisis.\nDespite the pickup in stocks, the bond market signalled that investors are still worried. Bond prices climbed, pushing yields to more record lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.08 per cent from 1.12 per cent late Friday. Gold, another traditional safe-haven asset, rose 1.7 per cent.\nThe big bounce in stocks came after an especially wild day of trading on Friday in which the Dow sank more than 1,000 points before a late wave of buying left it down 350.\nInvestors are increasingly anticipating that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world will lower interest rates or take other steps to shield the global economy from the effects of the outbreak.\n\"Investors have convinced themselves that global central banks will likely be even more accommodative in order to short-circuit any psychological damage,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\nThe Dow climbed 1,293.96 points, or 5.09\u00a0per cent, to\u00a026,703.32 by market close. The S&P 500 index rose 4.6\u00a0per cent and the Nasdaq gained 4.49 per cent. European benchmarks were mostly higher, and Asian markets rose broadly.\u00a0\nCanada's main stock index, the\u00a0S&P/TSX Composite Index, dipped at opening but was up\u00a0290.21, or 1.8 per cent, to\u00a016,553.26 by day's end.\nThe International Monetary Fund and World Bank announced simultaneously Monday that they are ready to help countries affected by the coronavirus through their emergency lending programs and other tools.\n\"We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible,\" the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, and World Bank President David Malpass said in a joint statement. \"International co-operation is essential.\"\nThe statement echoed similar promises to act if necessary from the Federal Reserve on Friday and the Bank of Japan over the weekend. Some analysts now speculate that the Fed could cut rates sometime this week, before its next formal meeting March 17-18. Traders have priced in a 100 per cent probability that the Fed will cut rates by a half-percentage point during or before its March meeting.\nThere were signs that the economic impact was continuing to mount. A measure of China's manufacturing output plunged last month to its lowest level on record, as the viral outbreak closed factories and disrupted supply chains.\nSeparately, economists at Goldman Sachs slashed their forecasts for U.S. growth to just 0.9 per cent in the first quarter and to zero for the April-June quarter.\nThe Organization for Economic Development, a research organization made up of mostly advanced economies, cut its world growth forecast in a report Monday. The OECD said that even if there are only limited outbreaks outside China, the global economy will grow just 2.4 per cent this year, the weakest since the financial crisis in 2009. That forecast matches several private estimates.\nIf other countries are hit with outbreaks similar to China's, growth could fall as low as 1.5 per cent, the OECD said.\nFor investors, the great amount of uncertainty over how consumer behaviour and spending will be affected has been unsettling.\n\"It's not a typical economic blow,\" said Bill Strazzullo of Bell Curve Trading. \"What if major cities are on some kind of a lockdown? What will that do to restaurants, entertainment, shopping, travel? It's almost impossible to game this out.\"\nLast week's rout knocked every major index into what market watchers call a \"correction,\" or a fall of 10 per cent or more from a peak. Market watchers have said for months that stocks were overpriced and long overdue for another pullback. The last time the market had a drop of that size was in late 2018, when the trade war with China was escalating and investors were worried about rising interest rates.\nThe virus outbreak that began in central China has been shutting down industrial centres, emptying shops and severely crimping travel all over the world. More companies are warning investors that their finances will take a hit because of disruptions to supply chains and sales.\nAs fear over the coronavirus' spread hits consumers, shoppers stocking up on everyday goods helped lift shares in household goods companies. Costco jumped 8.1 per cent. Walmart rose 6 per cent. Procter & Gamble gained 3.5 per cent.\nStocks in travel-related companies have been among the hardest-hit as the outbreak has led to cancelled flights and disrupted vacation plans. Cruise operators continued to pile up losses Monday. Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 2.5 per cent, Norwegian Cruise Line dropped eight\u00a0per cent and Carnival fell 4.7 per cent.\nTechnology and health-care stocks accounted for a big share of the gains. Apple climbed 5.9 per cent and Gilead Sciences rose 6.4 per cent. The biotechnology company has been testing one of its drugs as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.\nGiven that the main economic impact so far of the virus outbreak is on the supply side of economies rather than on the demand side, questions are being asked as to whether looser monetary policy will have any meaningful impact.\n\"For all the talk of lower rates the one thing a rate cut can't do is get people back to work and supply chains back running again,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\nStimulus hopes nevertheless helped shore up markets in Asia earlier. The Nikkei 225 index closed 1 per cent higher, while the Shanghai Composite index rose 3.2 per cent. The benchmark for the smaller exchange, in Shenzhen, jumped 3.8 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.8 per cent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.6 per cent.\nChina has seen most of the 90,000 or so virus cases worldwide. In the United States, authorities have counted at least 80 cases of the virus, two fatal, and concern was driving some to wipe store shelves clean of bottled water, hand sanitizer and other necessities. Both deaths were men with existing health problems who were hospitalized in Washington state.\nOil prices have also slumped as traders price in the prospect of lower demand as a result of the virus outbreak. Last week, oil prices tanked by around 15 per cent. On Monday, benchmark U.S. crude was up $2.07 to $46.83 per barrel. Brent, the international standard, rose $2.28 to $51.95.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Battered stock markets post best day in years as governments fight coronavirus with cash", "description": "Is that light at the end of the tunnel?

That's the best day for the TSX's benchmark index in 43 years, dating back to the creation of its predecessor in 1977.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average had its best day in almost a century, rising 2,112.98 points, or 11.3 per cent, to 20,704. That's the best percentage increase since 1933.\nThe rebounds came after the TSX fell to its lowest level since 2012 on Monday, as more parts of Canada's economy slowed to a crawl, with more jurisdictions moving\u00a0toward lockdowns and mass quarantines.\n\"You've got to put this in context. We've had some horrific days preceding today,\" said Natalie Taylor, a portfolio manager with CIBC.\nGerman stocks jumped 11 per cent\u00a0and British blue chips added nine\u00a0per cent\u00a0as both stock exchanges\u00a0also had their best days\u00a0since 2008.\u00a0South Korea's ravaged market climbed 8.6 per cent\u00a0after the government doubled a planned economic rescue package worth more than\u00a0$80 billion US.\nIn China, mainland stocks posted their biggest gain in three weeks,\u00a0almost three per cent, while Japan's Nikkei soared seven per cent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0its biggest daily gain in four years.\nAmong the reasons for optimism is word out of China that Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak originated, is scheduled to come out of the lockdown it has been in since the end of January. In all, the city will have been locked down for more than 10 weeks, but the easing is\u00a0a sign for investors that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel North America has just entered into.\nAnother reason for optimism is that U.S. lawmakers seem to be lumbering toward some sort of deal in Washington that could see the world's richest economy pour roughly $2 trillion US into offsetting the impact of the virus there, which has shut down large swathes of the economy.\nAnd the G7 group of rich and powerful nations on Tuesday pledged to work together and do whatever it takes to beat the pandemic, including spending money to help poorer vulnerable nations.\nDespite the optimism, the volatility that has waylaid markets is showing no signs of dissipating completely. Wall Street's so-called fear index,\u00a0the VIX, which measures volatility, fell to 52\u00a0points on Tuesday. While that's down from a 12-year high it hit earlier this month, it's still more than twice has high as its historic average of 20, which implies that volatility is twice what it normally is.\nUltimately, markets are likely to keep getting hit with every bleak new story about its spread, since the number of cases is still climbing around\u00a0the world.\n\"We don't know how long it's going to take to peak. We don't know how to treat it. We don't have a vaccine. So all of those uncertainties are causing a myriad of aftershocks,\" said Nancy Perez, senior portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth in Miami.\nOthers were more hopeful that the market may be nearing a bottom.\n\"I think that there's some view that we've had the start of a capitulation in the market,\" Taylor said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/onthecoast/november-22-2019-stock-market-highs-1.5370774", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2409809241", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/jacques-hammer-1.5299156", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/programs/eyeopener/deborah-yedlin-economic-woes-hit-some-alberta-energy-companies-1.5296754", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX and Dow sell off sharply as global recession fears bubble up again", "description": "Dow loses almost 500 points, TSX down by 136.69", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-dollar-markets-1.5305962", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306068.1570037864!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/usa-stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 02, 2019 2:07 PM ET", "2019-10-02T20:46:34.799Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Stock markets just about everywhere sold off on Wednesday amid more signs that the global economy is getting worse and the U.S. government's response will do little to help things.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down at\u00a0494.42\u00a0points to 26,078 after losing\u00a0more than 500 points throughout the day, while in Toronto the S&P/TSX Composite Index closed down at 136.69\u00a0to 16,310 after being down by 194 points throughout the day.\nEuropean shares fared even worse, with benchmark stock indices in France, Germany and Britain all down by at least two per cent.

It bought the maximum allowed 10 per cent of its stock for $119 million under its 2017-18 program.\nSome 627 million shares had been repurchased in 2018 for cancellation by 209 issuer companies as of mid-October, according to data provided by TMX Group, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, at the request of The Canadian Press.\nThat's about 135 million more shares than in all of 2017 and well ahead of the previous record high of 557 million shares in 2007, according to statistics going back to 1989.\nTwenty-three Calgary-based companies involved in the upstream oil and gas sector accounted for about 184 million share buybacks this year, more than double the 76 million in 2017.\nThe boom in energy company share buybacks is linked to conditions in Western Canada, where a lack of pipeline capacity to carry away growing production has resulted in unprecedented discounts in oil prices versus U.S. benchmarks, said Eric Nuttall, senior portfolio manager at Toronto-based Ninepoint Partners.\n\"We've had the greatest dislocation in history between the commodity and the stocks,\" he said. \"Energy stocks are trading at half of their historical multiples.\"\nThe recent decline in New York-traded West Texas Intermediate to the mid-US$50 per barrel level from peaks above US$75 in early October increases the risk of lower returns going forward and makes buybacks less appealing than simply going into \"bunker mode\" and preserving capital, Nuttall said.\n\"But in a higher price commodity environment, meaning like US$60 WTI, and a more normalized differential, if the share price isn't reflecting value, then it's better to buy back your own shares than take the risk of drilling your own wells,\" he said.\nThe appeal of buybacks isn't lost on oilsands major Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. which on Nov. 1 unveiled a new capital allocation strategy that requires half of all future cash after capital spending and dividends be spent on buybacks, with the rest to pay down debt.\nIt repurchased 20 million of its shares as of Sept. 30 at a cost of $874 million under a plan approved last spring to buy back up to 61 million shares over the next year.\nExecutive vice-chairman Steve Laut said on a conference call the \"significant ramp-up\" in buybacks creates \"value for shareholders in current market conditions\" \u2014 on Nov. 1, the company's shares closed at $37.84, down 16 per cent from 12 months earlier.\nEarlier this month, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada's largest oil and gas company by market capitalization, said it had approval to increase its current buyback program to five per cent of its shares from three per cent.\nIt spent $1.98 billion to buy back 39 million shares under the program between last May and November \u2014 the increased program would cost another $1 billion if fully implemented.\nIn theory, reducing the number of outstanding shares in a company increases the value of the remaining shares \u2014 it should boost investor measures such as net earnings per share and production per share and therefore lead to higher market prices for each share.\nThat's not how it has worked out for Trican, however.\nDespite buying and cancelling 34 million shares in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, its share price lost half of its value, falling from $4.56 to $2.31.\nDusterhoft confesses to \"mixed feelings\" about the result but said he still believes buybacks are a strategy that will deliver good returns for shareholders in the long run.\nHe blamed Trican's stock price woes on a general selloff in energy services companies' shares related to poor drilling prospects in Canada as producers limit spending on exploration.\n\"If the share price had stayed the same, they'd get a 10 per cent yield over that time frame. I think the only negative we saw was the market decline through the past year.\"\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Amid coronavirus rout, is it time to shut down the stock market?", "description": "Unprecedented volatility has raised calls for shutdown, but that poses problems, too", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-market-shutdown-1.5501352", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4725096.1530134399!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/germany-dax.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 19, 2020 9:40 AM ET", "2020-03-19T14:15:22.384Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The unprecedented stock market sell-off underway has many Canadians wondering if the time hasn't come to shut down stock markets entirely for a while, in order to give everyone a breather while the world economy deals with the coronavirus.\nCanada's benchmark stock index has lost more than a third of its value in less than three weeks, as investors respond to bleak new coronavirus headlines by selling shares in just about everything. Two of the worst days in the history of the TSX have happened in the past week alone, a pace and depth of selling that eclipses even what was seen during the financial crisis.\nFour times since the start of the sell-off, automatic circuit breakers have kicked in to shut down the markets temporarily amid heavy selling pressure of more than seven\u00a0per cent at a time.\nThose short shutdowns have some people thinking it may be time for a longer, more coordinated one.\u00a0\n\"Things are changing faster than investors can process the impacts and outcomes, and all we're getting is bad news,\" investor Jeff Jongsma\u00a0said in an email to CBC News on Wednesday. \"Perhaps there is value in doing nothing for a few days, to examine the impacts and outcomes?\"\nAndy de Beer, a retiree in Saskatoon, has watched as his savings have been wiped out in the current sell-off, and he estimates he's now back to where he was in 2014. He's in favour of a shutdown mainly because he thinks huge\u00a0institutional traders are making things worse and can find ways of profiting at the expense of smaller investors like him.\n\"Big money managers, the computer-driven sellers and buyers, and the hedge fund operators are driving this for their profit,\" he said. Citing techniques such as short selling and high-frequency trading that allows them to profit on spreads between buy and sell orders, de Beer said these larger investors \"make money every time [that] the rest of us can only hope for.\"\n\"Everybody hates and shames the toilet paper and hand sanitizer profiteers, but nobody is talking about this!\"\nIt's not just retail investors who think it may be time to take a break from it all. Citigroup analyst William O'Donnell wrote in a note to clients this week that it may be time to consider a move that not too long ago he himself would have considered drastic.\n\"This is a World War against the virus, so maybe it's not such a crazy idea,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \"One might not be faulted to assume that a next major step might be to shut the stock markets to prevent a further, self-fueling sell-off.\"\nIf it is a war that we're in, then such a shutdown wouldn't be completely unprecedented. The Toronto Stock Exchange was shut down for several months in the First World War\u00a0and the exchange shut itself down for two days following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The TSX has also had numerous short shutdowns over the years, including mysterious trading glitches last year and last month, in addition to the recent flurry of circuit breakers.\nThe New York Stock Exchange was shut down all those times and more \u2014 most recently\u00a0for two days following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The NYSE was also put on ice after the JFK assassination and when U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt\u00a0mandated a shutdown of the entire banking system for a month during the Great Depression.\nBut for now, the people who run the exchanges don't sound like they are leaning toward a similar extended move.\nJohn McKenzie, interim CEO of the TMX Group, which owns and operates the TSX, called the current sell-off \"an exceptional and evolving situation,\" but added\u00a0that there are no current plans to pull the plug.\u00a0\n\"At this point, TMX feels strongly that it is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders, including\u00a0issuers, investors\u00a0and market participants\u00a0that\u00a0the markets remain open,\" he said in a statement emailed to CBC News.\nThe person in charge of the New York Stock Exchange is even more adamant. NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in a message on social media\u00a0this week it's important for stock markets to stay open \"and for them to function in a fair and orderly manner, as they have been.\"\n\"While we are deeply conscious of, and sympathetic to, investors' concerns around price declines, the market is a reflection of the larger uncertainties that everyone is experiencing during these challenging days. Closing the markets would not change the underlying causes of the market decline, would remove transparency into investor sentiment\u00a0and reduce investors' access to their money,\" she said. \"This would only further compound the current market anxiety.\"\nIt falls well short of a total shutdown, but the NYSE said late Wednesday that it will temporarily close its iconic trading floor in lower Manhattan and move to all-electronic trading beginning Monday as a precautionary step amid the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0\nDespite the sea of red on stock markets right now, Cunningham isn't the only one who thinks the stock market being open is doing some good right now.\nFrances Donald, global chief economist with\u00a0Manulife Investment Management in Toronto, said\u00a0the solution to the market panic isn't less action on the stock market \u2014 it's more.\n\"We are in the midst\u00a0of one of the largest confidence\u00a0shocks that we've seen in the modern economy,\" she said in a phone interview. \"People are scared for not just their physical health but also their financial health, [so] we need to give them access to their money.\"\nWhile Donald\u00a0sympathizes with retail investors waylaid by seeing several years' worth of gains wiped out on paper, she noted that the way through all the fear and uncertainty\u00a0is to keep markets as transparent as possible.\n\"When you want to sell, someone has to buy. If we don't have enough participants in the market, then you see this dysfunction,\" she said. \"If we shut down the market, we are doing the opposite of what this market needs most.\"\nWith files from Reuters and Associated Press\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Shares of most pot companies sell off on 1st day of legalization", "description": "Most big cannabis names lower on Wednesday despite drug becoming legal in Canada", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pot-companies-tsx-1.4866876", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4866985.1562157124!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/canada-marijuana.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 17, 2018 3:20 PM ET", "2018-10-17T21:23:58.630Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Shares in most Canadian marijuana companies were lower on Wednesday, a sign that the volatility that has characterized the space as an investment isn't going to go away now that the drug has been made legal for recreational use.\nCash registers are\u00a0ringing up sales, in person and online, but the reaction from investors in Canadian cannabis companies was soundly underwhelming on the first day of legal weed.\nShares in Canopy Growth Corp. fell out of the gate before see-sawing through the day.

First, that over a year or more, most stocks are still performing incredibly well. Second, that Canada's stock market looks awful when compared to U.S. benchmarks like\u00a0the Dow Jones or the S&P 500.\nAround\u00a0this time last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had just sailed past the 20,000\u00a0mark for the first time. Today, even after the plunge on Monday, the Dow is up a respectable 19\u00a0per cent\u00a0over the past 12 months. Same goes for the S&P 500; factor in Monday's sell-off and the index is still sitting on a nearly 12.5 per cent\u00a0gain.\nSo, investors may have given some gains back on Monday, but they've seen\u00a0a solid year of returns. At least that's the case for stocks traded on \u00a0U.S.\u00a0markets. Canada's TSX tells a very different story. Over 12 months, the TSX\u00a0has fallen\u00a03.1\u00a0per cent.\nLook at a two-year chart tracking the Dow, the S&P 500 and the TSX.\u00a0If you're on a mobile device and it's too tiny all you need to know is the TSX is lagging. Badly.\nAll three indexes stay pretty closely entangled, rising and falling together right up to 2017. By the end of January, the Dow and the S&P start their long climb. The TSX\u00a0forges off on its own. On that two-year timeline, the Dow and the S&P are up 49 per cent\u00a0and 43\u00a0per cent,\u00a0respectively. The laggard TSX\u00a0just 22 per cent.\nUse this handy interactive chart from Yahoo Finance. Look at the\u00a0five-year chart,it's the same story. Scroll out to see how the three indexes have done since the financial crisis in 2008. The TSX\u00a0just isn't keeping up.\nThe date where those three indexes split is no coincidence. The U.S. markets began to climb after Donald Trump was sworn in as president. His promises of tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure fuelled the market rally.\n\"As soon as Trump was in office, (stock markets)\u00a0knew he was going to spend,\" said Conor Bill, managing director of Mt. Auburn Capital. \"His plans for tax cuts were like catnip for the markets. They reacted. They\u00a0continue to react very strongly.\"\nBill said\u00a0Canada's stock market index didn't get any such bump. But more importantly, he said\u00a0the TSX\u00a0is lagging mainly\u00a0because it's composed largely of resource heavy stocks that aren't exactly booming right now.\n\"The tech weighting is incredibly small in the TSX,\" he told CBC News. \"Whereas it's\u00a0much larger in the Dow and the S&P., and tech has been far and away the best-performing sector internationally.\"\nKarl Schamotta\u00a0from Cambridge Global Payments agreed.\n\"Canada remains a laggard in new-economy activity (the country spends more on real estate commissions and transfer costs than on R&D),\" he said in an email.\nHe said\u00a0low oil prices, combined with ongoing pipeline delays\u00a0and a strong dollar mean Canadian oil is trading at an even larger\u00a0discount than usual.\nBut Schamotta said\u00a0there's a deeper problem that the lagging TSX highlights:\u00a0that international investors don't see as much opportunity in Canada right now.\n\"Global markets are increasingly aware that Canadian households are severely indebted \u2014\u00a0meaning that the consumption growth that has long powered the economy is unlikely to be sustained.\"\nAnd therein lies the bigger issue. It's one thing if the country's stock market index isn't performing well. You can change the stocks held in that basket or give them a different weighting.\nSchamotta\u00a0said\u00a0the issue here is that the TSX is actually pretty reflective of our\u00a0economy and the lagging performance is yet more proof that we\u00a0need\u00a0to diversify.\n\"We as an economy need to become more competitive,\" he said.\u00a0\nCanada ranks second last (ahead of only Italy) in the G7 for research and development as a percentage of GDP.

After eight years of phenomenal growth by upending the taxi business, Uber had reached a point where the culture that created the company had become an albatross that threatened to kill it.\nIn a statement, the 40-year-old co-founder said his resignation would help Uber go back to building \"rather than be distracted with another fight,\" an apparent reference to efforts on the board to oust him.\nIt was unclear who would replace Kalanick.\nThe resignation came after a series of costly missteps under Kalanick that damaged Uber's reputation including revelations of sexual harassment in its offices, allegations of trade secrets theft and a federal investigation into efforts to mislead local government regulators.\nOn Tuesday, the company embarked on a 180-day program to change its image by allowing riders to give drivers tips through the Uber app, something Kalanick had resisted. Drivers have said that Kalanick didn't value their labor even though it was the heart of the San Francisco-based company.\nUber's board said in a statement that Kalanick had \"always put Uber first.\"\nBut under Kalanick, the company developed a reputation for ruthless tactics that have occasionally outraged government regulators, drivers, riders and employees. The company often flouted city regulations for taxi companies with a culture that encouraged \"Principled Confrontation.\"\nThe company's hard-charging style has led to legal trouble. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's past usage of phony software designed to thwart local government regulators who wanted to check on whether Uber was carrying passengers without permission.\nA key step toward Kalanick's downfall came in February, when former Uber engineer Susan Fowler posted\u00a0a personal essay\u00a0about the year she spent at Uber, writing that she was propositioned by her manager on her first day with an engineering team. She reported him to human resources, but was told he would get a lecture and no further punishment because he was a \"high performer,\" she wrote.\nThat caught the board's attention and brought outside investigations that led to the firing of 20 people including some managers. Former Attorney General Eric Holder conducted one of the probes, finding that the male-dominated Uber didn't have the most basic policies to protect workers from harassment.\u00a0Holder's report\u00a0suggested procedures that most companies have had for years such as using performance reviews to hold leaders accountable.\nAlso, Kalanick lost his temper in an argument with an Uber driver who was complaining about pay. The profanity-laced confrontation was caught on a video that surfaced in February. Afterward, Kalanick said he needed management help and had to grow up. The company began searching for a chief operating officer.\nIn March, board member Arianna Huffington expressed confidence that Kalanick would evolve into a better leader. But Huffington, a founder of Huffington Post, suggested time might be running out.\nHe's a \"scrappy entrepreneur,\" she said during the call, but one who needed to bring \"changes in himself and in the way he leads.\"\nDuring the past year, several senior managers left the company including the president and chief financial officer.\nOutside experts said the only way to change Uber's culture was for Kalanick to step aside. But Uber's ownership and voting structure made it difficult to oust him.\nKalanick took an indefinite leave of absence earlier this month, in part to deal with a personal tragedy. In May, his mother was killed and his father hurt in a boating accident on a California lake.\nUber was having trouble dealing with its success. It posted a $708 million first-quarter loss, unable to turn $3.4 billion in revenue into a profit.

OPEC doesn't seem to know what they're going to do in terms of production levels,\" he said.\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bombardier shares up as company swings to surprise adjusted profit", "description": "Company posts surprise adjusted profit for second quarter", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-shares-earnings-1.4225947", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4055347.1491336111!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/bombardier-cseries.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jul 28, 2017 11:36 AM ET", "2017-07-28T21:18:24.133Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Bombardier shares rose 4.5 per cent on the TSX on Friday as investors digested the company's latest quarterly results.\nThe Montreal-based plane and train manufacturer\u00a0earned $39 million, or two cents per share, in adjusted profit in the three months up until the end of June.

It also compels disclosure on related aspects including whether the company has a policy for identifying and nominating female directors, and whether there are targets at either the board or executive level, and if not to explain why.\nThe latest data gathered from Canadian securities regulators shows that among the 648 issuers, 15 per cent of board seats were held by women, up from 11 per cent four years earlier.\nCaranci says the comply-or-explain policy has been \"highly effective in a number of areas,\" such as an increase in the share of women on boards across all industries and firm sizes and a decline in the share of boards with zero women.\nHowever, corporate Canada's journey is not yet complete, as most publicly traded companies fall short of the important minimum 30 per cent threshold that constitutes critical mass, she wrote.\nAlso, the comply-or-explain policy has not resulted in a marked improvement representation of women within the senior executive rankings of firms, TD added.\nIn 2011, female representation on boards at U.S. companies on the S&P 500 index outpaced that of Canadian firms on the S&P TSX in eight out of 10 industries, and often by a large margin.\nThe 2018 data, however, demonstrates that the \"tables are turning,\" as Canada now outperforms the U.S. board gender representation in seven of those same 10 industries.\nCanadian companies have usurped their U.S. counterparts on the benchmark index in health care, consumer staples, financials, telecom, utilities, industrials and information technology.\nHowever, TD's analysis showed that Canadian companies' board diversity continues to lag in energy, materials and consumer discretionary sectors.\nThe TSX is more resource-heavy and has a higher prevalence of smaller companies than the S&P 500, they add. Small-sized resource firms capture 30 per cent of all board seats in the S&P/TSX, compared to just 12.5 per cent in the U.S. benchmark index, Caranci and Preston said.\nSmaller companies have slower board seat turnover, and less opportunities to change the status quo, and are more likely to cite limited resources for candidate searches.\n\"I have some sympathy on that part, that you're going to get less progress there,\" Caranci said in an interview. \"I have a little less sympathy when there are things cited about there not being quite enough women, or a supply side issue that I'm not quite buying\u00a0\u2026\u00a0There are so many organizations showcasing board-ready women.\"\nTD estimates if all of Canada's small-sized firms were to hit the tipping point of three women on their boards, that would single-handledly move the entire S&P/TSX index up by 10 percentage points to 34 per cent, she said.\n\"That would only entail about 206 women\u00a0\u2026\u00a0that's not a large amount, that's feasible,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, institutional investors are increasingly pushing for greater female representation on boards by using their voting rights. Caranci and Preston cites such efforts by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) Canada and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.\nFor example, CPPIB said in 2017 it cast votes at the shareholder meetings of 45 Canadian companies with no women directors and engaged with the companies as well, and a year later nearly half had appointed a female to its board.\nThese shareholder initiatives have potential, Caranci said, but it is important to guard against a phenomenon coined \"twokenism,\" in which companies become complacent after adding two or three women on their boards.\n\"If that means that investor scrutiny is less on you and more on those who have zero, that gets you out of the limelight or discontent with shareholders,\" Caranci said. \"You're satisfying a perception or a number, versus actually changing mindsets and practices\u00a0\u2026\u00a0This becomes the one to watch as we go forward.\"\nThese investor efforts should be given time to generate results, given the progress seen by other countries with similar policies that were implemented years earlier, Caranci wrote.\n\"It is likely that Canada's gender representation will continue to improve. If in a few years it is evident that progress has reached a point of stasis, then it might be time to consider designing targeted policy at the trouble spots.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Energy sector soars on OPEC deal, pushing stocks to 18-month high", "description": "OPEC deal to cut output pushes oil close to $50 US a barrel", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-dow-markets-1.3874871", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3036223.1429211113!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/u-s-oil-derrick.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 30, 2016 2:46 PM ET", "2016-11-30T21:59:55.609Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadian stocks soared to an 18-month high on Wednesday following the news that OPEC had reached an agreement to cut its daily oil output by 1.2 million barrels.\n\nThe TSX index closed up 83.04 points at 15,082.85,\u00a0its highest level since the spring of 2015.\n\nThe energy sector powered ahead as the market anticipated a deal to cut world oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting meeting in Vienna.

Much of the world's attention was trained squarely on the U.S. Capitol building, as the the\u00a045th\u00a0U.S. president begins to implement actual policies.\n\"There is very little new material information shaping markets this morning as they are likely going to be influenced by headline watching as the incoming U.S. administration focuses upon signing executive orders and advancing legislative measures fairly rapidly over the coming week and beyond,\" Scotiabank said in a note to clients early Friday morning.\nThe new administration made it clear what its economic priorities would be within minutes of the swearing-in, as the White House's website was updated to remove the Obama\u00a0presidency's policies, and replaced with Trump's.\nThey include:\n\"President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA,\" the trade statement reads.\u00a0\"If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA.\"\nWhile short on details, the move was a clear signal of what the new administration intends to do with regards to the U.S. economy.\nIn a commentary following the inauguration, TD Bank made it clear that there's still much that is unknown for investors.\n\"The details of the policies he will implement in the early days of his mandate, crucial for deducing the impact on the economy, remain to be seen,\" the bank said. \"The cost of the current Republican tax cut plans would require either dramatic cuts in spending or a sizeable rise in the deficit. It is likely that the final package will be more modest, and provide less of a near-term economic boost than markets expect.\"\nDespite the uncertainty, the buoyant mood spilled over into\u00a0Canadian stocks, as the S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 138.07\u00a0points to 15,547.88.\nThe March crude oil contract was at $53.22 US, up $1.10, while the February contract was at $52.42, up $1.05, on lighter volume.\nThat wasn't enough to buoy the loonie, however, which closed down 0.07 of a cent to 75.04\u00a0cents US. The Canadian dollar has fallen all week, having been at 77 cents following the Martin Luther King holiday on Monday.\nBoth the Canadian dollar\u00a0and the Mexican peso slipped after Trump's speech reiterated the anti-globalist\u00a0approach that the new administration seems poised to deploy.\n"}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "Stock exchanges opt for lottery to award POT ticker symbol to some lucky company", "description": "POT used to be owned by PotashCorp but will be up for grabs at end of January", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pot-ticker-symbol-cannabis-1.4980062", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4980075.1547646422!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/stock-ticker-board.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Jan 16, 2019 8:56 AM ET", "2019-01-16T21:18:14.819Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Canadian stock exchanges have decided to award the rights to use the \"POT\" ticker symbol via a lottery, after a deluge of requests for the marijuana-related moniker.\nAfter what the exchanges call \"significant interest\" in using the symbol, the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange,\u00a0and the Aequitas Exchange have jointly announced that they will award the right to use the ticker symbol P-O-T via a randomized lottery on Jan. 30.\nThe symbol was held for years and years by Saskatchewan fertilizer giant PotashCorp., which traded on the TSX. But Potash merged with Agrium in a deal completed last January, and the combined firm decided to call itself Nutrien Inc., listing itself under a new ticker, NTR, also on the TSX.\nUnder current rules, a ticker symbol must be dormant for a minimum of 53 weeks before it is up for grabs to a new company, and\u00a0that waiting period just expired.\u00a0The sudden availability of POT seems to have whet the appetites of a number of Canadian cannabis companies who want to use it, which is why the exchanges have taken the extraordinary step of awarding it by lottery.\nMost companies tend to try to get a ticker symbol that is some sort of\u00a0 abbreviated version of the letters in their name, such as MSFT for Microsoft, BRK for Berkshire Hathaway, and C for Citibank.\nProminent Canadian examples include Canadian Pacific Rail, which lists under the symbol CP, the Bank of Montreal, whose ticker symbol is BMO, and\u00a0BlackBerry, which lists under BBRY on the Nasdaq.\u00a0(When BlackBerry was known as Research In Motion, its ticker symbol at the time was RIMM.)\nDavid Baskin, president of Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, said there is some history of companies choosing to list with ticker symbols that spell out an iconic phrase, such as\u00a0garbage management firm\u00a0Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. which traded under the symbol BIN before being bought out by a larger rival, and Canada's largest cannabis company, Canopy Growth Corp., which already trades under the punny symbol of WEED on the TSX.\n\"Are more people likely to buy the shares with a cute ticker?I kind of tend to doubt it,\"\u00a0\u00a0he said in an interview. \"But it's not the first time this has happened.\"\nFinance professor Steve Foerster\u00a0at Ivey Business School in London, Ont., said there is some evidence of a relationship between ticker symbols and company performance.\u00a0He cited a\u00a0recent study in the Journal of Financial Markets\u00a0that found a relationship between the likeability of a company's stock ticker and how it does on the stock market.\nThe study found some evidence that companies with easy-to-pronounce ticker symbols outperformed other ones, all things being equal.\n\"If markets are truly efficient, then the ticker symbol shouldn't matter,\" he said in an interview, \"but the conclusion there is that there may be something to whoever becomes the winner of the POT symbol.\"\nThe exchanges haven't said what companies have applied to use the listing, but it's not hard to see why a cannabis company would find POT appealing.\nCannabis companies are particularly attractive to retail investors, as the mania for pot stocks has made trading in some of the big cannabis names make up the majority of all activity on the TSX of late, Baskin noted.\n\"It's retail traffic,\u00a0so maybe getting that ticker would propel your stock price,\" he says.\nThe exchanges say eligible participants who want to enter the POT lottery must notify the exchange where they are currently listed, or want to be listed, by 5 p.m. on Jan. 29. From that day, they'll have 90 days to meet the listing requirement, or the symbol will go back into a lottery for someone else to use.\nWhoever wins the lottery won't be allowed to quickly flip the listing to anyone else, either.\n\"The symbol reservation will be non-transferrable and only the selected participant will be permitted to use the symbol,\" the Canadian Securities Exchange said in a press release.\nIf a cannabis company ends up with the winning ticket it would be oddly appropriate, Baskin said.\n\"It's a sideshow, but the whole industry is a sideshow,\" he said. \"The valuations\u00a0are nonsensical, so why shouldn't they be a little silly?\"\n"}, {"author": "Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani", "title": "Markets react to trade talks: Investors are betting on a U.S.-Canada deal", "description": "The Canadian dollar is flying high on the prospect of a trade deal, but will it last?", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-trade-canada-us-mexico-1.4801661", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4641263.1525090648!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dollar-markets-20180205-tsx-sign-tmx.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 28, 2018 2:50 PM ET", "2018-08-28T20:51:24.939Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "When the U.S. and Mexico reached a bilateral trade agreement without Canada on Monday, it was the end of NAFTA as we know it.\nBut stock markets rallied on the news, with Canadian stocks\u00a0hitting their\u00a0highest point in more than a month.

court ruled Friday against B.C.-based Nevsun Resources (TSX:NSU), which had argued the claim should not proceed because a Canadian court could not decide the legality of acts by foreign states.\nThree refugees from Eritrea in eastern Africa allege they were forced to work at a gold, copper and zinc mine owned and operated by the Bisha Mining Share Company, which is controlled by Nevsun.\nThey contend construction of the mine flouted international legal provisions against forced labour, slavery and torture \u2014 accusations that have not been tested in court.\nNevsun denies that the company or its subsidiary enlisted the Eritrean military to build the mine or supply labour, and says the refugees behind the court action were not mistreated.\nB.C. courts dismissed Nevsun's attempts to make Eritrea the forum for any lawsuit.\nIn its decision, the Supreme Court rejected the company's argument that Canadian courts are precluded from assessing the sovereign acts of a foreign government, including Eritrea's national military service program.\nThe court also noted that customary international law \u2014 the common law of the international legal system \u2014 embraces fundamental norms, including prohibitions against slavery, forced labour and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\nCustomary international law is part of Canadian law, Justice Rosalie Abella wrote on behalf of a majority of the court.\n\"Nevsun is a company bound by Canadian law. It is not 'plain and obvious' to me that the Eritrean workers' claims against Nevsun based on breaches of customary international law cannot succeed. Those claims should therefore be allowed to proceed.\"\nNevsun said in a statement Friday it expects a trial of the plaintiffs' claims and those of other, similar claimants will take place in the B.C. Supreme Court in September of next year.\nNevsun said it intends to \"vigorously defend itself in court,\" adding it expects the Bisha Mining Share Co. will continue to operate the mine according to high standards of governance, workplace conditions, health, safety and proper protection of human rights.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Loblaw sells chain of 213 gas stations to Brookfield for $540M", "description": "Analyst expects more gas station networks to be sold off until politicians step in to ensure competition", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/loblaw-gas-station-brookfield-1.4075290", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4075301.1492605683!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/mobil-gas-station-sign.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 19, 2017 8:49 AM ET", "2017-04-19T17:49:45.302Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Loblaw is selling its network of 213 gas stations and attached convenience stores to a unit of TSX-listed Brookfield Business Partners for $540 milion.\nThe grocery chain announced the news in a release Wednesday morning.

That's the lowest level the stock has been since the spring of 2013. It closed down 14.7 per cent at $78.77 US.\nThree months ago, Valeant was the most valuable company in Canada, but the company has lost almost two-thirds of its value since then as it has been rocked by two negative stories: American outrage over the pricing of generic drugs, and allegations from a short seller that the company's accounting practices don't add up.\nThe Senate's special committee on aging requested documents and information Wednesday from Turing,\u00a0Valeant\u00a0Pharmaceuticals and two other\u00a0drugmakers\u00a0already under scrutiny for recent price spikes.\nThe Senate's special committee on aging, which is headed by Maine Republican\u00a0Senator\u00a0Susan Collins and Missouri Democratic Senator\u00a0Claire\u00a0McCaskill, has scheduled a hearing for next month, demanding Valeant and three other drug companies appear to explain their pricing policies amid recent spikes.\nThe senators called for a face-to-face meeting with Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO\u00a0Martin Shkreli, \"as soon as it is practicable.\" A former hedge fund manager, Shkreli has become the public face of the pricing controversy, after his company raised the price of the anti-infection drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent.\nThe drug, which Turing acquired in August, is the only U.S.-approved treatment for a deadly parasitic infection that can affect pregnant women and patients with HIV.\nTuring said in an emailed statement: \"We are reviewing the committee's request and, as we have and continue to do with similar congressional inquiries, we look forward to having an open and honest dialogue about drug pricing.\"\nThere's also a request to issue subpoenas to collect documents from Turing and Valeant.\u00a0Both firms have refused to turn over documents requested by Democrats on the House oversight committee.\n\"We need to get to the bottom of why we're seeing huge spikes in drug prices that seemingly have no relationship to research and development costs,\" said McCaskill, in a statement. She added that some of the increases resemble \"little more than price gouging.\"\nThe committee also sent letters to Retrophin Inc. of San Diego and Rodelis Therapeutics of Alpharetta, Georgia. The lawmakers question Retrophin about its decision to raise the price of a kidney drug, Thiola, from $1.50 per tablet to $30 per tablet.

The current run beats the previous title holder that ran from the 1990s through the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000.\nThe S&P 500 has more than quadrupled\u00a0since 2009, while the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average has done almost as well. Buoyed by the so-called FAANG stocks, the tech-laden Nasdaq has done even better \u2014 up by 500 per cent. (The TSX, if you were wondering, has barely doubled over that same stretch, held back by the oil price collapse of 2015.)\nTo David Rosenberg, chief economist at\u00a0Gluskin Sheff\u00a0investment firm, the reason why the U.S. bull run began is simple.\n\"A\u00a0good part of this stock market rally that we had this cycle was just digging ourselves out of the hole we had during the great recession,\" he says.\u00a0\nFaced with bank failures, a plunging housing market and widespread fears of financial collapse,\u00a0policy makers did whatever they could to try to turn things around. A big weapon in their arsenal was to cut interest rates, flooding the world's economy with cheap money in the hopes it would encourage investors to spend it.\nIt worked, but it came with a bill that some say investors have yet to pay: debt.\n\"The way we got out of the crisis was by fuelling more borrowing,\" says Christian Lawrence, a senior market strategist with Dutch bank Rabobank. All that cheap money lit a fire under all sorts of assets, sparking the rally that continues to this day. But in the process it\u00a0increased debt levels, and left many people behind in the process.\n\"If\u00a0you own assets it's been great,\" he says of the longest bull run in history, \"but if you're just in a normal income-paying job and you don't\u00a0own assets then perhaps this stock market rally has come at your expense.\"\nLawrence says in the U.S., households now have bigger student debt and subprime car loans than they did before the financial crisis, and their ability to pay it back is even worse because they're not earning as much.\n\"Unless we start to see wage growth picking up, this could be a dangerous position.\"\nLawrence argues the current stock market boom has to run out of steam sooner rather than later, but that's not a universal view.\nBarry Schwartz, chief investment officer at the financial firm Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, says bull markets tend to end once investors have entered a state of euphoria, when valuations are out of control.\n\"I don't think we're anywhere near euphoria,\" he says, adding that if we were, \"I\u00a0wouldn't be\u00a0getting calls from clients saying 'I'm worried about Donald Trump and what he's going to do.'\"\nWorrying about Donald Trump was certainly conventional wisdom\u00a0after Trump's surprise election win in 2016, when the initial reaction was to get out of the stock market. What ended up happening, of course, is that stocks have since hit even higher highs, backed by a massive tax cut package and the easing\u00a0of onerous regulations.\nHis sabre rattling on trade, however, seems to be giving investors some pause, as the S&P 500 has slumped since January when tariff talk began. To Rabobank's Lawrence, Trump's trade wars could be just the thing to snuff out the stock market rally.\nTariffs on imported goods\u00a0\"certainly pose a risk to U.S. companies going forward,\" Lawrence\u00a0says, \"and if we see inflation from higher goods prices that will squeeze families on consumption.\"\nLess consumption means less spending, which means lower profits and likely lower stock prices\u00a0for companies.\nOne canary in the coal mine for Rosenberg\u00a0is how few companies are actually participating in the current rising stock market tide. Only about 10 per cent of the companies on the S&P are seeing their shares rise right now, he calculates, but they are big and influential enough to cause the overall index to keep inching higher.\n\"We're on the verge of one of the longest expansions the\u00a0U.S. has ever seen,\" Lawrence says.\u00a0\"But it's\u00a0a very shallow expansion.\"\nLawrence says the thing that worries\u00a0him more than debt is the rise of inequality. That may not feel like a concern for stock market investors, but inequality should be on their radar because of the uncertainty it creates. \"There are people that are being left behind and those that own assets are increasingly accelerating away from those people.\"\nA pushback against inequality was a factor in the rise of Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in Britain, he notes, and there's no reason to think the same sort of unexpected event can't happen in stock markets. \"Another crash at some point is inevitable,\" he says, \"but\u00a0it's the timing of it that's difficult to predict.\"\nIn and of itself,\u00a0Rosenberg doesn't see any reason to worry about the end of a\u00a0bull run, just because the current one is getting long in the tooth. But he does admit that two little words are a bigger risk to stock market investors than any others.\n\"What usually ends bull markets ... in two words, are interest rates,\" Rosenberg says. \"And it won't be different this time around.\"\nWith files from Peter Armstrong, Laura MacNaughton and Meegan Read\n\n\n"}, {"author": "Lucas Powers", "title": "China's market woes could be chance to 'reset' Canadian economy", "description": "Canada should 'rely less on commodity growth and put the emphasis on other sectors,' analyst says", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-markets-stocks-1.3202024", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3202479.1440460593!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/china-stock-market-slide.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Aug 25, 2015 5:00 AM ET", "2015-08-30T12:37:58.029Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "\nChina's staggering economic growth has been, in many ways, a boon for Canada.\u00a0\u00a0\nPut simply, China need lots of the things we have to offer like wood, metals, and potash.

The Economist magazine reported last week that the prices of all major commodities have fallen between 10 and 20 per cent this year, heralding the end of a so-called super-cycle that began in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile it's unclear how this week's sell-off in China will ultimately impact commodity prices, the lack of transparency surrounding what further mitigation measures the Chinese authorities might take is not doing much to assuage market fears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Commodities are already under pressure, even before the uncertainty in with Chinese stocks. It's really not new,\" says Nakamoto.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"But there will be a price point where more producers will have to shut down some operations and scale back their capacity.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This doesn't mean there will be a complete downturn in the commodity trade with China,\" says Peter Dungan, an economist at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"China still need to fuel its power plants, it still needs wood and steel to build new things like hospitals and office towers ... There is still an appetite for resources.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe global fall in commodity prices, particularly oil, has precipitated a drop in the value of the Canadian dollar, which sank to an 11-year low of 75.27 US cents by the close of trading on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA low Canadian dollar certainly presents \"a challenge in the short run,\" but it could prove an opportunity to \"hit the reset button\" on the Canadian economy, says author Jeff Rubin, a former chief economist at CIBC World Markets, adding that \"we've become hugely skewed to the resource sector in a fashion that is really unprecedented.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nAs in previous decades, a low dollar could encourage the resurgence of sectors hit hard by the focus on resource exploration and extraction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"A whole range of industries that have been inversely affected by the exchange rate and focus on the resource-based economy are going to come out the shadows,\" he says, adding that he believes the Canadian dollar will stabilize around 70 US cents and hover around that value for the foreseeable future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\"The revitalization in these sectors obviously won't happen overnight, but there will be traction after a few years.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Scotiabank, Royal drop Woodstock bong business", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/scotiabank-royal-drop-marijuana-businesses-1.3758060", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Sep 12, 2016 9:15 AM ET", "2016-09-12T20:29:02.472Z"], "source": null, "content": "After a decade-long relationship with Scotiabank (TSX:BNS), Hemp Country owner Nathan MacLellan says he received a letter from the bank late last month stating his account was being cancelled.\nThe store in Woodstock, Ont., sells marijuana-related items such as pipes and bongs but no actual cannabis, MacLellan says. \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's kind of insulting really, especially when legalization is right on the horizon,\" he says.\n\"Nothing in the store that we sell is illegal.

The current run beats the previous title holder that ran from the 1990s through the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000.\nThe S&P 500 has more than quadrupled\u00a0since 2009, while the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average has done almost as well. Buoyed by the so-called FAANG stocks, the tech-laden Nasdaq has done even better \u2014 up by 500 per cent. (The TSX, if you were wondering, has barely doubled over that same stretch, held back by the oil price collapse of 2015.)\nTo David Rosenberg, chief economist at\u00a0Gluskin Sheff\u00a0investment firm, the reason why the U.S. bull run began is simple.\n\"A\u00a0good part of this stock market rally that we had this cycle was just digging ourselves out of the hole we had during the great recession,\" he says.\u00a0\nFaced with bank failures, a plunging housing market and widespread fears of financial collapse,\u00a0policy makers did whatever they could to try to turn things around. A big weapon in their arsenal was to cut interest rates, flooding the world's economy with cheap money in the hopes it would encourage investors to spend it.\nIt worked, but it came with a bill that some say investors have yet to pay: debt.\n\"The way we got out of the crisis was by fuelling more borrowing,\" says Christian Lawrence, a senior market strategist with Dutch bank Rabobank. All that cheap money lit a fire under all sorts of assets, sparking the rally that continues to this day. But in the process it\u00a0increased debt levels, and left many people behind in the process.\n\"If\u00a0you own assets it's been great,\" he says of the longest bull run in history, \"but if you're just in a normal income-paying job and you don't\u00a0own assets then perhaps this stock market rally has come at your expense.\"\nLawrence says in the U.S., households now have bigger student debt and subprime car loans than they did before the financial crisis, and their ability to pay it back is even worse because they're not earning as much.\n\"Unless we start to see wage growth picking up, this could be a dangerous position.\"\nLawrence argues the current stock market boom has to run out of steam sooner rather than later, but that's not a universal view.\nBarry Schwartz, chief investment officer at the financial firm Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto, says bull markets tend to end once investors have entered a state of euphoria, when valuations are out of control.\n\"I don't think we're anywhere near euphoria,\" he says, adding that if we were, \"I\u00a0wouldn't be\u00a0getting calls from clients saying 'I'm worried about Donald Trump and what he's going to do.'\"\nWorrying about Donald Trump was certainly conventional wisdom\u00a0after Trump's surprise election win in 2016, when the initial reaction was to get out of the stock market. What ended up happening, of course, is that stocks have since hit even higher highs, backed by a massive tax cut package and the easing\u00a0of onerous regulations.\nHis sabre rattling on trade, however, seems to be giving investors some pause, as the S&P 500 has slumped since January when tariff talk began. To Rabobank's Lawrence, Trump's trade wars could be just the thing to snuff out the stock market rally.\nTariffs on imported goods\u00a0\"certainly pose a risk to U.S. companies going forward,\" Lawrence\u00a0says, \"and if we see inflation from higher goods prices that will squeeze families on consumption.\"\nLess consumption means less spending, which means lower profits and likely lower stock prices\u00a0for companies.\nOne canary in the coal mine for Rosenberg\u00a0is how few companies are actually participating in the current rising stock market tide. Only about 10 per cent of the companies on the S&P are seeing their shares rise right now, he calculates, but they are big and influential enough to cause the overall index to keep inching higher.\n\"We're on the verge of one of the longest expansions the\u00a0U.S. has ever seen,\" Lawrence says.\u00a0\"But it's\u00a0a very shallow expansion.\"\nLawrence says the thing that worries\u00a0him more than debt is the rise of inequality. That may not feel like a concern for stock market investors, but inequality should be on their radar because of the uncertainty it creates. \"There are people that are being left behind and those that own assets are increasingly accelerating away from those people.\"\nA pushback against inequality was a factor in the rise of Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in Britain, he notes, and there's no reason to think the same sort of unexpected event can't happen in stock markets. \"Another crash at some point is inevitable,\" he says, \"but\u00a0it's the timing of it that's difficult to predict.\"\nIn and of itself,\u00a0Rosenberg doesn't see any reason to worry about the end of a\u00a0bull run, just because the current one is getting long in the tooth. But he does admit that two little words are a bigger risk to stock market investors than any others.\n\"What usually ends bull markets ... in two words, are interest rates,\" Rosenberg says. \"And it won't be different this time around.\"\nWith files from Peter Armstrong, Laura MacNaughton and Meegan Read\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Toronto weather: Wednesday, Dec. 23, 2015", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-weather-wednesday-1.3377790", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2643686.1450865650!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/fog-advisory.jpeg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 23, 2015 5:17 AM ET", "2015-12-23T10:17:24.979Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Good morning!\nToronto is under a fog advisory early this morning.

Its chief executive Richard Carleton said he expects at least five more U.S.-based pot company listings in the coming months.\nEarlier this month, Los Angeles-based cannabis retailer MedMen announced it will use a reverse takeover to list on the CSE later this year. The so-called Starbucks of weed,\u00a0which has sleek stores in California, Nevada and New York, MedMen has also entered into a joint venture with Canadian licensed producer Cronos Group and aims to serve Canadian customers later this year once recreational pot is legal.\nIt's official! On 4/20, we open in NYC. <a href=\"https://t.co/cMwTF62HAM\">https://t.co/cMwTF62HAM</a>\nMeanwhile, Cronos in March became the first cannabis company to list on New York's Nasdaq exchange, with rivals Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis later saying publicly they are eyeing a Nasdaq listing as well.\nCronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said while there are more stringent rules to follow on the Nasdaq, and it won't be able to get a physical foothold in the U.S. before it is federally legal, the strategy is still advantageous.\n\"We're able to then get U.S. investors in while we're still in the early days, and have that support when we operationally enter the U.S.,\" he said in an interview.\nThe flurry of activity comes as Washington's political tone seems to have softened toward the drug.\nThe Trump administration was initially hostile to an Obama-era memorandum that suggested the U.S. federal government would not intervene in states where the drug is legal.\nThat prompted TMX Group, Canada's biggest exchange operator, to warn issuers with ongoing cross-border activities that they are not in compliance with its requirements and could face delisting.\nThe TMX Group's stance helped to cement the CSE's position as the go-to exchange for cannabis companies, allowing issuers to have U.S. exposure, provided they disclose to investors the inherent risks.\nThe Trump administration has recently cooled its rhetoric on marijuana enforcement.\nSen. Cory Gardner from Colorado, one of the first states to legalize the drug for recreational use said earlier this month he received a commitment from Trump that his administration's stance would not impact Colorado's legal marijuana industry, and that the president would support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized the drug.\nThis shift in tone is \"tremendously positive for the U.S. cannabis sector,\" said Vahan Ajamian, an analyst with Beacon Securities.\n\"While we will have to wait to see legislation actually pass, in our view, this turn of events could take the sector to a much more secure state than during the Cole Memo,\" he said in a recent note to clients.\nOther American politicians are also warming up to cannabis, with former Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner joining the advisory board of a marijuana company and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo preparing to legalize the drug in his state. On Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he plans to introduce new legislation in the U.S. Senate to do so.\nThese developments help de-risk the industry and \"U.S. cannabis operators represent the next wave of outsized returns,\" Ajamian added.\nThe increasing potential for legal cannabis in the U.S. has some Canadian pot companies jumping through hoops to meet exchange requirements north of the border while ensuring one foot in the market south of the border \u2014 to the benefit of Canada's alternative exchanges.\nLast Tuesday, pre-licence cannabis producer Maple Leaf Green World got final approval to migrate its listing from the TSX Venture exchange to the alternative NEO exchange.\n\nMaple Leaf chief executive Raymond Lai said it voluntarily delisted its shares and called the TMX Group's stance on cannabis \"short sighted.\"\n\"We feel that the U.S. market is so huge\u2026.\u00a0We are really frustrated with the TSX position on marijuana companies and business with the U.S.,\" he said.\nTMX group spokesperson\u00a0Shane Quinn said the exchange operator is aware that legislation in the hot new sector \"continues to evolve.\"\n\"While we continue to monitor legal developments affecting this sector, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the U.S. federal Controlled Substances Act. From our perspective, United States federal law has jurisdiction over state law in this matter.\"\nMeanwhile, Jos Schmitt, the chief executive of Aequitas NEO, said he expects at least two more new cannabis-related listings on their upstart exchange.\n\"When we have here in Canada the opportunity to cater to a business that is going to grow and that is going to be beneficial to our economy, well, we're going to be supporters and favourable to that, within the regulatory framework.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "As It Happens: Thursday Edition", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5298288", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Sep 26, 2019 5:45 PM ET", "2019-09-26T21:45:01.448Z"], "source": "CBC Radio", "content": "Episode Transcript\nPart One\nJacques Chirac obit Former Quebec Premier Jean Charest remembers his friend Jacques Chirac \u2014 the French President whose drive for power was so relentless his countrymen called him \"Le Bulldozer\".\nTSX Alberta energy His company's lost so much value it's been delisted from Canada's main market index \u2014 which is why Kevin Neveu is shifting its focus from Alberta to the U.S.\nSwiss glacier funeral He was intimately familiar with the deceased \u2014 which is why Swiss glaciologist Matthias Huss gave a tribute at the funeral for an Alpine glacier that's all but melted away.\u00a0\nPart Two\nTrump Impeachment: Democrat A whistleblower says Donald Trump abused his power, and the White House put the evidence in \"lockdown\" \u2014 and a Democratic Congresswoman says that's clear proof the President should be impeached.\u00a0\nPolish teen journal All 700 pages of the Second World War diary of Renia Spiegel, a Polish teenager who was killed by the Nazis, are now published in English.\u00a0\nPart Three\nDental hygienist A dental hygienist in Ontario is crushed after losing his license.

Consider not just living expenses, but also health costs, charitable giving and how much to leave to the children, Maiorino said.\n\"If you are retiring, you won't use all your money next year. If you tell me you plan to retire at age 60, you have 20 to 25 years of time to make your money last,\" he said.\n\"Put some of the money in money market, GICs, bonds, where the rates of returns are low but so is the risk, but as we look further out, we can look at growth investments [with part of the money],\" he added.\nWhat investment you buy with any cash you have on hand in the first two months of the year depends in part on what you already own, says Jeff Singer, chief investment officer at Investors Group.\n\"You don't want too many eggs in one basket,\" he said.\nIt's better to have a diversified portfolio of investments and to put money into your RRSP regularly, he said.\n\"Don't try and time the market,\" he warns. \"The typical investor is very emotional.

Her government is prepared to sell off up to 60 per cent of the utility, aiming to fetch some $9 billion.\n\nSome $5 billion of the final share sales are\u00a0earmarked for Hydro One's debt; the rest, says Wynne, will go toward\u00a0Ontario's $130-billion commitment to building new infrastructure, such as transit.\n\n\"That historic investment in infrastructure is not possible unless we have the resources,\" said Wynne\u00a0on Friday, in her last news conference before leaving the country on a 15-day trade mission. \"Part of that is leveraging the assets that we own, including Hydro One.\"\n\nEffectively, Ontario is selling off its transmission lines to help pay some of the cost of transit lines.\n\nBy not putting all of its shares up for sale at once, Ontario is aiming to avoid the shortcomings of previous federal privatizations \u2014\u00a0such as Air Canada and CN Rail\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and cash in on what the government expects will be growth in Hydro One's share price over the coming years.\n\n\"We've done this in a very careful approach,\" said Sousa. \u00a0\n\nBut both opposition parties are not impressed.\n\n\n\"There is no justification for it,\" NDP Leader Andrea Horwath told CBC News\u00a0on Wednesday. \"There are many, many ways to pay for that infrastructure, and the Liberals have taken the worst possible decision,\" she said.\n\n\"We're losing control over one of the most important public assets here in the province,\" said Horwath. \"Why is this happening?\"\n\n\"It's a one-time payout with long-term negative consequences,\" said PC Leader Patrick Brown in question period\u00a0on Tuesday. \"Everyone in Ontario will pay for this bad deal.\"\n\nThe opposition parties' arguments are not changing the Wynne government's direction. Nor is the recent report by Ontario's\u00a0Financial Accountability Officer Stephen LeClair, which says\u00a0the sale will in the long\u00a0run leave the province worse off than if Hydro One stayed\u00a0in public hands.\n\nThe Liberals did not campaign in the 2014 election on a promise to sell off Hydro One.

For example, the concept for CIBC's Apple Watch app was developed in around six weeks, Williamson said.\nThe bank has been using the space to experiment with a variety of new technologies, including voice authentication similar to Apple's Siri, that would allow customers to use their voices not only to access their accounts but also to perform a variety of tasks such as pay bills, transfer money and even seek advice about budgeting.\nHowever, Williamson said it's important to determine whether customers are ready for the technology before the bank moves forward. CIBC is currently conducting research to determine how much appetite clients have for voice-authenticated banking.\n\"This is all about the client,\" said Williamson. \"We need to put out things that make banking better for them ... if they think it's creepy, they won't adopt.\"\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "OSC to accept 'no-contest' settlement agreements", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/osc-to-accept-no-contest-settlement-agreements-1.2568527", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2568620.1450865674!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tsx-20111230.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 11, 2014 3:57 PM ET", "2014-03-11T21:25:53.316Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Ontario Securities Commission has decided to let some individuals and\u00a0companies settle misconduct disputes with the regulator without formally having to admit to any wrongdoing.\nThe new policy, often referred to as a no-contest settlement, is aimed at speeding up the whole enforcement process.\nUnder the old rules, the OSC required some admission of wrongdoing before a settlement could\u00a0take place.

Gold mining companies are the biggest drivers of the materials sector, which accounts for 14 per cent of the TSX.\nSo when the gold sector does well \u2014\u00a0and it has more than doubled since the start of this year \u2014\u00a0that really helps to boost the whole TSX index.\nIn fact, recent strength in gold and other extracted commodities has given Canada the second-best-performing developed market in the world this year, according to Bloomberg data, trailing only New Zealand.\nGold's weighting in the TSX stock market is just one example of how the economy bears little resemblance to the stock market. But it's not the only one.\nOil and gas stocks account for up to a quarter of the main TSX index. While energy is an important part of the Canadian economy, it doesn't account for a quarter of it.\nIan\u00a0Nakamoto, chief market strategist at\u00a03Macs\u00a0in Toronto, puts it simply:\u00a0\"The Canadian stock market is just not representative of the Canadian economy.\"\u00a0\nLast Friday, Canada and the U.S. both released employment figures. The U.S. economy churned out 255,000 jobs in July, far above what economists were expecting. The Canadian economy, on the other hand, disappointed with an unexpected jobs decline.\nYet stock markets in both the U.S. and Canada staged big gains.\n\"Because we are so tied to the U.S., we piggy-back on top of their data,\" Small says, noting that Canada exports a lot of what we make and pull out of the ground.\nSo if the U.S. economy is doing relatively well, stocks here that have significant exposure to the U.S. market will tend to\u00a0benefit.\n\"The U.S. is the largest economy in the world,\" notes\u00a03Macs' Nakamoto. \"So there's a sense, if they're doing well, it will spill over to other economies.\"\nLow interest rates aren't just driving housing prices higher.

Big numbers, for sure. Had those numbers held, the Dow would have suffered its largest one-day point drop ever.\nBut the fall would've been nowhere near the biggest percentage-wise.\nHere's a list of some of the largest one-day swings on the markets.\nOct. 15, 2008:\u00a0The Dow falls 733.08 points \u2014 or 7.87 per cent \u2014 to close at 8,577.91.

At a loss of 7.13 per cent, it's the 17th largest drop in terms of percentage points.\nDec. 1, 2008:\u00a0The Dow sheds 679.95 points to close at 8,149.09 points for the fourth-largest point drop ever. It's the 12th largest drop percentage-wise at 7.7 per cent. The TSX, meanwhile, posted its largest-ever point drop at 846.41 points to close at 8,406.21. Percentage-wise, the fall is 9.3 per cent, second only to the 11.3 per cent plunge on Black Monday \u2014 Oct. 19, 1987. While the fall is connected to ongoing global financial difficulties, it coincides with the day that the federal Liberals, New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois sign a deal to form a coalition government, if they are successful in beating the Conservatives in a vote of no-confidence.\nOct. 9, 2008:\u00a0As the global economy sputters, the Dow sheds another 678.91 points \u2014 or 7.33 per cent. In Toronto, the TSX gave up 456 points to close at 9,600 \u2014 a drop of 4.5 per cent. The day had started off on a promising note: the TSX was up 300 points shortly after the opening bell, only to head steeply downward after sentiment turned bearish.\nOct. 19, 1987:\u00a0The pullback on Black Monday was 508 points in New York \u2014 only the 11th-largest in terms of points, but it was the biggest percentage-wise at 22.61 per cent. The Toronto market closed down 11 per cent, posting a loss of 407.2 points.\nOct. 28, 1929: The original Black Monday saw the Dow fall by 38.33 points \u2014 an unprecedented fall. The market closed at 260.64 that day, which represented a tumble of 12.82 per cent. That's the second biggest fall on record. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday and \u2014 a week later \u2014 Black Thursday, which saw drops of 11.73 per cent and 9.92 per cent respectively.\nOct. 13, 2008:\u00a0In the largest-ever point gain in the Dow's history, the industrial average shot up by 936.42 points \u2014 or 11.08 per cent. The gain was the fifth largest in terms of per cent. It came in the midst of the economic woes of 2008, as governments around the world committed trillions to easing the global credit crunch. Markets in Canada were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.\nOct. 28, 2008:\u00a0The October 2008 roller coaster continued with a gain of 889.35 points in New York \u2014 or 10.88 per cent. That was the sixth largest gain ever in terms of per cent. The TSX rose 614.29 points, or 7.2 per cent, to close at 9,151.63.\nNov. 13, 2008:\u00a0The Dow surges 552.59 points to close at 8,835.25 \u2014 an increase of 6.67 per cent. TSX was up 430 points, or 4.8 per cent, to close the session at 9,352. That represented a huge turnaround. In early trading, the TSX was off 300 points.\nMar. 16, 2000: The Dow gains 499.19 points to close at 10,630.60 points \u2014 an increase of 4.93 per cent.\nMar. 15, 1933: While the Dow only ticked up 8.16 points, it represented an increase of 15.34 per cent.

The site is\u00a0125 kilometers west of the Voiseys Bay nickel-copper-cobalt deposit currently being mined by Vale.\nREEs aren't actually that rare and, in fact, are\u00a0as common as nickel or tin. The name refers to the fact they\u00a0aren't often concentrated in deposits that are profitable to develop.\nCanada is three decades behind China in developing the rare earth industry, Jones said, because 30 years ago, China saw the potential and dramatically increased production.\n\"This caused a steep decline in commodity price and effectively killed off any competition,\" he explained. \"So that's why they've had this monopoly.

CIBC (TSX:CM) is expected to lag the group because of its heavy reliance on domestic retail banking.\nSlowing loan growth with Canadians reluctant to add to already record debt levels and a cooling housing market combined with squeezed margins are expected to pressure the retail operations of the big banks.\nGareth Watson, vice-president of investment management and research at Richardson GMP, said earnings from capital markets and wealth management should provide for a \"decent quarter.\"\nIf retail earnings are better than expected, the banks even have a shot of beating analyst expectations, Watson said.\n\"There is only a limited number of ways for banks to claw money out of 35 million Canadians,\" said Watson.\n\"But in the past they've actually been pretty good at finding new ways to do it.\"\nIan Nakamoto, director of research at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, said he doesn't foresee any \"huge disappointments\" because expectations in the sector are already quite low.\nAnalyst Robert Sedran from CIBC World Markets said he expects earnings per share to decline by 2.5 per cent from the first quarter because of the fewer number of interest-earning days.\nBut year-over-year he predicts seven per cent growth.\n\"Profit growth for the Big Six may be slowing, but those same earnings streams remain resilient,\" Sedran said in a report.\n\"While these are not boom times for the Canadian banking sector, the recent share performance of the sector as a whole is in our view more pessimistic than fundamentals would suggest.\"\nAnalyst John Aiken at Barclays was more skeptical, predicting a four per cent decline from the first quarter.\n\"After a surprisingly strong first quarter, aided by incremental expense management and significant declines in provisions

A strong position in the mining sector helped make the exchange the sixth-largest in the world by market capitalization\u00a0\u2014 far larger than it probably should be, given Canada's domestic economy.\nBut that dominance has been eroding of late, as the venerable bourse is being attacked on all sides by new rivals for its core business.\nThe exchange's parent company, TMX Group Inc., essentially has three businesses:\nTMX Group\u00a0has always nominally competed with new entrants across each of its business units, but recently the upstarts have actually started to make a dent.\nSo-called \"alternative trading systems\" such as Omega, MATCH Now, Pure Trading, Instinet, Chi-X and most recently Alpha Group have popped up, with varying degrees of success. In some individual stocks, new players now make up more than 40 per cent of all Canadian trading activity.\nAlpha Group is proving to be the TSX's biggest threat. In February, the TSX's market share of all trading activity in Canada declined to 71.9 per cent. That sounds like a healthy margin, but the same time last year the figure stood at 93.1 per cent. Alpha has seen its share increase\u00a0 to 21\u00a0per cent\u00a0from 3.3 per cent over that same period.\nAlpha \u2014 formed in 2007 by the major Canadian banks and other large financial institutions \u2014 has been able to gobble up market share largely by slashing the fees it charges, something TMX belatedly followed suit with last month. The company estimates the customer-friendly move will cost it $15 million a year, but some say that's akin to closing the stable door after the horses have bolted.\nAt this point, Alpha has very little interaction with individual consumers. When a retail investor buys or sells a Canadian stock, the brokerage he or she uses makes the transaction and pays a fee to the trading firm responsible. That could be\u00a0Alpha, TMX, or one of the other players. The fee is theoretically passed on, but there's no direct link to individual investors.\nOn the listings side, after a tough year, a PricewaterhouseCoopers report found recently that money is returning to capital markets. Led by the $1.35-billion IPO of Athabasca Oil Sands, the total value of new issues in 2010 has already eclipsed 2009's recessionary total.\nWhich is why it could be bad news for TMX that Alpha is moving into the real golden goose, its listings business.\nOn April 22, Alpha filed papers with the Ontario Securities Commission to become a listing exchange\u00a0\u2014 in effect, a full competitor to the TSX on every level.\n\"We want to make a true level playing field,\" Alpha CEO Jos Schmitt says. \"Then competition will be fair between both parties.\"\nIf all goes well, Alpha hopes to end the near-monopoly status the TSX has enjoyed since it gobbled up smaller exchanges in Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary\u00a0and Vancouver to become Canada's only fully functional stock exchange. Major companies trade on the main market \u2014\u00a0reflected in the\u00a0S&P/TSX composite index\u00a0\u2014 while\u00a0smaller start-ups are typically listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, which TMX also owns.\nHaving multiple stock exchanges\u00a0would move Canada closer to the U.S. system, where as many as seven separate stock markets are available for listings, but the two New York-based titans, the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, dominate.\nThe TSX is doing anything but shy away from competition, to hear\u00a0chief executive\u00a0Tom Kloet tell it.\n\"We've faced competition before\u00a0\u2014 we already compete with major U.S. and international exchanges,\" he says.\u00a0\"The world is our marketplace. I think the multi-marketplace model is here to stay in this market and everywhere.\"\nStill, that doesn't mean TMX Group\u00a0is going to give up its virtual stranglehold without a fight.\nAlpha is owned in part by the investment arms of Canada's six largest banks, plus Canaccord Capital. Some say that having banks that do business on the exchanges\u00a0\u2014 and whose shares are\u00a0traded\u00a0on them\u00a0\u2014\u00a0owning an\u00a0actual exchange\u00a0presents an inherent conflict of interest.\nAlpha's Schmitt brushes off those concerns, noting that the individual banks' ownership in Alpha is too small to have a material impact. Nor would they have any incentive to flout the rules, given how dependent their core businesses are on having healthy equity markets.\nIndeed, the same conflict-of-interest concerns have been lobbed back at TMX. As Ilana Singer, associate director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Investor Rights, says: \"We think the rules in place today are fine, but FAIR has always had issues with the TSX being a listed company on its own exchange.\"\nHaving banks \"own\" the exchange is nothing new, since up until world stock exchanges began to go public themselves in the 2000s, they were typically member-owned entities, as is Alpha's current structure. TMX itself went public in 2000. When that happened, \"you have a big organization that is a monopoly, and then it becomes a for-profit organization,\" Schmitt counters, \"and that's a combination of two words that don't go well together.\"\u00a0\nFAIR supports the idea of a legitimate alternative to the TSX, but its main concerns are that the Ontario Securities Commission is clear about its motivations and requirements while judging Alpha's application, Singer says.\n\"We want to make sure that it's a transparent process,\" she says. \"This is a pretty big deal for investors and shareholders, so we want to make sure the requirements are robust\u00a0\u2014 if there are concerns, or any requirements that are less, we want a chance to comment.\"\n\"Competition is generally a good thing, but it's bad if it's a race to the bottom,\" Singer says.\nIt's a sentiment that TMX Group\u00a0echoes.\n\"When regulators designed the system for alternative trading systems, they held us to a different standard,\" Kevan Cowan, TMX's head of equities, told Bloomberg this month. \"They are absolutely not subject to the same scrutiny we are.\"\nFor its part, Alpha says it doesn't foresee any roadblocks\u00a0as it works with the OSC to ensure compliance. It's targeting a launch within this year, but even if it's successful, total competition between listings exchanges is unlikely to trickle down into savings for individual investors any time soon, Singer says.\n\"That certainly hasn't been the pitch, so I'm not sure it's a likely positive for consumers,\" she says.\n\"We have a 157-year history of delivering valuable listings to the marketplace,\" Kloet says, pouring cold water on the idea of some sort of price war if multiple exchanges\u00a0became the norm in Canada.\n\"Our investors trust us, so I'm very confident we'll continue to play the major role in Canada, and I'm very confident we can maintain our margins,\" he says.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Stocks climbing after strong reports from Facebook, GM", "description": "Stocks climb again Wednesday morning as investors applaud strong quarterly results", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/strong-reports-stock-climb-1.4885614", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4526507.1518112079!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/art-deco-doors-to-the-former-tsx-trading-floor.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Oct 31, 2018 11:00 AM ET", "2018-10-31T15:01:14.951Z"], "source": null, "content": "Stocks are climbing again Wednesday morning as investors applaud quarterly results from companies including Facebook, General Motors and Estee Lauder.\nAfter a rally a day earlier, the S&P 500 index is now on track for its first two-day winning streak since late September.

The Kospi in South Korea gained 0.7 per cent.\nStocks have plunged this month as Wall Street was frightened by numerous potential problems including rising interest rates and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Both could impair economic growth and company profits. Investors are that much more nervous because corporate profits are likely to fall off in 2019 after strong growth this year, a big portion of which stemmed from the one-time corporate tax cut.\nSome of the market's favourite stocks over the past decade have taken enormous losses.

Microsoft and Google's parent company Alphabet both dropped as well, while Apple only fell about as much as the rest of the market.\nBenchmark U.S. crude slipped 0.5 per cent to $65.87 US per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 0.5 per cent to $75.55 US per barrel in London.\nEnergy companies have lagged the market as U.S. crude has fallen 10 per cent this month.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bank profits may hint at economic slowdown", "description": "Earnings this week will provide a glimpse of Canada's prospects", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-profits-may-hint-at-economic-slowdown-1.1301241", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1582819.1381648052!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-tsx-scotia.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2013 10:05 AM ET", "2013-02-25T17:18:13.000Z"], "source": null, "content": "Canada's biggest banks are likely headed into a challenging year as consumer lending growth slows alongside persistent economic weakness, analysts suggest.\nThe combination could provide a dark lining to what are expected to be good earnings results for the first quarter when most banks report starting this week. But it will also set the stage for a cautious remainder of the year.\nAnalysts expect most of the big banks will increase their dividends in the period.\nMuch of the concern lies in the domestic retail banking operations, the side of the business dedicated to consumers, which has fared well in recent years. The division could weigh heavy on the banks' overall growth, as Canadians face record-high debt levels and the housing market comes off its highs.\n\"It's just a matter of the magnitude of (the consumer lending) decline and what it means for the underlying financials,\" said Tom Lewandowski, financial services analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.\nHe said the focus will be on whether the banks are able to offset the decline through other lending venues to businesses.\nLast month, Royal Bank chief executive Gord Nixon said the bank was experiencing a weakness in mortgage lending due to the slowdown in the real estate market. He said that while he expects the country's housing market to remain solid, lending would likely slow to mid single digits.\nBank of Montreal will be the first to report its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Consensus expectations are for earnings per share of $1.47 and $3.88 billion in revenue, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.\nOn Thursday, Royal Bank is expected to post earnings per share of $1.32 with revenues of $7.6 billion. TD Bank expectations are for $1.93 earnings per share and revenue of $6 billion.\nBoth CIBC and National Bank will be closely watched because they rely most on their domestic banking operations which could make them especially vulnerable to the slowdown.\nBarclays analyst John Aiken downgraded both of those banks, with National falling from overweight to equal weight, while CIBC has been dropped to underweight from equal weight with a stock price target of $81.\nCIBC, which also reports Thursday, has expectations for earnings of $2.08 per share and $3.22 billion in revenue by analysts.\nAnd National Bank is expected to have $2.01 per share of earnings and $1.28 billion in revenue.\n\"We favour the banks that have smaller contributions from domestic retail net interest income and have greater exposure to capital markets,\" Aiken wrote in a note.\nIf domestic retail banking slows, Scotiabank, BMO, and Royal Bank are the least sensitive, Aiken said.\nThe last to report is Scotiabank, on March 5, which is expected to earn $1.26 per share and $5.04 billion revenue.\nAll of the major banks are expected to increase their dividends, with the exception of National Bank and BMO.\nBank earnings are closely watched during the first quarter because executives tend to offer a firm outlook for the coming year, which can help analysts determine if more trouble is afoot.\n\"Maintaining the trajectory of growth momentum is going to get more and more challenging, it's as simple as that,\" said Brad Smith, senior financial services analyst at Stonecap Securities.\nHe also suggested that a slowdown in domestic operations could play out over a longer period of time.\n\"I think people will come out of the quarter going 'It really hasn't slowed as much as I thought it was going to slow,\"' he said.\n\"We always imagine things will happen more quickly than they do.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Roger Fowler Peterborough", "description": null, "url":

Thus, the certificates of the companies that constituted the index have been changing hands at a greater pace than, say, late 2009.\nBack then, the volume underscoring the TSX Shariah index hovered in the 20-to-30-million share range.\nLikewise, the value of the index has risen about 25 per cent by the end of December 2009 versus the measure\u2019s year low.\nOf course, trading in the underlying shares might not indicate the relative popularity of an index.\nIndeed, some industry watchers dispute whether the Shariah benchmark has picked up in acceptance.\n\"This index has been very quiet,\" said Jeff Gareau, a financial advisor with No Interest Investments, a Mississauga, Ont.-based financial company specializing in investing according to Islamic criteria.\nStill, after a couple of years, the TSX Shariah index remains one of the most interesting vehicles for measuring one\u2019s investments.\nIn order to become compliant with Islamic religious code, the TSX's new index\u00a0\u2014 the S&P/TSX 60 Shariah\u00a0\u2014 excludes companies that engage in activities prohibited by that religion, such as gambling and adult entertainment. Companies involved in the production of such products as liquor, tobacco and pork are also excluded from the religious index.\nThere are 25 stocks in the Canadian Shariah index, including drug maker Biovail Corp. and cheese producer Saputo Inc.\nTo be compliant with Islamic law, qualified investments cannot generate significant profits from interest-generating activities, they must be conservative in their financing activities and they cannot be made in certain prohibited industries, according to Gareau.\nThus, people looking to put their money into Shariah-qualified equities must generally avoid firms that are engaged in the following sectors:\nThe last category usually prevents Muslim investors from holding stocks in banks and other financial service firms that rely upon lending money for the majority of their earnings.\nIn addition, Islamic law prevents believers from putting money into companies that are financed in a risky manner. Under this provision, companies need to have:\nThe S&P/TSX Shariah 60 index is designed to give Islamic investors, especially ones in other countries, a way of comparing how Shariah-compliant investments in Canada would fare versus Shariah stocks in other countries, or compared to the general TSX index, said\u00a0Alka Banerjee, vice-president of global equity in Standard & Poor's index division.\n\"The new index will create new opportunities for Islamic investors to benchmark their Canadian investments, and for asset managers to create new investment products serving the Islamic community,\" she said in a company statement at the time of the index's launch.\nIslamic-compliant investments receive the same tax treatment as equities in other indices, according to\u00a0Gareau.\n\"They are treated no differently than conventional investments,\" he said, so they can be held in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) or registered education saving plan (RESP).\nWhile Standard and Poor's does not produce any other indices based upon religious rules, other faiths have designed their own investment vehicles.\nIn December, U.S.-based FaithShares Advisers LLC launched a trio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) targeting Christians, including a fund specifically for Lutherans and another for Baptists.\n\"Each of our funds will include 100 stocks of large, well-known companies, but specifically exclude those considered to be objectionable industries by a specific denomination,\" said Thompson Phillips, president of Oklahoma City-based FaithShares.\nAmong the ETFs holdings are Starbucks Corp., retailer Nordstrom Inc. and Motorola Inc.\nWhile these types of indices and mutual funds might make the faithful happy, some analysts have questioned whether they can deliver solid portfolio returns.\nSpecifically, one criticism of religion-based indices and mutual funds is that they restrict the potential stock issues that can be held, and thus lower the portfolio's possible return while boosting its volatility. Exposure to a wider range of stocks can help soften market swings that hit specific sectors\u00a0\u2014 in larger indices, each stock makes up a smaller portion of the index. Hence, the price movement of any one stock will move the overall index a smaller amount than it would in an index with fewer stocks. That is why stock professionals watch the S&P 500 index to get a measure of market trends.\nAnother factor that potentially compounds this problem for Shariah investors is the fact that Islam prohibits involvement with firms that profit by lending money and receiving interest payments. Thus, the S&P/TSX 60 Shariah index does not count shares in Canada's well-considered banking sector, which is traditionally less volatile holdings that can act to reduce stock swings due to changes in world commodity prices.\nDespite these criticisms, in practice Canada's Shariah index tends to mirror the TSX's overall results.\nOverall, the smaller Canadian Shariah index movements tracked the TSX's overall changes almost exactly during 2009, Banerjee said. Its return was also just marginally behind that of S&P's global equity index.\n\"In general, the Shariah index follows the overall index very closely,\" she said.\nNo Interest's Gareau agreed, noting that for his company's Shariah funds, \"We only consider the top 100 liquid stocks throughout the world. This actually makes the fund less volatile than even some of the core equity funds that utilize banks.\"\nIn the end, Canada's Shariah index is there because investors wanted it, Banerjee said. \"We're completely agnostic as to the politics at-hand. [The index] was not driven by catering to one group over another. There was simply a strong demand for this.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canaccord closes half its offices", "description": "Financial firm will have 16 locations and 180 advisory teams left", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canaccord-closes-half-its-offices-1.1251294", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Sep 24, 2012 9:14 AM ET", "2012-09-24T16:49:37.000Z"], "source": null, "content": "Wealth management firm Canaccord Financial Inc. is closing 16 branches across the country and reducing the number of advisors at the remaining Canadian locations, which will be concentrated in major cities.\nThe move will cut the number of Canaccord offices by half, with 16 remaining.

The growth exceeded management forecasts and analyst projections. Netflix's stock increased 2 per cent in extended trading, putting it on track to touch new highs Tuesday. The shares have increased by about five-fold during the past four years.\nBut Netflix's subscriber growth could slow if it can't continue to win programming rights to hit TV series and movies, now that there are more competitors, including Apple , Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.\nIf that happens, there will be more attention on Netflix's huge programming bills, and \"then we could see an investor backlash,\" CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi says. \"But Netflix has been delivering great subscriber growth so far.\"\nNetflix's long-term debt and other obligations totalled $21.9 billion US as of Sept. 30, up from $16.8 billion at the same time last year. That includes $17 billion for video programming during the next five years, up from $14.4 billion a year ago.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company has to borrow to pay for most of its programming expenses because it doesn't generate enough cash on its own. Netflix burned through another $465 million in the most recent quarter, which is known as \"negative cash flow\" in accounting parlance.\nFor all of this year, Netflix has warned that its negative cash flow might be as high as $2.5 billion, a trend that management expects will continue for at least the next several years as its service tries to diversify its video library to appeal to the divergent tastes in about 190 countries.\nDespite the huge cash outflow, Netflix has remained profitable, under U.S. accounting rules. The company earned $130 million on $3 billion in revenue in its latest quarter.\nBut the price increases could backfire if it provokes an unusually high number of subscribers to cancel, something Netflix faced when it raised rates in the past. Most analysts believe that's unlikely to happen this time, and Netflix supported that thesis with its growth forecast for the current quarter. Management expects to add 6.3 million subscribers during the October-December period, slightly more than what analysts are anticipating, according to FactSet.\nNetflix has long argued its borrowing makes sense to gain a huge advantage over rivals as people increasingly watch programming on internet-connected devices. Plus, management points out that its total debt is small compared with its market value of nearly $90 billion.\nWith such a valuable stock, Netflix theoretically could sell more shares to raise money \u2014 similar to how homeowners sometimes use the equity accrued in their houses to pay big bills.\nBut that would be more difficult to do if Netflix's stock price plummets amid concerns about its debt.\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also questions the long-term value of Netflix's programming line-up.\n\"What is something like Season One of House of Cards worth to you if you already have watched it? It's probably only worth something to someone who hasn't been subscribing to Netflix for the past five years,\" Pachter says. \"So that means Netflix has to keep reinventing itself virtually every year, and that costs money.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "TSX tumbles 284 points as investors bail out of banks, energy", "description": "Falling oil prices and disappointing bank earnings hurt Toronto market's biggest sectors", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tsx-tumbles-284-points-as-investors-bail-out-of-banks-energy-1.2860958", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2860989.1417731868!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/dollar-markets-20141125.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 04, 2014 5:26 PM ET", "2014-12-04T22:26:13.858Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Toronto stock market tumbled nearly two per cent in a broad sell-off that hit financial and energy stocks particularly hard.\n\n\n\nEnergy stocks dropped 4.1 per cent as the January crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 67 cents to $66.76 US.\n\nOil was hammered by news that Saudi Arabia had reduced January prices to U.S. and Asian customers and was anticipating oil prices could go as low as $60 a barrel.\n\n\nFinancial stocks fell after TD Bank\u00a0released a disappointing earnings report.

Scientists have found something they didn't think existed: an animal that can't breathe oxygen, and obviously doesn't need to. That animal is a parasite called Henneguya salminocola, distantly related to jellyfish. It lives in the muscles of salmon and trout, causing unsightly little white nodules known as \"tapioca disease.\" The parasite has just 10 cells and is smaller than many of the cells in our bodies, but it has the ability to live without the machinery to turn oxygen into energy, researchers say.

Scientists have found something they didn't think existed: an animal that can't breathe oxygen, and obviously doesn't need to. That animal is a parasite called Henneguya salminocola, distantly related to jellyfish. It lives in the muscles of salmon and trout, causing unsightly little white nodules known as \"tapioca disease.\" The parasite has just 10 cells and is smaller than many of the cells in our bodies, but it has the ability to live without the machinery to turn oxygen into energy, researchers say.

(TSX:ENB), a major Canadian oil and natural gas pipeline company, is heading a group of 19 energy industry players in a project that will inject their carbon dioxide emissions into underground saltwater pools.\nThe Alberta saline aquifer project, or ASAP, will be the first of its kind in Canada, the Calgary-based company said Monday.\n\"The oil and gas that is the source of these carbon emissions came from deep underground and essentially we're putting it back from where it originated,\" Chuck Szmurlo, Enbridge's vice-president of energy technology, said in an interview.\nThe Alberta government and many in the oilpatch have been lauding carbon capture and storage as an effective way to deal with the massive amounts of greenhouse gases emitted by the industry.\n\"Sequestration is widely considered to be one of the most meaningful ways that Canada and Alberta can reduce overall emissions,\" Patrick Daniel, Enbridge's president and chief executive, said in a statement.\nBut some have questioned the economics of such projects, since they're costly to build and storing the gas doesn't generate revenue in itself.\n\"It's not a trivial proposition,\" Szmurlo said.\n\"What would generate the economics of this is ultimately the value society places on not having carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\"\nThe companies involved in the project could turn a profit if provincial or federal governments ever decided to give financial incentives for each tonne of carbon dioxide pumped underground.\nThe first study phase of ASAP is expected to cost\u00a0about $750,000. The participants are conducting a study to find good spots to get the project started.\nThe\u00a0cost of a small-scale pilot project that will process about 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a day would be about $20 million to $30 million. Bringing it to the commercial level will cost \"in excess\" of $200 million, Szmurlo said.\nThat's a far cry from the $2 billion put forth last week by provincial federal taskforce on carbon capture and storage, chaired by TransAlta Corp. (TSX:TA) chief executive Steve Snyder.\nTransAlta and more than a dozen other companies, including Imperial Oil Ltd. (TSX:IMO) and Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX:SU), are part of another carbon capture consortium called the Integrated CO2 network, or ICON.\nICON wants to set up a\u00a0national system that would capture emissions from a number of industrial sites and move them underground via pipeline. Under that plan, the carbon dioxide could be kept in depleted oil and gas reserves, deep and unminable coal formations or in deep saline aquifers, like in ASAP.\nThe ASAP study phase is underway and expected to wrap up at the end of the year.\n\"If we get the funding in place and the permitting goes as we hope it will, we're hopeful that this time next year we'll be turning some dirt,\" Szmurlo said.\nThe naturally occurring aquifers look a lot like oil and gas reservoirs, but instead hold saltwater. Until now, the oil and gas industry had no use for them.\n\"We don't really go looking for them, but you discover them in the course of doing exploration work for oil and gas,\" Szmurlo said.\nThe carbon dioxide will be injected into the pools in the \"reverse way\" oil and gas is normally pumped out, he explained.\n\"Eventually the carbon dioxide will be absorbed into them and they'll be kind of like a carbonated salt water,\" Szmurlo said.\nEpcor Utilities Inc. (TSX:EP.UN), which builds, owns and operates power plants, and electrical transmission and distribution networks in Canada and the U.S., is a founding member of ASAP.\nOther participants include, ATCO Power Canada Ltd.

The index recategorizes equities on the S&P/TSX 60 and excludes all equities that do not comply with Islamic law, which is based on the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an.\u00a0\nWhile sometimes there's the impression that there are few strong Shariah-compliant investment products, Khalid says there are many \"wonderful companies\" that can help investors reap big dividends, including technology companies.\n\"Absolutely nothing is holding them back,\" he says.\u00a0\"If they don\u2019t [invest], obviously they\u2019re losing something big time.

All were given extra years to meet reductions that should have been done by now.\n\"It's tougher than they thought,\" Terry Abel of the Energy Resources Conservation Board said Tuesday. \"It's tougher than we thought, too.\"\nTailings are the toxic byproducts of extracting bitumen, which is then upgraded into synthetic crude. Tailings are contained in large man-made lakes, and their impact on the environment has become a lightning rod for critics of the oilsands industry.\nReclaiming mine tailings has been one of the oilsands\u00a0industry's major environmental challenges. Much of that waste material is composed of particles so fine they take years or even decades to settle out of tailings ponds. Without a way to hasten the process, oilsands tailings ponds have grown from 50 square kilometres in 2006 to 176 square kilometres today.\nIn 2009, the board released regulations that were developed in consultation with industry and were designed to force energy companies to produce fewer tailings. By this year, operators were supposed to be removing at least half of those fine particles from their waste water and storing them so that they'd be firm enough to support a vehicle within a year.\nBut a recent report, which covers up to the end of 2012, found that none of the four licensed operators that so far come under the regulation was on track to meet that goal.\nSuncor (TSX:SU), which was supposed to be removing 30 per cent of its particles, was capturing 8.5 per cent of them. Syncrude's (TSX:COS, TSX:SU, TSX:IMO) Mildred Lake project was removing 8.8 per cent of the 12 per cent required.\nShell's (NYSE:RDS) Muskeg River and Jackpine projects, on the hook for 23.5 and 15.5 per cent removals, respectively, were at 8.8 per cent and zero.\nFive other oilsands licensees are either not yet producing or haven't been producing long enough to be required to report their removals.\nThe energy conservation board has given most operators, including those who aren't yet reporting, until the end of 2015 to meet the 50 per cent guideline.\nSome, such as Imperial Oil's (TSX:IMO) Kearl and Shell's Muskeg River projects, have until 2016. Canadian Natural Resouces Ltd.(TSX:CNQ) gets until 2017.\nNew, unproven technologies just aren't up to speed yet, said Abel.\nSome operators, such as Suncor, hoped to dry thin layers of tailings in the sun but have found the weather unco-operative.\n\"(Our system) is still a relatively new technology in the early stages of development and commercialization,\" said spokeswoman Sneh Setal. \"Since the first trial back in 2008, we've learned a great deal about the practical challenges of implementing (it) on a commercial scale.\"\nCompanies have promised to catch up by removing a higher percentage of particles in future years. But the board notes that the longer the wait, the harder the catch-up.\n\"Delaying the previously approved annual fines capture will make achieving the required cumulative fines capture in later years much more difficult,\" says its analysis of the plan from Canadian Natural Resources.\nNo enforcement has been taken against any of the companies. Abel said operators have been working hard to meet the goals, collaborating on best practices and spending billions on tailings reductions.\n\"The big issue is that despite all of those efforts, they're running into problems making that work within those complex operations,\" Abel said. \"We found that both they and ourselves were probably aggressive in setting those targets and believing we could get those performances as quickly as we were hoping.\"\nEnforcement is a possibility if operators still aren't meeting their goals after the next report, expected in two years.\n\"We fully expect ... if they don't make progress on those operations, we'll take action against them in the future,\" said Abel.\nThat's not good enough, said Jennifer Grant of the Pembina Institute, a think tank focused on developing innovative sustainable energy solutions.\nShe points out that the board had already allowed operators some flexibility on deadlines, even though regulations were written with industry input.\n\"There's been a real shift in terms of that original thinking and what we're seeing today.\"\nGrant suggested there are many new tailings technologies available and answers are probably nearer than industry suggests.\n\"I don't think addressing tailings is an insurmountable technical challenge. Operators could meet the tailings directive. It's really a question of whether they'll be forced to.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oil price collapse means lower gas prices for motorists", "description": "TSX and dollar down as global energy prices plunge", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-price-collapse-means-lower-gas-prices-for-motorists-1.2853565", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2799348.1413817314!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/gas-prices.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Nov 28, 2014 10:56 AM ET", "2014-11-28T22:44:31.572Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "A collapse in world oil prices will mean\u00a0good news for Canadian motorists heading into the Christmas season, with one petroleum analyst saying gas prices will plummet this weekend.\nOil prices have dropped about 35 per cent from mid-summer highs because of a higher U.S. dollar, lower demand and most particularly a glut of global supply.\nWhile the price drop has led to losses on the Toronto stock market and concerns for provincial budgets in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, it's forecast to bring relief\u00a0to\u00a0Canadians filling up at gas stations.\nDan\u00a0McTeague, a former Liberal MP and founder of price-tracking and forecasting website TomorrowsGasPriceToday.com, said oil prices tend to suggest where gasoline is going to go, often within 48 hours.

ensuring\u00a0the\u00a0products they rely on for their retirement income\u00a0comply with Islamic principles.\nWith nearly a million Muslims in Canada, forming nearly three per cent of the country's population, there has been an emphasis over the last decade in investment products that adhere to the strict dictates of Shariah law.\nSo-called Shariah-compliant investments have been growing in popularity, due in part to investor interest in working with the Middle East as oil prices continue to rise.\nThe key elements of Islamic investing are the avoidance of interest, or Riba, and that investment products have no ties to:\nThe deadline for registered retirement savings plan\u00a0contributions that can be claimed for the 2011 tax return year is midnight Wednesday\u00a0night.\nAs a devout Muslim, Mohammad Khalid, a retired economist living in Oakville, Ont., says Muslims must be careful about their investments, such as securities and equities.\nKhalid,\u00a0who manages his own portfolio, invests in sectors such as mining, forestry and technology, and is helping his older children save for their retirement. He\u00a0says that\u00a0unless Muslim investors are careful about where their money is going, they could end up\u00a0in non-compliant products.\u00a0\n\"The way I actually look at Shariah-compliant products is mainly as a subset\u00a0of ethical, or socially responsible investing [such as avoiding the adult entertainment industry or any company that may negatively impact the environment],\" he told CBC economics correspondent Mike Hornbrook.\nAre you contributing this year?\u00a0Take our survey.\n\"The whole market is essentially available, excluding some of the major ones [such as insurance companies and banks]. ...There are so many different companies which which will keep giving you dividends year after year.\"\nRehan Huda, a director with Amana Canada Holdings, a niche financial firm that sells Shariah-compliant investment funds,\u00a0says\u00a0Islam prohibits explicit loan contracts where you just lend someone money\u00a0and they pay it back with interest,\u00a0so that means investing in bank or insurance company stock, or in bonds of any sort that generate interest, is not allowed.\nHuda's Shariah-compliant funds are focused on mining, forestry and technology.\n\"We've assisted in getting the Shariah-compliant certification for a couple of the mutual funds that are in Canada right now,\" he says.\u00a0\"There\u2019s one fund \u2013 a bullion fund \u2013 that\u2019s a fairly large fund that has gold, silver, platinum stored here, and it\u2019s a purely Shariah-compliant fund.\n\n\"Since we're heavily in resource and technology-weighted [funds] ... when those do well,\u00a0the Shariah funds generally do well.\"\nHuda says that\u00a0as\u00a0Muslims make up a growing proportion of Canada's population,\u00a0the demand for Shariah-compliant investments will only grow. \u00a0\n\"An inordinate amount of cash is found among\u00a0Muslim investors that I know ... and they are waiting for Shariah-compliant\u00a0products,\" he says.\n\"In the future, there\u2019s going to be a lot more products because the population is increasing here.\"\nA testament to the growing\u00a0interest in\u00a0Shariah-compliant investing is Standard & Poor\u2019s introduction of\u00a0its Shariah stock index (S&P/TSX 60 Shariah Index) into the Canadian market in 2009. The index recategorizes equities on the S&P/TSX 60 and excludes all equities that do not comply with Islamic law, which is based on the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an.\u00a0\nWhile sometimes there's the impression that there are few strong Shariah-compliant investment products, Khalid says there are many \"wonderful companies\" that can help investors reap big dividends, including technology companies.\n\"Absolutely nothing is holding them back,\" he says.\u00a0\"If they don\u2019t [invest], obviously they\u2019re losing something big time.

"source": "CBC News", "content": "After 2016, a year of\u00a0ups and downs for the Canadian\u00a0economy, there's a growing body of evidence suggesting 2017 will be a better year.\nHere are five\u00a0big reasons\u00a0the economy could\u00a0do a lot better than you might think this year.\nIt may be cold comfort to anyone still looking for work, but Canada's job market ended 2016 on a bit of a\u00a0tear, adding more than 200,000 jobs from August onwards.\u00a0There were more than 50,000 new jobs in December alone.\u00a0\nOn\u00a0the whole,\u00a0there were more part-time jobs created in 2016 than full-time ones, but\u00a0one big bank economist says it may be time to give up the notion\u00a0that such jobs are somehow less desirable.\u00a0\n\"The consensus has been far too bearish on Canadian job growth for months now,\" Scotiabank economist Derek Holt says. \"Yes, last year was the year of the part-time employee, but guess what \u2014 the workforce has been changing for years and not everyone wants the alarm clock buzzing at 4:30 a.m. every day.\"\nIt's always good to take volatile monthly figures with a grain of salt. But even ignoring the positive headline figures, the latest numbers show that wages are up, and so is the percentage of working-age adults who are choosing to be in the labour force. That's good news no matter how you slice it.\n\"The job data is the first available for taking stock of 2016,\" Desjardins economist Jo\u00eblle\u00a0Noreau\u00a0says, \"and the data is good.\"\nCanada's economy is intrinsically linked to the price of oil, which is a big part of what made 2015 and 2016 such a bumpy ride. From a high of over $100 US a barrel in late 2014, oil bottomed out at under $30 US a barrel last year, wiping out billions from the stock market \u2014 not to mention tens of\u00a0thousands of oilpatch\u00a0jobs in the process.\nBut ever since last fall, crude has been on a steady, albeit slow, march higher, up $10 a barrel in the past month. The main reason is that the byzantine\u00a0oil cartel known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) lurched back to life with a pledge to start turning off the spigots to get prices back to a level member countries are\u00a0more comfortable with.\nThat move might actually be working.\nSaudi Arabia has been pumping out 486,000 fewer barrels a day since October, and more and more countries are following suit. While OPEC nations compete with Canadian oil companies for market share, the latter are the unwitting beneficiaries of their rivals' action.\nIf OPEC's gambit works, 2017 could be much better for oil prices \u2014\u00a0and Canada's economy by association.\nIt's not hard to come up with arguments explaining\u00a0why the Canadian dollar could be in for a rough 2017. Here are\u00a0two\u00a0arguments\u00a0we've brought you\u00a0in the past two months alone:\nCanadian dollar may go as low as 70 cents US in 2017, experts say\nDollar could drop to 65 cents US in 2017, Macquarie forecasts\nWhile those forecasts still hold up, at least one expert says those predictions are far too bleak \u2014 and\u00a0he has\u00a0a\u00a0solid track record of being right.\nHe may not be a household name, but\u00a0Konrad\u00a0Bialas, chief economist at foreign-exchange broker Dom Maklerski in Warsaw, is the top-ranked forecaster when it comes to the Canadian dollar, according to Bloomberg's\u00a0accuracy gauge.\nBialas says the doom and gloom around the loonie is misguided, as Canada's economy has been through the eye of the storm and is poised to grow. Believe it or not, the loonie was one of the best performing major currencies in the world last year, trouncing the yen, the franc, the euro and the pound.\n\"The beginning of the year could be difficult for the Canadian dollar, but we're expecting the trend to start slowing down,\" Bialas told Bloomberg this week, suggesting the loonie could end the year even higher than it is now, hovering around the 75-cent level.\n\"The Canadian economy will feel the positive effects of an acceleration of growth worldwide and the risks to trade with the U.S. \u2014\u00a0the worries over tearing down NAFTA\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will drop,\" he said.\nThere's ample evidence that the trade winds are blowing, too.\u00a0On Friday, Statistics Canada reported\u00a0that Canada swung to a trade surplus for the first time in two years in November, as the economy exported\u00a0$526 million more than it imported that month.\nEverything from energy products, to potash, aerospace parts and\u00a0canola\u00a0was booming, an encouraging sign of broad and diverse strength.\n\n\"That is somewhat reassuring and suggests that, following the dip ...\u00a0 in October, the economy enjoyed a decent rebound in November,\" economist Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said.\n\nIn the markets, the TSX came within a few points of its all-time high of\u00a015,685 points this week,\u00a0set back in September 2014 \u2014\u00a0before oil's decline waylaid the market.\nAs economic indicators go, the TSX is far from perfect. But an all-time high for a country's dominant stock index is the sort of thing that tends to draw attention. Witness the hubbub in the U.S. right now over the Dow Jones, which has been flirting with passing the 20,000 point level for the first time for about a month now.\nThe TSX fell just short of its all-time high\u00a0mark this week, but strategist Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets in Toronto says there's every reason to think it could pass that mark soon.\n\"Canadian investors should remain cautiously optimistic,\" he said in an interview with CBC News this week. \"With commodities'\u00a0prices increasing and gold recovering from its big takedown, that should help resources and create a tailwind,\" and blow a little more money into all Canadian investors' pockets.\nConsidering the slew of positive financial news,\u00a0a surging TSX seems downright reasonable.\nAs BMO's\u00a0Doug Porter put it this week, \"this run of sturdy figures provided a nice antidote to a sour end to last year's data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Brookfield to privatize BPO Properties", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/brookfield-to-privatize-bpo-properties-1.384625", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Apr 28, 2003 5:19 PM ET", "2003-04-28T21:19:54.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Brookfield Properties Corp.(TSX:BPO)announced plans on Monday buy out the minority shareholders of its Canadian real estate investment company, BPO Properties Ltd.(TSX:BPP), for $86.7 million. \nBrookfield already owns about 90 per cent of the equity in BPO. \nBrookfield said it will offer $13 in cash plus one-half of a common shares for each BPO share.

first reported on Thursday that even after recreational marijuana use becomes legal in Canada next month, the U.S. will continue to enforce rules concerning travel relating to the drug, which will continue to be a banned substance at the federal level even though numerous states have legalized it.\n\"If you work for the industry, that is grounds for inadmissibility,\"\u00a0Todd Owen of\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told Politico, adding that investors in cannabis from other countries have already been denied entry.\n\"Facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada may affect an individual's admissibility to the U.S.,\" Owen was quoted as saying.\nThose who admit to using marijuana are likely to have the same level of scrutiny as before, but the report late Thursday suggested that the consequences may soon extend to those who work and invest in companies involved in the legal industry in Canada.\n\"As marijuana remains federally prohibited in the U.S., working or having involvement in the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal or Canada\u00a0may affect\u00a0an individual's admissibility to the U.S.,\" CBP told CBC News in a statement.\nAnd lying to a border agent is itself enough to earn a lifetime ban, the agency says.\nAnnamaria\u00a0Enenajor, a criminal lawyer and executive director of the Campaign for Cannabis Amnesty, said Friday that serious consequences are indeed something anyone crossing the border needs to know about.\n\"If you have investments in cannabis companies, even companies that are publicly traded, that could raise flags,\" she said in an interview Friday.\nWhile she says she doesn't expect border officials will start asking detailed questions on marijuana investments of everyone crossing the border, \"if you're stopped at the border and you face questions about your involvement with cannabis, and you answer those questions in the positive, you can face a lifetime ban,\" she said.\nBill Blair, the minister of border security and organized crime reduction, told CBC\u00a0News that although, \"possession of cannabis is legal in some U.S. states, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law\" and Canadians travelling there need to respect U.S. laws.\u00a0\nHe also warned that the U.S. has the right to set its own laws and that staff at the border are not amending their procedures to reflect the legalization of cannabis in Canada.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Canadians who wish to enter the United States or any other country have to adhere to its laws.\nThe CBP\u00a0statement suggests enforcement agencies will consider Canadians crossing the border on a case-by-case basis.\n\"CBP\u00a0officers are thoroughly trained on admissibility factors and the Immigration and Nationality Act which broadly governs the admissibility of travellers into the United States,\" the agency said.\u00a0\"Determinations about admissibility are made on a case-by-case basis by a\u00a0CBP\u00a0officer based on the facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time.\"\nBut there's much uncertainty as to how far the concept of \"involvement\" the marijuana industry extends. Canadian\u00a0Sam Znaimer was recently turned away and banned for life at a crossing in Washington state because one of his many business ventures is investment in\u00a0U.S.\u00a0cannabis companies.\nHis lawyer, Len Saunders, said Friday that the agency's latest comments came as a surprise to him since he had assumed the government would take a \"hands off\" approach to the drug once it was legal in Canada.\n\"Going forward, anybody involved in any cannabis industry, regardless of where it's located, regardless of whether or not it's legal in that state, province our country will be deemed inadmissible to the U.S.,\" Saunders said, adding that the news will have a \"chilling effect\" on legal businesses in Canada.\n\"Whether it's people who are just front-line workers, or investors, or running cannabis companies,\" he said, \"if they find out you're involved, it's going to create a huge impediment on cross-border business and people.\"\nAnyone hit with a ban can apply for a waiver to exempt themselves, which can be a costly and lengthy process. But if they plan to continue to be involved in the cannabis industry, there's no point anyway, Saunders says.\n\"If you get it approved and you're still involved in that industry, there's a very good chance you'll get it taken away,\" he said.\nIt's not immediately clear what level of involvement would constitute ownership in a marijuana company.\nThe three most active shares on the TSX\u00a0on Friday were marijuana companies.\u00a0The most active, Aurora Cannabis, saw\u00a0more than 14\u00a0million shares change hands in the first hour of trading\u00a0\u2014 more shares than were traded in all five big banks, and Rogers, Bell, Telus and Suncor put together.\nAs members of the main TSX index, marijuana companies such as Canopy Growth, Aphria, Aurora Cannabis and others are included in hundreds of mutual funds and ETFs, which means owners of those funds are technically investors in marijuana, too.\nShares in all those companies seesawed on Friday as gloom set in over the sector. All the big names plunged at open, before recovering later in the morning.\nThe two biggest pot companies \u2014 Canopy Growth and Aurora \u2014 saw their shares fall 14 and nine per cent, respectively, on Thursday, the day\u00a0the Politico report came out.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "CI Financial bids for Rockwater Capital", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ci-financial-bids-for-rockwater-capital-1.679211", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Feb 12, 2007 11:14 AM ET", "2007-02-12T21:08:57.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "CI Financial Income Fund on Mondayannounced a $251-million friendly takeover bid for financial services company Rockwater Capital Corp.\nCI, which has about $82.9 billion in assets, said it will offer $7.65 per share for Rockwater through a combination of cash and trust units.\nShares of Toronto-based Rockwater rose 18 cents to close at $7.58 on the TSX.\nRockwater's holdings include KBSH Capital management, an investment management and portfolio consulting firm, Lakeview Asset Management, a retail investment management company, and Blackmont Capital, a full-service investment dealer.\nRockwater's board of directorsis recommending that shareholders accept the deal.\n\"The acquisition of Rockwater continues our strategy of expanding CI's distribution capabilities and building increased scale in our asset management business,\" William Holland, CI's chief executive officer, said in a release.\nUnits of CI were up 20 cents at $26.30 on the TSX.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Canadian dollar plunges to 5-year low as oil dips below $60", "description": "TSX bounces up from Thursday's steep drop", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-dollar-plunges-to-5-year-low-as-oil-dips-below-60-1.2869946", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2782833.1412101455!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/loonie-20140915.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 11, 2014 12:57 PM ET", "2014-12-11T22:19:48.143Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The Canadian dollar plunged to below 87\u00a0cents US today\u00a0in the wake of turmoil in oil and stock markets.\nThe loonie was trading at a 5\u00bd-year low of 86.72 cents US, down 0.39 of a cent.\nAfter oil gained earlier in the day, it sank again in the afternoon, ending the day below $60, its lowest level since 2009.

Its 110,000-bpd first phase has been producing bitumen since spring 2013 and first oil at its expansion project was achieved in mid-2015.\nIn a news release, Imperial blamed the Kearl results on \"planned and unplanned maintenance activities,\" without giving details.\nSpokeswoman Killeen Kelly said in an email the maintenance was designed \"to optimize operations\" at Kearl, but didn't provide details either or answer whether production continues to be impaired.\n\"We have reservations about Kearl continuously achieving run-rate capacity of about 220,000 bpd in 2017 and believe further small-scale investment may be required to consistently achieve capacity,\" wrote CIBC analyst Arthur Grayfer in a note to investors.\nThe drop in Kearl production was offset by better-than-expected results from the 40-year-old Syncrude oilsands mining project, which matched its best-ever quarterly performance with near-nameplate production of 350,000 bpd versus about 255,000 bpd in the year-earlier period.\nImperial, which operates Syncrude, earned 87,000 bpd from its 25 per cent stake, up from 64,000 bpd a year ago.\nAnalysts said the results bode well for Suncor Energy Inc.

Canada won't reach one third of its households only having cellphone service until 2016, Eiley said.\nHowever, the new wireless companies have undercut Rogers, Bell and Telus by more than 58 per cent on combined voice and data plans and by more than 83 per cent on data alone.\nData plans allow consumers to do things such as stream music, watch video and check email and social networks.\nThe study also estimated that new wireless players like Wind Mobile, Mobilicity and Public Mobile will have four million or 12 per cent of Canadian subscribers by the end of 2014, up five per cent from year-end 2011.\nBut Eiley expects that only one of the three new wireless carriers will be left standing by 2014. That's expected to mean that Shaw Communications (TSX:SJB.B) will buy up coveted high-value wireless spectrum in the next auction of radio waves and enter the mobile phone market around that time, he said.\n\"At that point, whoever is left can start raising their prices because they don't have to worry about the competition,\" he said, adding that Shaw is simply on the sidelines for now.\n\"Shaw is not out.

The company has been\u00a0developing a $1.5-billion potash mine and processing facility\u00a0in the West African country for several years.\nSearch warrant materials obtained by CBC News tell a cautionary tale about the company, which is registered in Toronto but controlled by Chinese interests since a takeover in 2011.\u00a0Those investors and managers are now ensnared\u00a0in an international police bribery investigation.\nThe RCMP believe four top executives with the company, including CEO Longbo Chen who took over in 2012, ignored warnings from Canadian financial advisers and signed off on a string of illegal payments to Congolese officials.\nNone of the allegations contained in the\u00a0search warrant have been tested in court, and the RCMP has not laid any charges.\nWhen asked for comment for this story, the company and its officials declined.\nRCMP began \"Project Aloes\" in late 2013 after a lead accountant on MagIndustries' Mengo potash project\u00a0in Pointe Noir, Congo, contacted Canadian Embassy officials. The Canadian accountant\u00a0alleges his new Chinese bosses at MagIndustries ignored his refusals to pay out $12,000\u00a0in cash to government officials.\nThe accountant believes the money was to help win permission to expropriate\u00a0290 hectares of land to build a seaside shipping terminal near the company's new potash processing facility. Canadian prosecutors involved in the case blanked out portions of the unsealed search warrant, including the names of the accountant and the Congolese officials involved, citing the need to protect the ongoing investigation.\nMagIndustires was working closely with various Congolese officials including Pierre Oba, mining minister, and Pierre Mabiala, minister of land ownership, the warrant states. Neither of those men are accused of doing anything wrong in the public portions of the RCMP\u00a0search warrant.\nThe accountant told the RCMP in a video\u00adtaped statement that ultimately he was terminated for his refusal to approve the illegal payments, after being told by a company official \"that it was the way to conduct business in Africa.\"\nThe cash payments flagged by the whistle\u00adblower, it turns out, were not the first of their\u00a0kind. In March 2014, the RCMP\u00a0seized MagIndustries' emails from the company's internet service provider. Those\u00a0communications reveal auditors and company executives were wrestling with what is described in\u00a0internal emails as\u00a0five \"black money\" payments made in 2012 to government tax officials.\nThe company, using the subsidiary Eucalpytus Fibre Congo, agreed to a series of\u00a0\"under the table\" payments to unnamed tax officials totalling $102,000. In exchange, the company was granted a deep discount in the amount of tax it had to officially pay to Congolese authorities, the warrant alleges.\nEucalpytus kept two sets of books with one company official explaining\u00a0they agreed to the payoffs \"in exchange for cost \u00adefficiency,\" the court documents state. The\u00a0RCMP\u00a0warrant also cites evidence the company\u00a0believed only Chinese employees should work in the finance department.\u00a0In 2012,\u00a0MagIndustries\u00a0hired an outside \"governance specialist,\" consultant Michael Gunns, who began sounding alarm bells and\u00a0advising executives the scheme could be in violation of Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.\nIn August 2013, Gunns travelled to Congo where he met with the whistle\u00adblowing accountant. Gunns began asking questions, and a month later\u00a0he too was terminated. The RCMP warrant materials cite a Sept. 22, 2013, email from risk manager Kevin Stephens to MagIndustries CEO Longbo Chen, expressing worry the situation was handled poorly and that the accountant \"for the past two years had been privy to some sensitive and confidential company information such as per diem payments made to certain members of the Congolese government, tax and other financial issues.\"\nThe RCMP\u00a0document\u00a0states\u00a0\"Stephens emphasized that they needed to avoid any possibility that [name redacted] might release anything of a sensitive nature to the Congolese government, or worse, the Canadian government.\"\nForensic auditor Peter Dent works with corruption watchdog Transparency International. In an interview, he said the Republic of Congo is ranked as\u00a0one of the most corrupt countries in the world.\nWhile he stresses he's not familiar with the specifics of this particular story, he rejects the notion that allegations such as the ones laid out above can merely be dismissed as the cost of doing business in some of the world's more shadowy jurisdictions.\u00a0\nIf there is a cost, it's to be more scrupulous, he said.\u00a0\"One of the\u00a0costs of doing business in one of the most corrupt\u00a0regions of the world would be to have very robust compliance programs,\" he said. \"The risks are much higher and therefore the due diligence that's going to be required on the business\u00a0is likely going to be more expensive as well.\"\nHe notes\u00a0there are numerous\u00a0examples of foreign companies taking over a Canadian company and then using Canada's stellar business reputation as they operate abroad.\n\"It does give them perhaps a degree of credibility that they would not otherwise have had operating from their\u00a0home jurisdiction,\" he said.\nMagIndustries launched an internal probe in January after the\u00a0RCMP raided its Toronto headquarters. Ontario securities regulators have been keeping a close eye on the company ever since, and as part of an order from the Ontario Securities Commission, the company must file a report on the probe by June 1 or risk\u00a0an immediate halt on the trading of MagIndustries shares on the TSX.\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Loblaw hikes dividend as profit up 21% in first quarter", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/loblaw-hikes-dividend-as-profit-up-21-in-first-quarter-1.3063024", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["May 06, 2015 8:31 AM ET", "2015-05-06T12:37:40.460Z"], "source": null, "content": "Loblaw Companies Ltd. is reporting a big jump in first quarter profit as it benefits from major strategic moves, including the purchase of Shoppers Drug Mart.\nCanada's largest grocery company says its net income was up 21.7 per cent from the same time last year, rising to $146 million and its adjusted net income was up 96.7 per cent to $301 million.\nLoblaw's overall revenue for the quarter ended March 22 was $10.05 billion, up $2.76 billion or 37.8 per cent from the same time last year.\nMost of the increased revenue came from Shoppers Drug Mart, the country's largest pharmacy retailer.\nLoblaw says its quarterly dividend will go up by two per cent to 25 cents per common share, starting in July.\nMore to come\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Going, but not forgotten, Nortel's many legacies", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/going-but-not-forgotten-nortel-s-many-legacies-1.825421", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jan 14, 2009 5:25 PM ET", "2009-01-14T21:59:26.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "For younger investors accustomed to seeing the Toronto Stock Exchange rise and fall in rhythm with the price of a barrel of oil, it may be\u00a0astonishing\u00a0that it once rose and fell on news releases from one company that made things. Lots of things.\nAt its height, Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the TSX. It once employed more than 95,000 employees and had a stock market value of $366 billion, making it Canada's most valuable company.\nOn\u00a0Tuesday, its stock value\u00a0was worth less than $200 million.\n\"In terms of the legacy, Nortel is kind of like Wayne Gretzky. All those goals he scored in Edmonton didn\u2019t go away just because he moved to Los Angeles,\" said Duncan Stewart of D-S-A-M Consulting. \"Great things were still accomplished.\u00a0 Nortel had some great inventions, it will always be a great pioneer.\"\nNortel is headquartered in Brampton, Ont., but its research and development centre was in Ottawa where it was one of the original anchors of what came to be called Silicon Valley North.\nIt had other R&D sites in Montreal, Belleville and Calgary, as well as in the U.S. and overseas.\nStewart said wherever Nortel went, smaller technology startups would form around it, taking advantage of its expertise, often hiring its former employees.\n\"Ten years ago, if this had happened, the Canadian tech landscape would be gutted. Nortel wasn't just the anchor, it was 90 per cent of the industry. Everyone worked or partnered with Nortel,\" said Stewart.\n\"That hasn't been the case in a decade. There are new companies in Ottawa now like Cognos and Newbridge/Alcatel.\u00a0It's still an important company \u2014 maybe $1.5 billion in R&D spending. But Silicon Valley North has become more fragmented and therefore the 'loss' of Nortel will be less catastrophic than it was 10 or 20 years ago,\" he said.\nMark Evans of ME Consulting keeps track of the company on his blog, All About Nortel. He thinks it's a little early to be talking about Nortel's legacy since it hasn't gone anywhere yet.\n\"I think jumping to the conclusion that Nortel is going to disappear because it's filed for bankruptcy protection is probably premature. The new Nortel will be smaller, more viable. It will continue to have a role \u2014 just a lot less significant role.\"\nOne legacy Nortel would prefer was less significant is its accounting scandal.\nIn October 2007, it paid $35 million US to settle\u00a0the Securities and Exchange Commission's\u00a0fraud charges over the company's\u00a0accounting.\u00a0The SEC accused Nortel of manipulating its financial reports to meet its earnings guidance and of artificially reducing its profit in late 2002 to avoid returning to the black earlier than it had forecast.\nIt also filed civil\u00a0charges against several\u00a0former Nortel Networks executives, including ex-CEO Frank Dunn for\u00a0\"repeatedly engaging in accounting fraud to bridge gaps between Nortel's true performance, its internal targets and Wall Street expectations.\"\n\"Nortel never recovered from its numerous accounting scandals and I think the credit crunch was its ultimate undoing,\" said Mark Sue, the Telecom Equity Research Director for R-B-C Capital Markets.\n\"Nortel was stuck in a restructuring mode perpetually following the scandal. It's a sad and disappointing end for the company,\" he said.\n\"I don't think Nortel's accounting trouble had a big impact on the Canadian economic landscape,\" said Mark\u00a0 Evans. \"Nortel fell victim to its own troubles, I don't think it reflects badly on Canadian companies doing business globally. It just operates in a very competitive industry that is undergoing significant change. Nortel is not adapting as it should be.\"\n\"The thing about Nortel is that it's not a telecom equipment maker any more. It's outrsourced mostly everything and become a sales/service development company.\u00a0For the most part, its assets aren't plants, it's people. What Canada needs going forward in the new economy is people power. It's about ideas and innovations driving the economy rather than making widgets at a low price,\" said Evans.\nThe fact that Nortel no longer dominates the TSX, and in fact may be about to be delisted, doesn't concern Fred Ketchen, a director and equity trader with Scotia McLeod. He was a trader when the company was known as Northern Telecom.\n\"Technology is a sector that most people are amazed by, but don't understand,\" he said.\u00a0 \"People think it's new and everlasting but it's not, there's something new to come along after it. Nortel was the market darling for a long, long time. Everyone thought its stock price wasn't going to $1,000, they thought it was going to $8,000 for goodness sake. But times do change. Sometimes it's going to be commodities, who knows where the next move is going to be but I can tell you there will be a next move.\"\nEvans agrees.\n\"A lot of people invested in Nortel because it was a Canadian company and they felt an emotional bond to it. Even when the company started to struggle, everyone wanted to believe that it and the stock was going to rebound. They weren't buying on fundamentals, they were buying on emotion and that's a very dangerous habit to have when investing,\" he said.\n\"And Nortel did nothing to deter the enthusiasm of investors.

Lots of things.\nAt its height, Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the TSX. It once employed more than 95,000 employees and had a stock market value of $366 billion, making it Canada's most valuable company.\nOn\u00a0Tuesday, its stock value\u00a0was worth less than $200 million.\n\"In terms of the legacy, Nortel is kind of like Wayne Gretzky. All those goals he scored in Edmonton didn\u2019t go away just because he moved to Los Angeles,\" said Duncan Stewart of D-S-A-M Consulting. \"Great things were still accomplished.\u00a0 Nortel had some great inventions, it will always be a great pioneer.\"\nNortel is headquartered in Brampton, Ont., but its research and development centre was in Ottawa where it was one of the original anchors of what came to be called Silicon Valley North.\nIt had other R&D sites in Montreal, Belleville and Calgary, as well as in the U.S. and overseas.\nStewart said wherever Nortel went, smaller technology startups would form around it, taking advantage of its expertise, often hiring its former employees.\n\"Ten years ago, if this had happened, the Canadian tech landscape would be gutted. Nortel wasn't just the anchor, it was 90 per cent of the industry. Everyone worked or partnered with Nortel,\" said Stewart.\n\"That hasn't been the case in a decade. There are new companies in Ottawa now like Cognos and Newbridge/Alcatel.\u00a0It's still an important company \u2014 maybe $1.5 billion in R&D spending. But Silicon Valley North has become more fragmented and therefore the 'loss' of Nortel will be less catastrophic than it was 10 or 20 years ago,\" he said.\nMark Evans of ME Consulting keeps track of the company on his blog, All About Nortel. He thinks it's a little early to be talking about Nortel's legacy since it hasn't gone anywhere yet.\n\"I think jumping to the conclusion that Nortel is going to disappear because it's filed for bankruptcy protection is probably premature. The new Nortel will be smaller, more viable. It will continue to have a role \u2014 just a lot less significant role.\"\nOne legacy Nortel would prefer was less significant is its accounting scandal.\nIn October 2007, it paid $35 million US to settle\u00a0the Securities and Exchange Commission's\u00a0fraud charges over the company's\u00a0accounting.\u00a0The SEC accused Nortel of manipulating its financial reports to meet its earnings guidance and of artificially reducing its profit in late 2002 to avoid returning to the black earlier than it had forecast.\nIt also filed civil\u00a0charges against several\u00a0former Nortel Networks executives, including ex-CEO Frank Dunn for\u00a0\"repeatedly engaging in accounting fraud to bridge gaps between Nortel's true performance, its internal targets and Wall Street expectations.\"\n\"Nortel never recovered from its numerous accounting scandals and I think the credit crunch was its ultimate undoing,\" said Mark Sue, the Telecom Equity Research Director for R-B-C Capital Markets.\n\"Nortel was stuck in a restructuring mode perpetually following the scandal. It's a sad and disappointing end for the company,\" he said.\n\"I don't think Nortel's accounting trouble had a big impact on the Canadian economic landscape,\" said Mark\u00a0 Evans. \"Nortel fell victim to its own troubles, I don't think it reflects badly on Canadian companies doing business globally. It just operates in a very competitive industry that is undergoing significant change. Nortel is not adapting as it should be.\"\n\"The thing about Nortel is that it's not a telecom equipment maker any more. It's outrsourced mostly everything and become a sales/service development company.\u00a0For the most part, its assets aren't plants, it's people. What Canada needs going forward in the new economy is people power. It's about ideas and innovations driving the economy rather than making widgets at a low price,\" said Evans.\nThe fact that Nortel no longer dominates the TSX, and in fact may be about to be delisted, doesn't concern Fred Ketchen, a director and equity trader with Scotia McLeod. He was a trader when the company was known as Northern Telecom.\n\"Technology is a sector that most people are amazed by, but don't understand,\" he said.\u00a0 \"People think it's new and everlasting but it's not, there's something new to come along after it. Nortel was the market darling for a long, long time. Everyone thought its stock price wasn't going to $1,000, they thought it was going to $8,000 for goodness sake. But times do change. Sometimes it's going to be commodities, who knows where the next move is going to be but I can tell you there will be a next move.\"\nEvans agrees.\n\"A lot of people invested in Nortel because it was a Canadian company and they felt an emotional bond to it. Even when the company started to struggle, everyone wanted to believe that it and the stock was going to rebound. They weren't buying on fundamentals, they were buying on emotion and that's a very dangerous habit to have when investing,\" he said.\n\"And Nortel did nothing to deter the enthusiasm of investors. At the height of the dot.com boom, [then CEO] John Roth was out there saying Nortel was going to double its sales to $40 billion, so they were as guilty as anybody of feeding the machine. Canadians wanted to be excited about a technology company\u00a0\u2026\u00a0got solidly behind Nortel and jumped without fully realizing what they were doing.\"\u00a0\nSo what will be left of the once-mighty telecommunication giant?\u00a0A few blue-glass and concrete office buildings that suggest modernity and progress but are, for the most part,\u00a0empty?\n\"Nortel is already down 75,000 people from where it once was,\" said Duncan Stewart.\n\"Many employees have gone on to new companies and made new innovations and continue to do well and excel.

The company has been\u00a0developing a $1.5-billion potash mine and processing facility\u00a0in the West African country for several years.\nSearch warrant materials obtained by CBC News tell a cautionary tale about the company, which is registered in Toronto but controlled by Chinese interests since a takeover in 2011.\u00a0Those investors and managers are now ensnared\u00a0in an international police bribery investigation.\nThe RCMP believe four top executives with the company, including CEO Longbo Chen who took over in 2012, ignored warnings from Canadian financial advisers and signed off on a string of illegal payments to Congolese officials.\nNone of the allegations contained in the\u00a0search warrant have been tested in court, and the RCMP has not laid any charges.\nWhen asked for comment for this story, the company and its officials declined.\nRCMP began \"Project Aloes\" in late 2013 after a lead accountant on MagIndustries' Mengo potash project\u00a0in Pointe Noir, Congo, contacted Canadian Embassy officials. The Canadian accountant\u00a0alleges his new Chinese bosses at MagIndustries ignored his refusals to pay out $12,000\u00a0in cash to government officials.\nThe accountant believes the money was to help win permission to expropriate\u00a0290 hectares of land to build a seaside shipping terminal near the company's new potash processing facility. Canadian prosecutors involved in the case blanked out portions of the unsealed search warrant, including the names of the accountant and the Congolese officials involved, citing the need to protect the ongoing investigation.\nMagIndustires was working closely with various Congolese officials including Pierre Oba, mining minister, and Pierre Mabiala, minister of land ownership, the warrant states. Neither of those men are accused of doing anything wrong in the public portions of the RCMP\u00a0search warrant.\nThe accountant told the RCMP in a video\u00adtaped statement that ultimately he was terminated for his refusal to approve the illegal payments, after being told by a company official \"that it was the way to conduct business in Africa.\"\nThe cash payments flagged by the whistle\u00adblower, it turns out, were not the first of their\u00a0kind. In March 2014, the RCMP\u00a0seized MagIndustries' emails from the company's internet service provider. Those\u00a0communications reveal auditors and company executives were wrestling with what is described in\u00a0internal emails as\u00a0five \"black money\" payments made in 2012 to government tax officials.\nThe company, using the subsidiary Eucalpytus Fibre Congo, agreed to a series of\u00a0\"under the table\" payments to unnamed tax officials totalling $102,000. In exchange, the company was granted a deep discount in the amount of tax it had to officially pay to Congolese authorities, the warrant alleges.\nEucalpytus kept two sets of books with one company official explaining\u00a0they agreed to the payoffs \"in exchange for cost \u00adefficiency,\" the court documents state. The\u00a0RCMP\u00a0warrant also cites evidence the company\u00a0believed only Chinese employees should work in the finance department.\u00a0In 2012,\u00a0MagIndustries\u00a0hired an outside \"governance specialist,\" consultant Michael Gunns, who began sounding alarm bells and\u00a0advising executives the scheme could be in violation of Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.\nIn August 2013, Gunns travelled to Congo where he met with the whistle\u00adblowing accountant. Gunns began asking questions, and a month later\u00a0he too was terminated. The RCMP warrant materials cite a Sept. 22, 2013, email from risk manager Kevin Stephens to MagIndustries CEO Longbo Chen, expressing worry the situation was handled poorly and that the accountant \"for the past two years had been privy to some sensitive and confidential company information such as per diem payments made to certain members of the Congolese government, tax and other financial issues.\"\nThe RCMP\u00a0document\u00a0states\u00a0\"Stephens emphasized that they needed to avoid any possibility that [name redacted] might release anything of a sensitive nature to the Congolese government, or worse, the Canadian government.\"\nForensic auditor Peter Dent works with corruption watchdog Transparency International. In an interview, he said the Republic of Congo is ranked as\u00a0one of the most corrupt countries in the world.\nWhile he stresses he's not familiar with the specifics of this particular story, he rejects the notion that allegations such as the ones laid out above can merely be dismissed as the cost of doing business in some of the world's more shadowy jurisdictions.\u00a0\nIf there is a cost, it's to be more scrupulous, he said.\u00a0\"One of the\u00a0costs of doing business in one of the most corrupt\u00a0regions of the world would be to have very robust compliance programs,\" he said. \"The risks are much higher and therefore the due diligence that's going to be required on the business\u00a0is likely going to be more expensive as well.\"\nHe notes\u00a0there are numerous\u00a0examples of foreign companies taking over a Canadian company and then using Canada's stellar business reputation as they operate abroad.\n\"It does give them perhaps a degree of credibility that they would not otherwise have had operating from their\u00a0home jurisdiction,\" he said.\nMagIndustries launched an internal probe in January after the\u00a0RCMP raided its Toronto headquarters. Ontario securities regulators have been keeping a close eye on the company ever since, and as part of an order from the Ontario Securities Commission, the company must file a report on the probe by June 1 or risk\u00a0an immediate halt on the trading of MagIndustries shares on the TSX.\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Forbes billionaires: 10 people who made this year's list", "description": "Bill Gates still the richest, but new players in the tech world closing in", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/forbes-billionaires-10-people-who-made-this-year-s-list-1.2978748", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Mar 02, 2015 3:10 PM ET", "2015-03-02T22:54:55.000Z"], "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Dan Healing", "title": "Statoil sells oilsands assets to Athabasca Oil in deal worth up to $832 million", "description": "Up to $250 million more will be paid in a series of contingent payments", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/statoil-athabasca-sale-1.3897310", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2778138.1411677505!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/statoil-calgary.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 14, 2016 6:17 PM MT", "2016-12-15T01:17:05.826Z"], "source": null, "content": "Calgary-based Athabasca Oil Corp.\u00a0is buying the northern Alberta oilsands operations of Norwegian oil giant Statoil ASA in a deal worth up to $832 million.\nThe sale includes Statoil's six-year-old Leismer thermal oilsands project, which uses steam to produce 24,000 barrels per day of bitumen from wells, and its proposed Corner oilsands project.\nStatoil says Athabasca\u00a0(TSX:ATH)\u00a0has agreed to pay $435 million in cash plus issue 100 million Athabasca shares worth about $147 million.\nUp to $250 million more will be paid in a series of contingent payments triggered if West Texas Intermediate oil prices rise above US$65 per barrel.\nStatoil vice-president Lars Christian Bacher says the deal will allow it to focus on core activities including its operations offshore Newfoundland.\nThe share issue will give Statoil a stake of just under 20 per cent in Athabasca.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sears Canada sees revenue slide in fourth quarter", "description": "Company reports loss, including adjustments, of $28.8 million", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sears-canada-sees-revenue-slide-in-fourth-quarter-1.2970808", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2785158.1484845031!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/sears-canada.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Feb 25, 2015 7:47 AM ET", "2015-02-25T12:50:14.993Z"], "source": null, "content": "Sears Canada Inc. says its fourth-quarter revenue was down 17.7 per cent from a year earlier to $972.5 million.\nThe national retailer said the decline was primarily due to store closures and a 9.1 per cent decline in same-store sales.

In January, sales to retailers for at-home consumption fell by more than 10 per cent, or by almost nine per cent excluding the impact of the termination of an agreement to distribute Miller brands.\nPart of that decrease can be attributed to macro-economic factors, including higher food prices, said Stewart Glendinning, chief executive of Molson Coors Canada.\n\"The consumer is under pressure,\" he said Thursday during a conference call on the company's fourth-quarter and 2015 results.\n\"And if you add to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada is at an all-time high, it's made for quite a difficult recipe in some of those provinces.\"\nSales volumes for Coors Light were also reduced in Quebec by the brewer's decision to raise prices for its flagship brand.\nMolson Coors (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) said its net income plummeted 65 per cent to US$32.8 million in the fourth quarter because of lower sales, currency fluctuations and reduced income from operations in Canada and the United States.\nThe company, which reports in U.S. dollars, said its underlying profit in the quarter, excluding one-time items, was $90.6 million or 49 cents per share, down 11.3 per cent from $102.1 million or 55 cents per share a year earlier.\nNet sales for the period ended Dec. 31 were $844.4 million, compared were $973.8 million a year earlier \u2014 a decrease of 13.3 per cent, or 3.5 per cent excluding currency fluctuations.\nIn Canada, adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell 32 per cent to $51.8 million on $341.9 million in net sales. That compared with $76.2 million on US$423.1 million in net sales for the same period a year earlier.\nThe drop in profits was partially due to a US$6.9-million currency hit from the lower Canadian dollar. Excluding currency, profits decreased 23 per cent.\nFor the full year, the company's (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) net profits decreased to US$359.5 million from $514 million in 2014. Underlying profits were $700.4 million or $3.76 per share, down from $768.5 million or $4.13 per share a year earlier.

He also plans to decorate the space with memorabilia that harkens back to the building's rock star days.\nThe firm says it will also keep the main concert hall's design so that it can move out office desks for its annual black-tie charity rock concert.

But more than 61 per cent of them still couldn't beat theU.S. benchmark index\u2014the S&P 500.\nActive management refers to funds where managers make the decisions about what stocks to buy or sell. In passively-managed funds,thefunds are designed to automatically track a particular index.\n\"Active managers are having a hard time in this year's volatile markets,\" said Standard & Poor's Jasmit Bhandal, in astatement.\nOver the last five years, the record of underperformance has been even more pronounced. Standard & Poor's said only 13.9 per cent of Canadian equity funds have outperformed the S&P/TSX composite index.\nIn the same time span, about a quarter of actively-managed U.S. equity funds have beaten the S&P 500 index.\nSmall-cap managers more successful in beating market\nManagers of Canadian small-cap equity funds have had more success, S&P said. In the first six months of 2006, almost half of Canadian small-cap funds managed to beat the S&P/TSX Small Cap Index. And in several quartersbefore 2006, a majority of small-cap managers beat the relevant index.\nOne big reason why actively-managed funds often fail to beat the market has to do with the fees charged to the fund. Actively-managed funds are more expensive to run than passive ones. The various fees and expenses \u2014 often two to three per cent of the fund's value \u2014 are deducted before returns are calculated.\nSo active managers must, in effect, beat the market by that two or three per cent just to break even. That's difficult to consistently do, although some fund managers areable to do it.\nExchange-traded funds and index funds\u2014 which are designed to track a particular index\u2014 won't ever beat the market. But they do provide similar diversification at a fraction of the fees that actively-managed funds charge.\nSupporters of active management point out that theirfeesare used, in part, to compensatefinancial planners and advisors for the ongoing service of their clients' accounts.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Bell won't sell more of Astral's assets to win OK for merger", "description": "Astral Media CEO says impact would be 'severe' if CRTC denies Bell's pitch", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bell-won-t-sell-more-of-astral-s-assets-to-win-ok-for-merger-1.1355755", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1577234.1379053564!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/hi-bell-bce-cope-8col.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 10, 2013 12:16 PM ET", "2013-05-10T16:14:47.000Z"], "source": null, "content": "Bell would walk away from buying Astral Media if it's asked to sell any more of the TV specialty and radio company's assets in order to win regulatory approval for the $3.4-billion merger, chief executive George Cope said Friday.\nCope said there wouldn't be any \"strategic rationale\" to buy Astral if it had to sell more of its assets to obtain the OK from the CRTC, which has already turned down the deal once.\n\"If we were to be asked to divest any more of the channels or content, we would not move forward with the transaction,\" Cope said.\nRogers Communications (TSX:RCI.B) has asked the CRTC to force Bell to sell Astral's English language pay TV service, the Movie Network, as a condition of approving the revised deal.

With Mott's arrival, former CEO Courtney Pratt became Stelco's chairman. \nMott bought 1 million shares at $5.50 each \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an investment that returned him a quick profit of almost $14 million, at least on paper.

Stelco says its Hamilton operations are not competitive. \nStelco's rebirth comes 26 months after it filed for creditor protection. What followed was one of the most convoluted, expensive, and unusual restructurings in Canadian corporate history. \nThe restructuring was unusual because steel prices rebounded strongly after the creditor protection filing, leading to big profits at a company that had been losing money. \nThe good times weren't to last, however. Steel prices were falling again by 2005, and the company posted a $120-million loss in its most recent quarter. \nStelco ended up selling several subsidiaries and shedding 1,500 workers.

GMI's survey looked at fewer companies than TD's report, which may account for the difference.\nAccording to GMI Ratings, Canada ranked 9th among major industrialized nations for female board membership in 2011.

Second, and more troubling to economists, it implies a market failure to appreciate the skills and perspectives that women can bring to the table.\"\nWhat the report doesn't call for is for quotas for women\u00a0on boards, similar to what exists in countries like Norway and the United Arab Emirates.\n\"They are the antithesis of merit,\"\u00a0writes Caranci. \"They also risk stigmatizing qualified women on boards as 'tokens'.\"\u00a0\nInstead, the report calls for a tough new \"comply or explain\" policy, which would require companies\u00a0to put gender diversity policies in place when it comes to choosing new board members. It would allow companies to ignore those policies, but only if they explain why to shareholders.\nIt also calls for companies to disclose the proportion of board members and\u00a0senior executives that are female,\u00a0so progress can be measured.\u00a0The report says this would increase transparency, awareness and accountability on gender diversity.\nWhile the number of women on boards at Canadian companies is falling behind, the number of women at the top of major Canadian companies is even lower.\nNone of the S&P/TSX 60 companies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the 60 largest publicly traded companies in Canada\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have female CEOs.

Organizations are not taking concrete steps like having formal board evaluations, setting term and age limits, and implementing gender diversity policies.\n\"We have a long, long way to go before we really see not only the level of diversity across all boards that we would like to see, but also the level of diversity that we know drives real business results,\" Sutton said.\nIn 2015, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) introduced disclosure requirements for the representation of women on boards and in executive officer positions.\n\"They said basically, OK, if you're not going to have women on your boards then you need to explain why you're not,\" said Deborah Rosati, founder and chief executive of Women Get on Board.\nSince then, the CSA has released four reviews of the data provided by participating jurisdictions: Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan. The most recent review shows the share of board seats held by women in participating jurisdictions increased to 15 per cent in 2018 from 11 per cent in 2015.\nThe \"comply or explain\" requirement isn't nearly as forceful as some of the requirements in other countries, Rosati said.\nMany countries have set quotas regulating the minimum number of women sitting on public corporate boards, and there are two types: soft and hard quotas.\nSiri Terjesen, dean's research fellow and professor at American University's Kogod School of Business, said Spain is an example of a country with a soft quota, where there are no consequences for failing to achieve a gender-balanced board. Soft quotas are more guidelines than rules, and they're not as effective, she said.\nNorway enacted a hard quota in 2003 requiring publicly traded companies' boards be composed of at least 40 per cent of each gender by 2008. Corporations that did not comply could have faced various penalties ranging from paying fines to being delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange.\nTerjesen said quotas have been successful for Norway but quotas aren't always the answer.\n\"If the rules become too overbearing then many firms will actually seriously consider going private,\" she said. \"A quota should really only be a last resort,\" she said.\nAustralia, for instance, has been successful at improving female representation without having a hard quota, said Pamela Warren, a partner at Egon Zehnder and an expert in chief executive succession and board recruitment.\nThe Australian Institute of Company Directors set a target for all boards to have 30 per cent of their directors female by 2018. By the end of December 2018, they had almost reached their goal, at 29.7 per cent. Participation in this initiative was voluntary for organizations.\nWarren said Canada isn't that far behind the global diversity leaders. That's true in certain areas.\nBusiness law firm Osler analyzed how TSX-listed companies in Canada compare in promoting women in leadership roles. Its 2018 Diversity Disclosure Practices report found that women hold 28.4 per cent of the board seats for S&P/TSX 60 companies, compared to 26 per cent of seats the year before.\nQuotas and targets have had some success but they don't address the issue of access, one expert says.\nHeather Shantora, chief executive of medical services companies PT Health and InnoCare Ltd., said there is a lack of seats available for women on boards.\n\"Perhaps board positions need to be time-limited and then they have to turn over, because in some cases there's literally not an available seat for a woman,\" Shantora said.\nThis echoes what Sutton suggests about implementing term and age limits for board members to encourage faster turnover.\n\nAnother solution, she said, is having more visible female leaders that others can look up to.\nThere are many intelligent and professional women out there, but they're not necessarily going after board positions, Shantora said.\n\"It may be that they're not because they don't see themselves on boards,\" she said.\n\"If you think of boards and the automatic picture that comes to your mind is a group of men, you may never put yourself forward.\"\nWhen she started out at her company, she said she was the only female on the management team. Now, her company is about 60 per cent female.\n\"One of the things I realized early on is that I had to be more vocal \u2014 like, literally louder at the boardroom table to be heard than some of my male counterparts,\" she said.\n\"But I'm thankful to be here because I made it easier for hundreds of women to work with me,\u00a0to clear their path forward,\" she said.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "BlackBerry co-founder Mike Lazaridis sells $26M US in shares", "description": "Sale puts Lazaridis stake in company at less than 5% ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/blackberry-co-founder-mike-lazaridis-sells-26m-us-in-shares-1.2476040", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Dec 24, 2013 6:56 PM ET", "2013-12-26T13:32:27.241Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Mike Lazaridis has cashed in shares of\u00a0BlackBerry, making $26 million US in the process, as he lessens his stake in the smartphone company he helped create.\nDocuments filed with U.S. regulators on Tuesday show that a\u00a0numbered company registered in Ontario and controlled by Lazaridis has sold 3.5 million shares in BlackBerry since Monday.\nThe two transactions take Lazaridis' stake below five per cent of BlackBerry, which is the threshold where he would be required by\u00a0regulators to report any future sales of shares in the company.\nThe first sale was made on Monday when 3.17 million shares were\u00a0sold at an average price of $7.55 on the open market.\nThe second transaction came on Christmas Eve Day when the same\u00a0numbered company sold 333,107 shares at an average price of $7.63.\nIn total, the transactions reaped $26.5 million.\nBoth sales were made through 1258701 Ontario Ltd., an investment\u00a0holding company, according to the documents from the U.S. Securities\u00a0and Exchange Commission.\nIn October, the numbered company was part of an effort by\u00a0BlackBerry co-founders Lazaridis and Doug Fregin to submit a bid for\u00a0BlackBerry when the Waterloo, Ont.based firm was hunting for potential buyers.\nPlans to sell the company were eventually scrapped when Fairfax\u00a0Financial (TSX:FFX), one of BlackBerry's largest shareholders, came\u00a0up with a plan to raise a billion dollars in hopes to resuscitate\u00a0the struggling company instead.\nMajor changes were made almost immediately, with the hiring of\u00a0John Chen as chairman and chief executive officer.

Seniors, in particular, loved them for their ability to provide steady income that often far exceeded what was available from traditional dividend-paying firms.\nBy the middle of 2006, they had\u00a0become so ubiquitous\u00a0that telecom giants Telus Corp. and\u00a0BCE Inc.\u00a0were considering converting themselves from the traditional corporate structure into income trusts\u00a0in order to reduce their tax burden. Then, Gord Nixon, CEO of\u00a0the Royal Bank of Canada, mused publicly about the possibility of converting all or part of the biggest bank in the country into an income trust.\nThe federal government\u00a0had been concerned about \"tax leakage\" before, but the possibility of two of Canada's largest companies using the structure was enough to force Ottawa's hand into action.\nOn Oct. 31, 2006, Flaherty said income trusts, with the exception of real estate investment trusts that adhere to strict rules, would be subject to\u00a0tax\u00a0on trust distributions \u2014 effectively, making them treated the same way corporations are.\nThe stock-market value of these vehicles, which paid no corporate\u00a0taxes but rather passed\u00a0their profits on to unitholders who were then taxed, took more than a 15 per cent haircut in reaction to the news. Some fared much worse.\nUnder the new rules, all new trusts from that date forward would be subject to the new tax regime, but Flaherty gave existing trusts (of which there were 255 on the TSX at the time, collectively worth more than $200 billion) until the then-far-off date of Jan. 1, 2011 to meet the new requirements.\nThat deadline will come and go on Saturday, and while the sector is far from non-existent, it's a shadow of its former self.\nLast month, Eagle Energy Trust debuted on the TSX \u2014 the first Canadian-listed oil and gas trust to launch since Flaherty's Halloween surprise. The company\u00a0holds only\u00a0foreign oil-producing assets \u2014 a loophole that excludes it from the new tax regime.\nMost of the big names have already converted back into corporations. Financial services titan CI Financial converted to a trust in June 2006, before the announcement.\u00a0The\u00a0changing of the rules\u00a0was enough to make CI convert back into corporate form in January 2009.\nYellow Pages Income Fund finalized its conversion on Nov. 1, while oil and gas producer Penn West was set to formally do so on Saturday.\nThere is now fewer than half the number of trusts on the TSX. The vast majority are REITs, but a few business trusts remain and will presumably operate under the new rules. Some have merely reduced their distributions roughly in line with the\u00a0taxes they'll have to pay beginning Saturday.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "CIBC boosts takeover offer for PrivateBancorp to more than $6B", "description": "New deal values Chicago-based PrivateBancorp at approximately $6.6 billion ", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-privatebancorp-raised-offer-1.4047455", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4047578.1490887264!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/cibc-privatebancorp-20161207.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Mar 30, 2017 11:32 AM ET", "2017-03-30T20:22:55.885Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Shares of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce traded lower Thursday after the bank boosted its takeover bid for PrivateBancorp by 20 per cent.\nUnder the terms of a new takeover agreement that has approved by the boards of directors of both firms, the deal values Chicago-based PrivateBancorp at approximately $6.6 billion Cdn, or $60.92 US per share,\nCIBC shares finished the day down $3.42, or almost three\u00a0per cent, at $113.78 on the TSX, while shares of PrivateBancorp\u00a0were up almost five per cent, climbing $2.80 US to close at $59\u00a0US on Nasdaq.\nThe two firms originally announced their takeover deal back in June 2016, but a shareholder vote on the agreement was put off after shares of PrivateBancorp rose above the offer price.\n\"The amended terms agreed between CIBC and PrivateBancorp reflect changes to trading market conditions and the interest rate environment since we announced the transaction in June 2016 as well as PrivateBancorp's continued strong performance,\" James\u00a0Guyette, the chairman of the\u00a0board of\u00a0PrivateBancorp, said in release.\n\"We continue to believe that a merger between CIBC and PrivateBancorp is a compelling opportunity that offers immediate and long-term value for PrivateBancorp stockholders,\" said \u00a0said Victor Dodig,\u00a0CIBC's president and CEO.\nUnder the revised deal, CIBC is now offering $24.20 US in cash and 0.4176 of a CIBC common share for each\u00a0PrivateBancorp share.\nPrivateBancorp shareholders are expected to vote on the CIBC\u00a0offer at a special meeting in mid-May.\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Quebecor World granted creditor protection", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quebecor-world-granted-creditor-protection-1.704586", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jan 21, 2008 9:43 AM ET", "2008-01-21T15:05:01.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Financially troubled printing giant Quebecor World Inc. on Monday obtained creditor protection in Quebec.\nThe company said the filing was a result of tough industry conditions \u2014 especially in Europe \u2014 and its failure to raise new capital.\nA\u00a0creditor protection filing was also\u00a0expected to be approved\u00a0in New York on Tuesday.\nInvestors sent the stock down\u00a017 cents to a finish of 16.5 cents on the TSX.

It wasn\u2019t all that long ago that getting broad market diversification\u00a0in a portfolio was costly and difficult, but exchange-traded funds have made do-it-yourself investing more practical\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and there are some big changes happening now in the Canadian ETF market as a result.\nIn the past, an investor would either have had to deal with a stock broker \u2013 an endangered species these days \u2013 to buy individual shares in companies. Or maybe pay to have a professional money manager manage their investments in a mutual fund.\nBut in 1990, a tiny product made its debut on the TSX and it ushered in a sea change in the way Canadians invested for retirement. That was when Toronto Index Participation Shares made their debut.\nModeled on instruments that had just appeared on the NYSE months earlier, TIPS were designed to track the Toronto 35 Index of the 35 largest companies on the TSX at the time.\nAlthough the acronym ETF (which stands of Exchange Traded Fund) wouldn\u2019t appear until a while later, the now ubiquitous investment vehicles were very much born out of TIPS.\nA recent CBC News article questions whether Canadians should be forced to save for retirement.\u00a0 Millions of Canadians put away next to nothing in RRSPs, while millions more put away just a fraction of what they're entitled to.\nWhere do you stand?\u00a0Should Canada create a mandatory retirement savings program?\u00a0\nIn recent years, the amount of money people have been socking away in ETFs has skyrocketed. From those humble origins, ETFs have grown into an asset class that holds almost $1.5 trillion US worth of investment dollars. And of the 2,500 ETFs in existence, a disproportionate number of them trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nOn paper, their appeal is obvious. They provide access to a broad basket of securities. They\u2019re also easy for investors to get in and out of, hopefully at a rock bottom price well below what would otherwise be possible in actively managed mutual funds or individual stocks.\nETFs appeal to passive investors, financial planner Judith Cane says, because they allow people to sit back and forget about an investment. \"Unless you\u2019re going to do this full-time, you can\u2019t outsmart the market.\"\nThere\u2019s certainly been a flood of money into the sector based on that line of thinking of late. Assets in Canadian ETFs rose by 13 per cent to $43 billion in November.\nETFs attracted almost 20 per cent more money in 2011 than they did in 2010, a trend that shows no sign of slowing despite wobbly global stock markets\nThat eye-popping growth data came from a recent report by NY-based BlackRock. As world\u2019s largest money manager, BlackRock knows what it's talking about. The company manages the popular line of iShares funds. From humble beginnings, iShares have grown to hold $28 billion in assets spread across almost 70 funds \u2013 good enough for a 67.5 per cent share of Canada\u2019s ETF market.\nIn January 2011, BlackRock moved to buy its next-largest Canadian rival, Claymore Investments. Headed by president and CEO Som Seif, Claymore is a subsidiary of Chicago-based Guggenheim Funds Services Group but under a deal unveiled on January 11, the company\u2019s funds will head over to BlackRock.\nWhile the company tries to differentiate its offerings in a number of ways, many of the company\u2019s funds use what\u2019s known as a \"fundamental indexing\" strategy. It\u2019s designed to guard against one company becoming so big that it tends to dominate holdings, as Nortel did in the 2000s when it grew to make up more than a third of the TSX\u2019s total value.\nAnother popular choice is Horizons Exchange Traded Funds Inc. The firm, founded as a part of Jovian Capital Corporation but recently sold to Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., offers a suite of passive and actively managed funds. Horizons has more than $3.3 billion under management.\nThe company has 75 ETFs on offer, but the two that tend to draw the most attention are the BetaPro Bull and Bear ETFs. Each uses leverage to accentuate the movements of the broader market. Every 1 per cent gain or rise in the TSX causes the corresponding BetaPro Bull or Bear ETF to increase by two per cent.\nAdvisers like them for short-term hedging strategies, but their fairly complicated structure has made them hard to understand \u2013 even dangerous \u2013 for retail investors, so they\u2019re largely a tool for investment professionals.\nHorizons also sells a suite of funds called AlphaPro that offer active management, aimed at investors who aren\u2019t happy with passively trying to track a popular benchmark.\nEven the big banks are getting in on the ETF action.\nRoyal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal have each come to market with broad equity ETFs of late, hoping to use their extensive retail networks and brand recognition to cater to investors looking for low-cost indexing.\nAlthough neither bank\u2019s ETF business has made a significant dent in market share as of yet, when Canada\u2019s big banks get involved in a sector it\u2019s only a matter of time before changes happen.\nWith that new financial heft, it\u2019s no surprise that ETFs are starting to do some new things. They\u2019ve been criticized for straying from their low-cost origins and getting into more and more niche products, for example.\nBut ultimately, the savvy investor has more choice than ever before, and that has to be a good thing, according to investing experts.\n\"I\u2019m a little concerned about some of the new entrants,\" says David Chilton, author of the popular investing book The Wealthy Barber and its new sequel. \"But the initial entrants that provide broad baskets of stocks at a low cost? It\u2019s tough to argue with that.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Oil up 14% in 3 days, Canadian dollar continues climb", "description": "OPEC announces plans for meeting with non-OPEC producers to finalize production cuts", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-dollar-markets-friday-1.3878259", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3871310.1500674641!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/oil-opec-cut.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Dec 02, 2016 10:32 AM ET", "2016-12-02T21:49:05.506Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "After a rally that has taken\u00a0the price of oil 14 per cent higher since\u00a0OPEC reached a deal to cut production on Wednesday, crude oil prices continued to climb in trading Friday.\nAfter sinking in overnight trading, West Texas Intermediate crude, the main North American contract rose another 62\u00a0cents to close at $51.68\u00a0US a barrel.\nBrent, the benchmark international oil contract, was up 42\u00a0cents to $54.36.\nThe Canadian dollar, which is sensitive to petroleum prices because of the importance of oil to the economy, continued to make gains.\nThe loonie closed up 0.19\u00a0of a\u00a0cent at 75.28 cents US.\nStock traders were also optimistic, with the TSX closing up 24.99\u00a0points at 15,052.52, although those gains were not enough to reverse yesterday's losses of 118 points.\nOn Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached agreement to cut 1.2 million barrels a day from its own production and projected another 600,000 barrels a day cut from non-OPEC sources.\nToday, it announced it will meet with \u00a0non-OPEC countries to finalize a pact on reducing production on Dec. 10 in Moscow.

In this year's report, released Friday, they looked at\u00a0executive compensation among the members of the TSX 60, which is a list of the 60 most valuable publicly traded companies in Canada. The group also delved into compensation practices at the next 60 largest firms, for a total pool of 120 Canadian companies.\nAmong the top tier, the numbers suggest that\u00a0executive compensation actually declined in 2015 from the previous year's level. All in, the typical CEO of a TSX 60 member company took in $7.89 million last year, down from $7.99 million in 2014.\nThe tier below, however, saw their pay packets increase from $3.91 million in 2014 to $4.06 million last year.\nThat's not just cash \u00a0\u2014 it includes base salaries, bonuses, stocks, stock options, pensions and other forms of compensation.\nWhile compensation for the top tier appears to have stabilized, it's done so after having risen by about 25 per cent in the previous six years, the report says. Managing director Robert Levasseur says in an interview that there's a clearer trend toward higher compensation at larger companies versus smaller ones.\n\"The larger the company, the higher the pay,\" he says.\u00a0\nExorbitant pay packages have come under increased scrutiny in recent years, but lost in the shuffle, Levasseur says, is the notion that\u00a0high-income CEOs\u00a0also contribute a disproportionately large amount to Canada's tax base.\nAccording to the report, the average CEO of one of Canada's biggest 60 companies paid $3.47 million in taxes last year, roughly 44 per cent of their income. That compares with the average industrial worker, who the report says paid\u00a0$8,067 in income taxes, or 16 per cent of their pay packet.\nThe company estimates that Canada's top CEOs paid about $200 million in income tax last year, a figure which is roughly equivalent to what 25,000 average industrial workers would have collectively paid.\nThat calculation does not factor in any tax avoidance strategies that may have been used, and instead is culled from a model that calculates\u00a0what a person would pay in taxable income on investment gains were their\u00a0stock-based compensation to be booked as regular income.\n\"There's this assumption that when you're a very high earner you don't pay any tax,\" Levasseur says. \"These people earn a lot of money but by the same token\u00a0they do pay a substantial amount of tax.\"\nAll in all, Levasseur says, executive compensation at large Canadian companies still pales in comparison to what happens at U.S. ones, where the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio currently sits at more than 300 to\u00a0 one.\nLevasseur says he's reluctant to come up, when asked, with a number of what the ratio should be as an ideal.\n\"It's really hard to determine what's reasonable,\" he says. \"I don't know if Jose Bautista's or Sidney Crosby's compensation is reasonable, but\u00a0they operate in an open market \u2014 they are getting out of the system as much as they can.\"\nMore important than how much a CEO is paid or how much they are paid compared to their workers is whether or not the company is getting value for that money.\n\"It's incumbent on boards to ensure they are comfortable with compensation,\" he says, \"but they have to be paying these people based on performance.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "Sleeman Breweries cutting jobs as revenue, earnings fall", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sleeman-breweries-cutting-jobs-as-revenue-earnings-fall-1.536396", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Aug 10, 2005 8:49 AM ET", "2005-08-10T20:09:23.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Sleeman Breweries reported lower sales and earnings in the second quarter, and said it's eliminating 40 jobs. \nThe Guelph, Ont., beer company (TSX:ALE) said it made $2.5 million (15 cents a share), down from $3.8 million (23 cents a share) in the second quarter of 2004. \nThe company's revenue for the quarter was $57.9 million compared to $58.7 million a year earlier. \n\"We had a challenging quarter due to the wet and cool spring across the country, the National Hockey League lockout and continued price discounting in our key markets,\" said John Sleeman, the company's chairman and CEO. \n\"In addition, the second quarter of last year benefited from the distribution strike in British Columbia and the first summer sales of our very successful low carbohydrate beer Sleeman Clear,\" he said. \nThe company said the 40 job cuts come as it tries to reduce its costs by $1 million in the current fiscal year.

Instead, it purchases seats from\u00a0Kelowna, B.C.-based Flair Airlines and resells them to the public. Flair Airlines, which owns and operates a fleet of Boeing 737-400 jets, is licensed under the CTA.\nOn March 30, the agency ruled in favour of\u00a0NewLeaf\u00a0and cleared the way for the company to resume ticket sales. At that time,\u00a0NewLeaf\u00a0CEO Jim Young said the company expected flights to take off in late spring or early summer.\nSince then, there's been little movement from the company.\nNewLeaf\u00a0was planning to fly\u00a0from:\nLisa Krishka, a spokeswoman for NewLeaf, said it still plans to begin travel this summer. She would not offer a specific restart date.\nCanadian aviation experts say a number of reasons may be behind the lack of clarity on a relaunch.\nOn Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed to hear an appeal by air passenger rights advocate regarding whether the CTA has the authority to permit NewLeaf to operate without a licence.\nAt issue, according to Gabor Lukacs, is that other companies have operated under similar business models and have required licences.\nHe doesn't expect the court to hear the appeal until at least the fall, but urged that passengers need to be cautious while the case is still under review.\nThe court did not say whether NewLeaf would have to put off its relaunch until the hearing. The company did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday after the court's decision.\nBut Robert Kokonis, president at aerospace consultancy AirTrav Inc., suspects NewLeaf may be trying to beef up investment before they launch again.\n\"The airline business is a cash-intensive business,\" he said.\u00a0\nKokonis said there is demand for discount carriers in Canada where base fares are low but any add-ons, from luggage to seat selection, are considered extras and come with accompanying fees.\n\"(Canada) is the only major aviation market in the world that doesn't have an ultra-low cost carrier,\" he said, noting that a number of factors stay in the way.\n\"We have a very high cost structure, fees, charges, and taxes that scares away ultra-low cost carriers. The successful ultra-low cost carriers of the world in the U.S., in continental Europe and Asia, thrive on a very dense geographic area to offer flights. ...

Instead, it purchases seats from\u00a0Kelowna, B.C.-based Flair Airlines and resells them to the public. Flair Airlines, which owns and operates a fleet of Boeing 737-400 jets, is licensed under the CTA.\nOn March 30, the agency ruled in favour of\u00a0NewLeaf\u00a0and cleared the way for the company to resume ticket sales. At that time,\u00a0NewLeaf\u00a0CEO Jim Young said the company expected flights to take off in late spring or early summer.\nSince then, there's been little movement from the company.\nNewLeaf\u00a0was planning to fly\u00a0from:\nLisa Krishka, a spokeswoman for NewLeaf, said it still plans to begin travel this summer. She would not offer a specific restart date.\nCanadian aviation experts say a number of reasons may be behind the lack of clarity on a relaunch.\nOn Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed to hear an appeal by air passenger rights advocate regarding whether the CTA has the authority to permit NewLeaf to operate without a licence.\nAt issue, according to Gabor Lukacs, is that other companies have operated under similar business models and have required licences.\nHe doesn't expect the court to hear the appeal until at least the fall, but urged that passengers need to be cautious while the case is still under review.\nThe court did not say whether NewLeaf would have to put off its relaunch until the hearing. The company did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday after the court's decision.\nBut Robert Kokonis, president at aerospace consultancy AirTrav Inc., suspects NewLeaf may be trying to beef up investment before they launch again.\n\"The airline business is a cash-intensive business,\" he said.\u00a0\nKokonis said there is demand for discount carriers in Canada where base fares are low but any add-ons, from luggage to seat selection, are considered extras and come with accompanying fees.\n\"(Canada) is the only major aviation market in the world that doesn't have an ultra-low cost carrier,\" he said, noting that a number of factors stay in the way.\n\"We have a very high cost structure, fees, charges, and taxes that scares away ultra-low cost carriers. The successful ultra-low cost carriers of the world in the U.S., in continental Europe and Asia, thrive on a very dense geographic area to offer flights. ...

Oil production could also come down very quickly.\nIt's unwelcome news for an oil and gas sector that has had its share of struggles in recent years, whether its pipeline bottlenecks or a glut of crude that spurred Alberta\u00a0to curtail oil production in the province.\nFurther decreases in Canadian production might actually relieve some pressure on the pipeline network.\u00a0But Monday's news\u00a0won't ease current anxiety around\u00a0the oilpatch, still stinging from thousands of jobs losses in recent years.\u00a0\nAlberta Premier Jason Kenney said Monday that his government's priority would be protecting jobs and the economy.\nBut when crude prices drop and stay low,\u00a0oil companies\u00a0feel\u00a0the financial squeeze. For some companies, the pressure point might be $45 US a barrel. For others, it could be in the $30s.\u00a0\n\"The Canadian sector really starts to feel the pain under $40 a barrel,\"\u00a0said Peter Tertzakian,\u00a0executive director of the ARC Energy Research Institute\u00a0in Calgary.\n\"But, I emphasize, it's not just Canadian oil and gas companies. This\u00a0is a global industry.\"\nIndeed, some commentators see the new price war as a way to target U.S. shale oil producers, which are already facing greater investor\u00a0scrutiny after spending big on\u00a0aggressive growth in recent years.\nCanada's oilpatch, on the other hand,\u00a0enters the fray\u00a0leaner, more efficient and innovative than five years ago when oil prices hit the skids. In many ways, the Canadian sector is \"battle hardened,\"\u00a0Tertzakian said.\n\"We, here, have really been innovating quite significantly, on average, and are better positioned than we were in 2014 to weather this,\" he said. \"But that's not to say that under $40 is going to be easy to take.\"\nThe most important, and most difficult, question to answer is how long will this\u00a0situation last.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to\u00a0the dispute between\u00a0Russia and Saudi Arabia, at least there's some history to lean on.\nTertzakian said price wars\u00a0\u2014 regardless of the industries involved\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have four phases: the\u00a0declaration of\u00a0war, the weeding out of high-cost participants, capitulation and, finally, a return to normal pricing.\u00a0\nHe doesn't expect either side to surrender for probably a quarter or two,\u00a0but no one can know for sure.\nReuters reported\u00a0the world's top two oil exporters each have war chests of\u00a0around $500 billion to weather economic shocks and are making\u00a0bullish noises about their stamina as they square up.\nMoscow said on Monday it could withstand oil prices of\u00a0 $25-$30 US per barrel for 6-10 years. Riyadh, meanwhile, can afford\u00a0oil at $30 US a barrel, but would have to sell more crude to soften\u00a0the hit to its revenue, according to Reuters sources familiar with the\u00a0matter.\nThe impact of the coronavirus\u00a0might even be more difficult to predict, with stresses on the health-care system, consumer behaviour, trade and the global\u00a0economy. All those things will affect oil consumption, as demonstrated by the steep drop in oil demand in China so far.\nThe\u00a0International Energy Agency\u00a0said this week that it expects global demand to drop this year for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008/2009.\nAs Alberta's premier,\u00a0Kenney, said Monday, \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/m_dragons/michele-romanow", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/dragons/michele-romanow", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "Hemosol delays trials, cuts staff", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hemosol-delays-trials-cuts-staff-1.343584", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": ["Jun 07, 2002 4:21 PM ET", "2002-06-07T20:21:28.000Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Hemosol Inc.
