The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.\nGross domestic product increased at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9 per cent pace estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0 per cent pace in the April-June period.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9 per cent.\nThe upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought, as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment. Inventories increased at a $79.8 billion US pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month.\nWhen measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4 per cent rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.\nSecond-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion.\nAfter-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6 per cent, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3 per cent rate in the second quarter.\nThe average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3 per cent rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter.\nU.S. stock index futures briefly extended gains and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose after the release of the data. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies.\nGrowth has slowed from the 3.1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year. The slowdown is largely blamed on the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment.\nThe fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year. But there are some hopeful signs for business investment.\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.\nWith consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.\nWages increased 0.4 per cent in October after climbing 0.1 per cent in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.\nWith spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September.\nOrders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2 per cent last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5 per cent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products and fabricated metals.\nEconomists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.3 per cent in October. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.\nCore capital goods shipments fell 0.8 per cent in September.\nBusiness investment dropped at a 2.7 per cent rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0 per cent pace as previously reported. The declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, were not as steep as previously estimated.\nA report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23. Claims had been stuck at a five-month high over the previous two weeks, pointing to some easing in the labor market.\nStill, the labour market remains on solid footing, helping to underpin consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.9 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada-s-debt-to-gdp-ratio-isn-t-a-major-election-issue-but-should-it-be-1.5327513", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": null, "title": "New Zealand plans spending spree to counter virus job losses", "description": "Finance Minister Grant Robertson unveiled a budget Thursday unlike any in nation's history", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-zealand-budget-1.5569118", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5569130.1589434734!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/new-zealand-budget.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 14, 2020 2:47 AM ET", "2020-05-14T10:49:58.433Z"], "source": null, "content": "New Zealand's government plans to borrow and spend vast amounts of money as it tries to keep unemployment below 10 per cent\u00a0in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nFinance Minister Grant Robertson on Thursday unveiled a budget unlike any in the nation's history. Debt would shoot up from just over 20 per cent of GDP to 54 per cent by 2023, and thousands of jobs created by putting people to work building homes and improving the environment.\nStill, the increased spending will not be enough to offset the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Unemployment is expected to rise from just over four\u00a0per cent\u00a0to nearly 10 per cent\u00a0by June. And Robertson acknowledged that tourism, which had accounted for about 10 per cent\u00a0of the economy, was not going to be the same for many years to come.\n\"We face a global economic and health crisis not seen since the Great Depression,\" Robertson said.\nThe budget was released on the same day the nation lifted most of its lockdown restrictions.\nMalls, retail stores and restaurants all reopened, and many people returned to their workplaces. That reflected the country's success to date in its attempts to eliminate the virus. Health authorities on Thursday reported zero new infections for the third day in a row. New Zealand has reported a total of about 1,500 confirmed infections and 21 deaths.\nUnder the budget plan, the government will spend 50 billion New Zealand dollars ($42\u00a0billion Cdn) over four years to help boost the economy.\nThe government had entered the crisis running a surplus and with its books in good shape compared to many other countries. Robertson said the crisis called for increased spending rather than cutting back.\n\"I'm not a fan of austerity,\" he said.\nMore than half of all workers in New Zealand are currently being subsidized by the government under a scheme that was quickly set up as the nation went into a strict lockdown in March. The budget would extend the scheme for hard-hit businesses.\nThe plan also calls for 11,000 environmental jobs to be created, some of them temporary. People would be put to work killing pests and restoring wetlands. And up to 8,000 new homes would be built, creating thousands of construction jobs. Spending would also be increased on everything from health care and education to school lunches and the postal service.\nLawmakers were expected to approve the budget later Thursday.\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1626791491581", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "John Paul Tasker", "title": "Federal deficit likely to be higher than $252 billion, parliamentary budget\u00a0officer says", "description": "PBO says it's possible federal debt will hit $1 trillion because of pandemic relief spending", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-deficit-higher-than-252-billion-1.5566768", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138746.1558027091!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/phoenix-pay-system.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 12, 2020 5:34 PM ET", "2020-05-13T17:44:54.995Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The parliamentary\u00a0budget officer (PBO) says the federal deficit likely will\u00a0exceed what he projected at the end of April as the federal government continues to spend billions of dollars\u00a0on COVID-19 support programs with no clear end in sight.\nSpeaking before the Commons finance committee Tuesday, Yves Giroux said the $252 billion figure he cited only a few weeks ago is a\u00a0low-ball estimate of\u00a0just how much the programs will cost the federal treasury this fiscal year.\nHe said Finance Minister Bill Morneau should provide a fiscal update soon to give Canadians a better sense of how much Ottawa is spending on the pandemic.\nThe $252 billion figure was based on the data the PBO had as of April 24. Since then, said Giroux,\u00a0new\u00a0aid programs have been announced for commercial rent support, the agricultural sector, students and seniors \u2014 things he called \"very expensive measures.\"\n\"I think $252 billion is on the very optimistic side, as things stand now,\" Giroux said.\n\"In all likelihood the deficit will be higher than $252 billion. If I had to bet on that number, I'd say it's more likely to be worse than that than better than that.\"\nAs a result, the federal debt will rise to more than $900 billion \u2014 or roughly $24,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada.\nGiroux said it's \"not unthinkable\" that the federal debt could reach $1 trillion, and it's\u00a0both \"possible and realistic\" that the debt could hit\u00a013 figures by this time next year.\nIn fact, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, it's possible that pandemic\u00a0programs could cost more than what the entire federal government\u00a0spent last year on everything \u2014 which was roughly $337.8 billion for the 2018-19 fiscal year.\nWatch:\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's full press conference for Tue.

Before the pandemic, the government projected a ratio closer to 30 per cent.\nWhile that figure is high, Giroux said it's still well below the 66 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio the country reached in the 1990s\u00a0\u2014 when the Wall Street Journal branded Canada \"an honourary member of the Third World.\"\nThe cost of financing this massive increase in government spending, and the resulting debt, will be relatively low, Giroux said. He said interest rates have hit rock bottom \u2014 the Bank of Canada's benchmark interest rate is now at 0.25 per cent \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the cost of servicing the debt will be manageable.\n\"We anticipate that debt charges will not go up, which is surprising and counterintuitive,\" Giroux said. \"Interest rates are so much lower than what we anticipated them to be just two or three months ago. It doesn't cost that much to finance that growing debt.\n\"Is the government in a worrisome position right now? The answer is no.\"\nHe said the debt load could become \"unbearable\" in the event of a sizeable spike in interest rates and added the prospect of such an increase is\u00a0\"concerning.\"\nThe Liberal members of the committee asked Giroux what the cost to Canadians would have been if the government hadn't\u00a0stepped in to flow funds to Canadians through programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy.\nGiroux said that, without government support, Canadians would have suffered considerable economic pain because of the pandemic.\n\"We would have seen widespread \u2014 and I mean widespread \u2014 bankruptcies at the individual and corporate level,\" he said. \"There would be lots of defaults on mortgages, repossession of homes and cars, credit card debts that would go unserviced.\n\"The cost of doing nothing would be high.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": "England tiptoes out of lockdown as economy dives", "description": "U.K. economy contracted by a record 5.8 per cent in March from February", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/england-lockdown-1.5567345", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5567352.1589365190!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/1224544629.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 13, 2020 7:30 AM ET", "2020-05-13T13:51:40.106Z"], "source": null, "content": "England tentatively began easing its coronavirus lockdown on Wednesday\u00a0with some people who cannot do their jobs at home urged to return to work, as stark economic data showed the disastrous impact of the pandemic.\nThe worst-hit country in Europe with more than 40,000 deaths from COVID-19\u00a0\u2014 including 275 health and care workers, according to official data\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Britain has been in lockdown since March 23.\nThe government is loosening restrictions only gradually\u00a0for fear of triggering a second peak of infections.

People have struggled to reconcile the advice to go to work with strong discouragement from using public transport, and with the lack of child care while schools remain closed.\nMany have also asked why people were not allowed to let friends and relatives into their homes, but are now authorized to allow prospective homebuyers in to view their properties.\n\"All those who talk about confusion or mixed messages are grossly overstating the position,\" Johnson said. \"The common sense of the British people is shining through ...

The lockdown message was very straightforward \u2014\u00a0it was just stay at home. Now as we start to unlock, of course, there have to be decisions made,\" Shapps said.\n\"There is no perfect way of doing this, and we'd ask people to use their common sense ... Right now, there has to be a cut-off somewhere.\"\nWorkers were being advised to avoid public transport if possible, and schools remained closed, prompting questions about how parents and people who could not get to work by other means should apply the new guidance.\nEmployers faced the daunting task of creating safe environments for staff, with detailed guidance on one-way systems at entry and exit points and in stairwells, spacing out workstations and other minutiae.\nFor those working from home or unable to work, there was little change. People were now allowed out to exercise more than once a day, and two people from separate households were allowed to meet outdoors if they kept two\u00a0metres\u00a0apart.\nFines for transgressions have been increased.\nAnyone hoping to alleviate the tedium by planning a summer holiday would be taking a risk, Shapps told the BBC.\n\"Right now you can't travel abroad.

At the start of the year, the federal debt was roughly $700 billion.\nBut Trudeau said today he has no immediate plans to table a budget because the government simply doesn't know how the economy will fare in the months ahead, as social distancing measures continue to cripple economic activity.\nHe also seemed to rule\u00a0out tabling some sort of document that could be updated as the fiscal situation stabilizes.\nTrudeau said the government is focused on \"immediate\" needs over long-term budgeting.\n\"A budget is usually something that projects what's going to happen to the Canadian economy for the next 12 months and right now, we're having a lot of difficulty establishing with any certainty what's going to happen in the next 12 weeks,\" Trudeau said today at his daily briefing with reporters.\n\"The situation is changing extremely rapidly.\"\nIn the midst of the 2008-09 global recession, the previous Conservative government tabled a budget in January 2009 and a fiscal update followed in September as the Tories responded to a cratering economy.\nWhen asked if there were any plans for a fiscal update this year, a spokesperson for Morneau said the department\u00a0had no comment beyond what Trudeau said at his press conference.\nConservative members pressed Morneau in the Commons today,\u00a0asking if the government had any projections of how much it would cost to finance the growing debt.\nMorneau said he will give a full accounting of the costs of the government's pandemic measures \"when we have the ability.\"\nThe PBO said the cost to service the debt will be manageable\u00a0for now,\u00a0because interest rates are at record lows \u2014 but a spike in those rates would be very \"concerning.\"\nWhile cabinet ministers have been reluctant to say if or when the next fiscal update will be released, a senior public servant told the Senate's national finance committee Tuesday that work is underway on such a plan.\n\"We're in the process of beginning that fiscal update, which, of course, involves consultation with the private sector, and we expect to be able to provide a fiscal update in the coming weeks,\" said Alison McDermott, an official in the economic and fiscal policy branch of\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Finance.\n\"I don't think the government has made any announcements about the timing of that at this point.\"\nKevin Page, the country's first PBO and the president and CEO of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said Morneau should produce a fiscal update by June to make\u00a0Canadians feel confident that the government has its fiscal house in order.\nPage said nobody is expecting a traditional 500-page budget \u2014 \"We're not in that\u00a0world right now, we get that,\" he said \u2014 but there's still a need for some sort of planning document. He said the prime minister should face pressure to release some numbers soon.\n\"It's pretty hard to say we don't need a fiscal strategy right now. The way to engender confidence is to be transparent,\" he told\u00a0CBC\u00a0News. \"I don't think they\u00a0can get away getting much past early June without a fiscal statement ... there's no accountability without a plan. We need to see a\u00a0tally.\"\nHe said people need to know if the government intends to continue programs like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy, and, if so, for how long.\n\"Just tell people \u2014 this is the situation, this is how we're going to respond. We need a strategy.\u00a0We need to tell people what to expect over the next few months,\" he said.\nSuch information is also important for would-be bondholders, Page said, who will be extending credit to a money-hungry government.\nSahir Khan, Page's former deputy PBO, said the government is probably reluctant to release numbers now because opponents could pounce\u00a0if the fiscal situation rapidly deteriorates.\nBut if health officials are expected to release modelling for COVID-19 infections and deaths, he said,\u00a0federal finance officials should do the same with deficit\u00a0spending and debt.\nAs spending continues unabated, former prime minister Stephen Harper voiced concerns Tuesday with the debtload much of the Western world has taken on in recent weeks in response to\u00a0this crisis.\nHarper, an economist by training, said balance sheets have become an \"unholy mess\" and some states are likely to face sovereign debt crises in the months ahead.\n\"If they fail to practice mild austerity proactively, a brutal kind will be thrust on them,\" Harper said in an op-ed published in the U.S.-based Wall Street Journal.\nHarper said \"leftists\" are trying to capitalize on this crisis to permanently expand the size of government by pushing ideas like a \"guaranteed minimum income.\"\n\"A new era of big government in the economy is unlikely, undesirable and far from inevitable,\" Harper said.\n\"When focus shifts from the pandemic to the economy, it will need to shift from a lot more government action to a lot less.\"\nBut Page, who was appointed by Harper, said now isn't the time to talk about austerity.\nHe said Canada is still in a strong fiscal position compared to\u00a0other industrialized nations,\u00a0with roughly half the average\u00a0debt-to-GDP ratios of other advanced economies.\n\"We're nowhere near code red,\" Page said, when asked if belt-tightening is needed now.\n\"If\u00a0you phoned someone from Washington, D.C. and told them Canada is hitting $1 trillion they'd say, 'Boy we wish we had your numbers,'\" Page said, citing the country's projected debtload.\nPage said that,\u00a0rather than austerity, the government should start talking about a stimulus package \u2014 measures beyond direct payments to Canadians. \"We have to take care of our citizens or else we'd be in a Great Depression-mode.\"\n"}, {"author": null, "title": null, "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1732957251767", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": null, "source": null, "content": null}, {"author": "Pete Evans", "title": "It's official \u2014 Canada's economy is in a recession, C.D.

Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council declared Friday.\nThe council, which monitors recessions and recoveries in Canada, said the economy peaked in February, just before drastic measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were implemented across the country.\n\"Members agreed that by applying the council's methodology to the preliminary data available, Canada entered a recession in the first quarter of 2020,\" the council said in a statement.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for declaring a recession, although one rule of thumb used by economists is that an economy is probably in one if it has shrunk for two three-month periods in a row.\nThe council rejects the \"two quarters\" rule and instead defines a recession as a \"pronounced, persistent\u00a0and pervasive decline in aggregate economic activity\" based largely on GDP and the job market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is still less than two months old in Canada, but the council said Friday that the slowdown is already so swift and deep that it's safe to declare a recession already.\n\"The council agreed the magnitude of the contraction makes it extremely unlikely that any future adjustments will overturn the conclusion of a major drop in economic activity in the first quarter,\" the council said.\nDeclaring a recession is always controversial, since there is no\u00a0unanimous view as to what qualifies as one. By the \"two quarters of economic decline\" definition, Canada had a brief, slight recession in late 2014 and early 2015, as the price of oil crashed.\nBut the Business Cycle Council still says\u00a0that slowdown didn't meet the\u00a0bar as an official recession by their metrics.\nIn the council's view, this is the first recession Canada has seen since the financial crisis that began in 2008. And the data suggests this one is on track to be quite a bit worse than that one.\nThe March jobs report showed more than a million jobs were lost in the month, while a preliminary estimate by Statistics Canada suggested the economy contracted by nine per cent in the same month. Those are\u00a0the biggest one-month plunges in jobs and GDP on record in Canada.\nWhile the decline in March was record-setting, economists expect the data for April will show an even bigger drop, with the measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus in place for the entire month.\nThe eight-person council, which normally meets once a year in December, decided to meet twice last month, once it became clear that something dramatic was happening to Canada's economy.\nStephen Gordon, an economics professor\u00a0at Universit\u00e9 Laval and member of the council, says the current economic slowdown is a great example of how the \"two quarters of contraction\" definition of a recession is too dogmatic.\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, he noted that if the slowdown had started in April as opposed to March, the entire first quarter would have been excluded. And since a rebound in the summer is quite plausible, that would make the current recession only one-quarter long\u00a0\u2014 deep though it may be.\n\"This episode would fail the two-quarter test, even though it's obviously a recession,\" he said.\nThe current episode is a good illustration why the the \"2 quarters of declining GDP\" definition of a recession is not a hard-and-fast rule. 1/\nStatistics Canada reported Thursday that economic growth had stalled going into the crisis, with real gross domestic product essentially unchanged in February due to teacher strikes in Ontario and rail blockades across many parts of the country.\nThe official estimates of GDP for March and the first quarter of 2020 will be released on May 29.\n"}, {"author": "David Cochrane", "title": "Deficit reduction will have to wait for the economic recovery, federal officials say", "description": "Federal aid programs could continue well into the recovery phase, says government official", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-pandemic-coronavirus-deficit-debt-1.5561513", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5561869.1588962494!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-consumer-motivations-20200507.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 09, 2020 4:00 AM ET", "2020-05-09T08:00:00.610Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "As the fallout from COVID-19 adds hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt, senior federal officials say there will be no aggressive attempts at deficit reduction until Canada's economic recovery is well underway.\nInstead, the immediate aim\u00a0will be to keep using the government's balance sheet to extend federal aid programs and eventually ramp up stimulus spending, instead of\u00a0trying to quickly reduce the deficit.\n\"I think [deficit reduction]\u00a0really can't happen until you know the full extent of the damage and until you get a measurement of what this did to us,\" said a senior federal official speaking on background.\n\"If you want to make this as painless as possible for people, you wouldn't rush it.\"\nThe federal deficit is ballooning due to the combination of multi-billion dollar aid programs and an economic slump that dwarfs any other recession in modern history.\nParliamentary Budget Officer [PBO]\u00a0Yves Giroux forecast the deficit for this year will amount to at least $250 billion \u2014 essentially more than a decade of the Trudeau government's annual deficits in a single year.\nAs troubling as those numbers are,\u00a0there are others that worry the government more.\nThe most recent data from Statistics Canada show that three\u00a0million Canadians\u00a0lost their jobs during the first stage of the pandemic. Millions more have lost most of their work hours. In total, 5.5 million people have either lost their jobs or have been working far less since the week of April 12.\n\"These numbers tell us what we already knew \u2013 that right now, Canadians are hurting because of this pandemic,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.\u00a0\nThe hurt likely goes even deeper than those numbers suggest.\nAlready, 7.7 million Canadians are getting\u00a0cheques\u00a0through the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, while 1.7\u00a0million workers have qualified for the federal emergency wage subsidy. \u00a0More than 45\u00a0per cent of the labour force is now receiving some sort of federal government support.\nWatch: The pandemic and essential workers\nEven as some provinces inch toward\u00a0reopening their economies, there are few signs of rapid economic improvement. The PBO's office projects the economy could shrink by as much as 30 per cent in the second quarter.\nIn a recent article for Policy Magazine, former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page said the staggering economic data left the government with two clear choices: run up the debt to help households and businesses and increase the odds of recovery\u00a0and longer-term growth \u2014 or offer less help, minimize debt growth and diminish the chances of recovery.\n\"All countries will wake up after the global pandemic with much higher debt levels. Canada is fortunate because we are starting at a much lower net debt-to-GDP level,\" Page wrote. \"If low interest rates are maintained, there is no good policy case for rushing to austerity \u2014 either spending cuts or tax increases. The economic recovery will likely be much too weak and fragile for austerity.\"\nFederal bureaucrats are in the middle of a review of pandemic-related aid programs, primarily to see if they need to be tweaked or extended. What could emerge from that process is what the senior\u00a0official described as a \"glide-and-launch phase,\" where some direct aid programs slowly wind down while economic stimulus programs are launched.\nTrudeau revealed\u00a0one of the first steps of that review on Friday when he announced that the wage subsidy program would continue beyond June to help kick-start the reopening of provincial\u00a0economies\u00a0and allow people to move from the CERB to paid work.\n\"We need an economy to come back to and direct support is a key part of that,\" said a finance official speaking on background.\u00a0\"Everything is going to be largely dependent on where we are and what the needs are.\"\nBut even as the federal government prepares for the next phase of its pandemic response, it's\u00a0still busy trying to deal with the first wave of challenges. The already-extended wage subsidy is still in the getting-money-out-the-door phase. There's also the\u00a0unfulfilled promise of direct financial help for seniors to address. And hard-hit sectors such as airlines, energy and hospitality will need some kind of sector-specific bailouts.\n\"The big business bailout is the hardest one to do out of all of them,\" said the senior federal official. \"How do you bridge people to a better time and what do you get in return for that?\"\nPart of the government's\u00a0concern here is the risk of being seen bailing out companies that use tax havens or engage in tax avoidance. There's a desire at the federal level\u00a0to make sure that any bailout includes a degree of public oversight and can support\u00a0the argument that it was done in the public's interest.\n\"We will, over the coming days, start looking at specific sectoral supports,\" Trudeau said Friday. \"But even then, our focus will be on the workers \u2026 and not on the corporate well-being of an industry or sector.\"\nAnd while airlines have been promised some sort of help, public transit companies are also knocking on Ottawa's door.\u00a0The Trudeau government is a big booster of mass public\u00a0transit and a big spender\u00a0when it comes to capital investment to boost transit capacity.\nBut transit operations are largely a municipal responsibility. Ottawa is trying to find a way to help that sector without becoming a long-term player in transit policy.\nAs this crisis continues, jurisdictional lines are blurring. Many municipal and provincial governments were in\u00a0precarious\u00a0financial situations going into the pandemic and will be even more\u00a0vulnerable as they emerge from it. The Bank of Canada already\u00a0has launched a multi-billion dollar program to buy provincial government bonds because provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador have had trouble borrowing on the open market.\nAll of this will require Ottawa's attention when the dust settles \u2014 and billions of dollars more in federal spending may be required. Senior Liberals are already conceding they may need to go slower and be less aggressive on their campaign commitments, because the virus\u00a0has presented them with an urgent new\u00a0set of priorities.\n\"We are not yet talking about stimulus,\" Trudeau said. \"We are still very much in the support and emergency phase right now.\"\nBut the costs will keep growing. We still have no clear idea of how much this will cost the country. And the government's view is that it's still too early to talk about paying the bill.\n"}, {"author": "Jordan Press", "title": "Federal deficit could top $252 billion, says budget officer", "description": "PBO report assumes real GDP will contract by 12 per cent this year", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-deficit-covid-1.5550498", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5138746.1558027091!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/phoenix-pay-system.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 30, 2020 10:21 AM ET", "2020-04-30T17:03:05.669Z"], "source": null, "content": "Parliament's budget watchdog says it's likely the federal deficit for the year will hit $252.1 billion as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014\u00a0and could go even higher if emergency measures remain in place longer than planned.\nThe figure is an estimate based on the almost $146 billion in spending measures the government has announced to help cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, estimated declines in the country's gross domestic product\u00a0and the price of oil remaining well below previous expectations.\nParliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux's report assumes real GDP will contract by 12 per cent this year\u00a0and help push the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 48.4 per cent.\n\"To date, budgetary measures announced by the government are intended to be temporary.

Many employees who could were sent to work from home, while others were laid off or had their hours slashed.\nSo far, more than seven million people have received federal emergency aid through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which has paid out more than $25.6 billion in benefits, based on the latest federal figures.\nThe Liberals have budgeted $35 billion for the CERB, which pays $2,000 a month for up to 16 weeks to anyone whose income has dropped below $1,000 a month. Giroux's report estimates the measures will end up costing the government $35.5 billion.\nA more detailed note explaining the figure, published separately this morning, estimates the CERB will end up reaching 8.5 million people.\nBut the note warns the estimates are \"highly sensitive\" to the course the economy takes over the coming months, as well as the spread of COVID-19. And some of the spending will depend on how\u00a0the program interacts with a new wage subsidy program that begins payments next week.\nGiroux also estimates the wage subsidy program will cost $76 billion, slightly more than the $73 billion price tag the Liberals have put on the measure.\nThe subsidy will cover 75 per cent of employee salaries, up to $847 a week,\u00a0for 12 weeks, retroactive to mid-March and through to the start of June.\nIn a costing note specifically about the subsidy, the PBO says the cost of the program will depend somewhat on the behavioural response of employers.\n"}, {"author": "Jesse\u00a0Hajer and Lynne Fernandez", "title": "Austerity and COVID-19: Manitoba government creating, not solving, problems", "description": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-government-economy-covid-19-1.5539666", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5539238.1587498532!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/covid-mba-20200415.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 4:24 PM CT", "2020-04-21T21:24:17.437Z"], "source": null, "content": "COVID-19 has upended communities and economies across the globe. Canadian political leaders have taken unprecedented steps to slow the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of non-essential businesses, schools and universities. These measures, while necessary, have led to a severe drop in economic output and employment.\nIn response, governments in Canada, as elsewhere, are intervening in economic affairs in a manner not seen in generations.\nThe scale of the crisis and its exposure of woefully inadequate social safety nets\u00a0has led to even established conservative voices calling for a permanent growth of the role of government in the economy.\nThe approach of the Manitoba government has been restrained compared to other Canadian jurisdictions, particularly with economic measures and supports aimed at low-income Manitobans and workers who have lost their jobs.\nMany of the economic measures announced to date have taken the form of tax and payment deferrals, as opposed to flat-rate cash benefits that have played a role in the federal response.\nThis week, the provincial response appears to be moving from lacklustre to straight-up counterproductive.\u00a0\nTwo sets of austerity measures aimed at cutting provincial costs are planned: the first is reducing the employment and wages of public sector workers, with a target of $500 million (but under some scenarios discussed, that number would be as high as $900 million).\nThe second measure is to cut spending by $750 million through other spending control mechanisms. This has involved directing government departments to compile lists of service providers funded by the province, for the purposes of making cuts to these organizations.\nThe lack of support and cuts are in stark contrast to the way other provinces are responding. The Manitoba response is the opposite of what standard economic theory would suggest in a recession.\nMaintaining government employment and spending supports the overall \"aggregate demand\" for goods and services. This demand creates sales for businesses and supports jobs.\nEconomists statistically quantify these effects with multipliers reflecting how $1\u00a0in spending in the economy leads to more than $1 in economic activity, because that spending is revenue for someone else, and in turn stimulates more spending/revenues, etc.\nThe opposite is also true, with spending cuts having negative ripple effects throughout the economy. This is a big part of the reason the government of Canada has come up with several programs to flow money to Canadians during this crisis.\u00a0\nWe can use multipliers to estimate the overall impact of the proposed government of Manitoba cuts on labour incomes, income tax revenues and economic activity in Manitoba.\nTo cut public sector employment, the government is proposing a federal work-share program where \"non-essential\" government workers would be reduced to working two or three days a week, while the federal government would pay benefits for the remaining two or three days at 55 per cent of salary, up to the maximum annual insurable earnings of $54,200.\nFor the public service as a whole, we estimate they will keep on average 67 per cent and 78 per cent under the two scenarios.\nUsing the multiplier approach, we estimate that the combined impact of the proposed work-share program and $750 million in additional cuts will result in:\nThe provincial government claims that COVID-19 expenditures and lost revenue will require a $5-billion increase to the provincial deficit, pushing us to the edge of a looming \"fiscal cliff.\"\nThis $5 billion fear-mongering assumes that the monthly deficit increase being experienced now will continue for the entire fiscal year.\nThis is not consistent with economic forecasts that predict the impact to be concentrated in one or two quarters of 2020, as social distancing measures are gradually relaxed.\nAs a comparison, the $5 billion works out to approximately $3,650 per Manitoban, while all of New York state, with\u00a0a current infection rate 70 times that of\u00a0Manitoba, is\u00a0estimating a fiscal impact of $770 US per person.\nEven giving the province the benefit of the doubt on the questionable $5 billion estimate, what would be the actual impact of fully funding this $5 billion deficit through government borrowing?\nThis is an important question, as the government should be borrowing at this time.\nOur debt is currently at $26.7 billion. The most widely accepted measure of the effect of debt on the economy is the debt to GDP ratio (debt/GDP).\nGoing into 2020, GDP was around $74.8 billion, so our debt/GDP was 34.3 percent. Although this is higher than what it was 10 years ago, it is a perfectly manageable ratio.\nThe $5 billion extra debt will put our debt up to $31.7 billion.\nWe know that our economy, like every other economy in the world, is going to shrink. Assuming a 3.1 per cent reduction, our GDP could fall to $72.5 billion.\nThat will bring our debt/GDP to 44 per cent. A 44 per cent debt/GDP ratio is underwhelming given the enormity of the crisis we face. In fact, this new ratio is still less than some other provinces had in 2017.\nThere are also two moving parts to the debt/GDP ratio:\u00a0if the Manitoba government spends and allows the debt to increase, the economy is stimulated, increasing GDP. Shoring up Manitoba's economy now will increase our capacity to weather the crisis, rescue our businesses, grow in the future\u00a0and repay the debt later.\nHow much of a difference would this borrowing actually have on our debt servicing charges?\nAssuming we were to borrow the $5 billion at Manitoba's going rate of 3.2 per cent for a 30-year bond, we would incur debt servicing charges of $260 million/year. Dramatic as this number sounds, the PST cut in 2019 cost us $330 million in annual revenues.\nOnce the economy recovers, we can look at new taxes on high income earners taxes and reverse tax cuts, if necessary, to manage the debt.\nIt seems as if Premier Pallister thinks the real crisis is one of provincial government debt, whatever the amount turns out to be\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not the hardships people and businesses are facing as they lose customers, jobs, wages and security.\nThe premier insists that we need all hands on deck to deal with this calamity, yet is unwilling to commit his government to do its part.\nWhere our economy lands when we come out of the pandemic depends on him stepping up to the plate sooner rather than later. That includes using government borrowing for necessary expenditures rather than putting that burden on the backs of workers and business and, as a consequence, dealing the economy another blow.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

In order to prevent the collapse of the economy, aggressive fiscal and monetary policy become the order of the day.\u00a0\nThe Manitoba government, though, appears to disagree with the weight of historical evidence, preferring to focus on the costs to the provincial treasury rather than costs of the government's lack of action on the lives of Manitobans.\u00a0\nAs economist Joseph Stiglitz put it, when you are at war, you don't ask \"Can we afford it?\"\u00a0\nIn 1930, as the Great Depression took hold in the U.S., President Herbert Hoover infamously made the depression worse by focusing on balancing the budget. As the Great Depression wore on, deficit spending became widely accepted as a remedy to mitigate the crisis (as historian Michael Horn put it, \"only government could keep hundreds of thousands of Canadians from starving or freezing to death\").\nBut the spending was too parsimonious to actually end the Depression.\u00a0\nWhen the Second World War began, government spending expanded significantly, essential to winning the war and finally getting us out of the Great Depression. At the end of the war in the U.S. and Canada, the debt-to-income ratio rose to historic levels \u2014 in 1946, Canada's debt was 109 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nIt declined over the next few decades while the economy prospered not because anxious post-depression governments cut public spending, but in part because they spent taxpayer dollars to develop our modern health and education sectors, making productive investments in infrastructure and research.\nRather, the government used the resulting growth in GDP to pay down the debt over time. Keynesian economics 101.\u00a0\nIn the 2008 Great Recession, the opposition parties forced Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to pass a massive fiscal stimulus package to prevent unemployment and bankruptcy. The Bank of Canada contributed tens of billions of dollars to shore up our financial system.\nThe Bush and Obama administrations in the U.S. did the same to stave off a potential repeat of the Great Depression. In the early days of the crisis, conservative Republican George W. Bush argued that without a government bailout of the financial sector, \"this sucker could go down.\"\nThe treasury bailed out the financial system and Obama's $800-billion stimulus bill extended unemployment benefits, rebuilt roads and bridges, prevented teacher layoffs and provided temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy. For economists like Paul Krugman, while the stimulus prevented a deeper decline in the economy, it should have been much larger.\nIn the current pandemic crisis, Prime Minister Trudeau is clearly paying attention to these lessons of history by ensuring the needy will not freeze in the dark, that the federal public sector maintains its workforce and wages, and that businesses and their workers will get support.\u00a0\nHe understands that without this kind of government support, huge structural problems with the economy will prolong the pain well beyond the end of the pandemic.\u00a0\nLike Hoover, though, the Pallister government is rowing in the opposite direction by pursuing its long-standing desire to reduce the size of the government with plans to cut funding for charities and non-profit organizations, the public sector and the universities.\nThe province is threatening to lay off workers and cut wages in the middle of the pandemic.\nThus far, the provincial government's underwhelming support measures consist of hiring a local firm to set up a call centre to help Manitobans access federal money and a program to give eligible small businesses $6,000 each, neither of which suggests a government committed to addressing the massive economic downturn caused by the crisis.\nEconomists Jesse Hajer and Lynne Fernandez estimate that the proposed cuts would reduce provincial GDP by between $1.3 and $1.5 billion. Members of Manitoba's business community have described the province's approach as \"penny wise and pound foolish.\"\nAs Stiglitz suggests, such cutbacks in jobs and funding \"will show up in the unemployment statistics, but the deeper effects \u2014 on our economic growth and social fabric \u2014 won't be fully apparent for years to come.\"\u00a0\nNo other government in Canada has done more to damage \u00a0our future with less economic justification than the government of Manitoba.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Asper School professor Shiu-Yik Au perceptively pointed out, while Ontario and Quebec face greater health costs from the pandemic, both provinces have taken much greater responsibility to help their citizens.\u00a0\nAmong its actions, Ontario increased payments to low-income seniors\u00a0and families with children, and funded Indigenous communities and municipalities. In Quebec, the government has provided emergency support to small and medium businesses, the tourism industry, and workers.\u00a0Both of these provinces have higher debt-to-GDP levels than Manitoba.\u00a0\nAusterity has failed as an economic strategy wherever and whenever it has been tried. The Pallister government is rowing against the tide of history, creating lasting damage for Manitobans to clean up for years to come.\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

But the bank also said there's no\u00a0point in releasing a formal forecast for the second quarter.\n\"The outlook is too uncertain at this point to provide a complete forecast,\" the bank said in its policy announcement Wednesday.\nScotiabank's House said recessions\u00a0normally play out over multiple quarters. \"In this case, we are compressing the downturn into one [quarter].\u00a0Which means the sharpness is particularly pronounced. And that's why we're getting these record numbers.\"\nWatch: COVID-19 will hit the economy hard\u00a0\nThe historic numbers, the breakneck speed of the downturn,\u00a0the job losses\u00a0centred in the labour-intensive services sector, the unpredictability of the virus\u00a0and the long-term effect\u00a0on consumer behaviour all make the COVID-19 recession unlike any other seen in modern economic history. All of those factors also make it next to impossible to determine how long it will take to recover.\u00a0\n\"Economists for the first time ever are making their economic predictions based off of medical predictions. That's creating a fog of uncertainty,\" said Frances Donald, chief economist and head of Macro Strategy at\u00a0Manulife\u00a0Investment Management.\n\"And it's leading major central banks, including the Bank of Canada, to throw up their hands and say 'forecasting? We just can't do it.'\"\u00a0\nThere are\u00a0a slew of\u00a0other new indicators pointing to the unprecedented nature of the economic downturn.\nNormally, Statistics Canada releases monthly GDP data 60 days after the period ends. But the pandemic prompted the agency to produce what it calls a flash estimate of GDP for March on Wednesday, even before\u00a0several indicators for February are released.\u00a0\nStats Can said\u00a0its estimate indicates a decline of approximately\u00a09 per cent\u00a0in March,\u00a0the largest one-month decline in GDP\u00a0since the series started in\u00a01961.\nWATCH |\u00a0IMF lauds speed, generosity of donor countries in helping poor countries sideswiped by COVID-19\nCanada is also being hammered by collapsing oil prices, caused by a price war between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Russia, but made exponentially worse by world lockdowns.\nA report by the\u00a0International Energy\u00a0Agency (IEA) released Wednesday\u00a0said global demand for oil will drop by a further 29 million barrels per day\u00a0in April, a record decline\u00a0back to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. The IEA also said the buildup of unsold oil from the first part of the year \"threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry \u2014 ships, pipelines and storage tanks \u2014 in the coming weeks.\"\nCOVID-19 also caused Canadian home sales to plunge 14 per cent in March. But even that number is out of date.\nConsider early numbers for Toronto, Canada's largest real estate market, show a drop in listings of 64 per cent in the first two weeks of April\u00a0and sales down a staggering 80 per cent.\u00a0\n\"The people who are in the marketplace are serious buyers but just the sheer volume has dropped off significantly,\"\u00a0said Cailey Heaps Estrin, managing director of Heaps Estrin Real Estate in Toronto.\nShe said\u00a0they have had a number of\u00a0sales including one this week with three bidders that sold for more than $100,000 over asking. But she said\u00a0they're not proactively going out and bringing listings to market.\n\"We are having video meetings with people getting ready to launch their listings once the [lockdowns]\u00a0are lifted.\"\u00a0\nBut even when travel and social distancing restrictions are relaxed, few economists expect the overall economy to immediately spring back to life.\n\"It's pretty easy for us to turn a manufacturing plant back on and have widgets come out on a conveyor belt,\" said Manulife's Frances Donald. \"It's a lot harder to tell people 'go shake hands, go to a movie theatre, sit in a restaurant' when they still feel their personal safety is at risk.\"\u00a0\n\"This recession, the length of it, is really going to be dependent on the evolution of the virus.\"\n"}, {"author": "Sean Kavanagh", "title": "Wage reductions, more layoffs for City of Winnipeg workers part of worst-case COVID-19 scenarios", "description": "City comes up with action plans for 3 possible outcomes of coronavirus pandemic", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-covid-economic-analysis-layoffs-wages-1.5539511", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3720306.1471143662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winnipeg-city-hall.JPG", "publishedAt": ["Apr 21, 2020 11:50 AM CT", "2020-04-21T22:50:20.209Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "The City of Winnipeg has released three\u00a0scenarios and three possible courses of action to contend with the financial implications of COVID-19.\nThe grimmest would see the city negotiate temporary wage reductions for all employees, lay off more staff and drain cash from some of\u00a0its\u00a0reserves.\nThat worst case is\u00a0something Mayor Brian Bowman hopes will be avoided.\n\"There [are] some pretty ugly things in those tiers as you get further down\u00a0to Tier 3\" in the city's scenarios, Bowman said Tuesday.\n\"We hope we are not in a position where we have to consider those, because hopefully the economy is in a position where it is doing what it should be doing, and we hope to see supports from other levels of government.\"\nThe municipal government has already laid off more than 650 temporary workers and frozen some spending.\nThe city is also already poised to reduce transit service in April, finance some capital projects instead of using cash, and freeze wages for non-union staff.\nThe latest fiscal\u00a0outline is included in a presentation to the city's finance committee, which is scheduled\u00a0to meet next Monday.\nThe report looks at three possible scenarios for the economic impact of the health crisis.\nIn the first, the assumption is made that\u00a0COVID-19 remains a public health issue through the summer of 2020, social distancing measures begin to end by September and gross domestic product (GDP)\u00a0contracts 3.1 per cent\u00a0in 2020 and then grows 2.5 per cent in 2021.\u00a0\nThe second\u00a0projects\u00a0a second wave of COVID-19 beginning\u00a0in December 2020 and social distancing measures once again being put in place until April 2021.\u00a0GDP contracts 3.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020 and then grows 0.8 per cent\u00a0in 2021.\nThe third and most dire scenario is based on a more severe\u00a0second wave of COVID-19 that hits the economy even harder. Social distancing measures stay in place until May 2021, non-essential businesses are shuttered and\u00a0there is another global economic slowdown.\u00a0\nIn the worst-case scenario, GDP contracts 3.5 per cent in 2020 and a further one per cent\u00a0in 2021.\nEven the best-case scenario predicts\u00a0unemployment levels over 10 per cent in 2021 and at worst\u00a015.6 per cent that\u00a0year.\nThe report says the city's goals through the economic fallout from COVID-19 (beyond maintaining essential services such as police and fire) are\u00a0to \"sustain employment both privately and publicly\" in the short term and \"be prepared to identify major shovel-ready infrastructure projects\" in the long term.\nThose projects would be financed by either the provincial or federal governments.\nBowman says the commitment to maintain the city's capital spending on roads, sewers and other infrastructure\u00a0is \"incredibly important to the economic recovery.\"\nThat got support from the Business Council of Manitoba, whose\u00a0members have grown increasingly concerned about how a recovery would take shape.\n\"The important thing with infrastructure is you get something for your money,\" said business council president Bram Strain.\u00a0\n\"So you're not giving a subsidy, you're not giving out tax deferral.

You've improved the\u00a0sewer, you've improved the utility system.\"\nRegardless of which scenario unfolds, the city's revenue will drop\u00a0significantly and its\u00a0fiscal stabilization fund will be used\u00a0to make up for the lost income.\nThat's led to the suggestion of other cuts, such as\u00a0trimming back the Winnipeg Transit schedule. Bowman told reporters Tuesday a decision on that was due soon.\nThe head of the Amalgamated Transit Union says the city should find ways to deploy staff rather than making cuts.\n\"Service cuts at this point will hurt the local economy in the short\u00a0and long term, and could result in the city losing experienced personnel,\" said\u00a0ATU 1505 president Romeo Ignacio.\n"}, {"author": "Shiu-Yik Au", "title": "Austerity is the wrong path for Manitoba during coronavirus pandemic: U of M professor", "description": "'We can't afford not to help those around us,' says Asper School of Business assistant prof Shiu-Yik Au", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/opinion-cornavirus-manitoba-economy-austerity-1.5534427", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5534540.1587055876!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/empty-winnipeg-streets-covid-19.jpg", "publishedAt": ["Apr 16, 2020 3:19 PM CT", "2020-04-16T20:19:00.779Z"], "source": null, "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a tumultuous time for both the health and wealth of all Manitobans.\nHowever, Premier Brian Pallister's and Mayor Brian Bowman's\u00a0dangerous plans to reduce non-essential government spending\u00a0during this pandemic \u2014\u00a0such as laying off workers or reducing government pay to just two days a week\u00a0\u2014\u00a0will badly damage our economy.\nThe 2008 financial crisis showed that a better plan is to increase spending during this pandemic.\nPeople often falsely use the analogy of a province or country being akin to a family \u2014 if a family has less income, then it should cut back on its expenses.

But the pandemic and the subsequent global economic shutdown have not\u00a0slowed down Canada's efforts to secure a seat at the UN table.\nThe bid instead has been redirected toward organizing or chairing virtual global conferences the Trudeau government sees as\u00a0demonstrating Canada's global\u00a0leadership in a way that could win\u00a0more votes.\n\"The best campaign is when we don't need to campaign, when we just show our leadership, that this is the type of voice that you would want at the Security Council,\" Foreign Affairs Minister\u00a0Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told CBC News.\nCanada is in a tight fight with Norway and Ireland for the two non-permanent seats\u00a0out of 10\u00a0on the 15-member council that are reserved for Western countries.\nMost experts think Norway has a lock on one of those seats, leaving Ireland and Canada to duke it out for the other one (even though Canada entered the race late).\nBut the Liberal government now\u00a0sees an opportunity. Champagne said he believes Canada's international standing has grown in 2020, and not only because of its response to the pandemic. The minister also\u00a0is banking on a boosted\u00a0profile because of Canada's role in coordinating efforts to investigate the destruction of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was\u00a0shot down over Iran in January, killing all 176 passengers and crew.\nChampagne points to the fact Canada is a member of both the G7 and G20, unlike its competitors, and argues that status allows the government to bring other leaders together and \"amplify the voice of other nations\" that are more vulnerable in the current health crisis.\nAnd the pandemic itself also could cut the cost of Canada's\u00a0campaign\u00a0for a Security Council seat,\u00a0which already has set the government back $2 million.\n\"We do a lot of things virtually these days, so it allows us to reach more people without having to go very far,\" Champagne said.\nCritics were questioning the Trudeau government's Security Council campaign even before the global pandemic upended government agendas around the world. Now, the government is saying\u00a0Canada needs\u00a0to be at the big\u00a0table to have a say in how the world recovers from the pandemic \u2014 even though\u00a0the Security Council has been relatively silent on the crisis to date.\n\"It's also in our very selfish national interests that the recovery in other parts of the world is as strong as possible,\" said Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations\u00a0Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard, who has been working behind the scenes on the campaign.\n\"This is a table where the entire world wants to be, because when you're around that table you're more influential and you're more relevant.\"\nStill, the factors that made Canada's bid look like a long shot before the pandemic arrived are still in play: a faltering peacekeeping commitment and relatively low foreign aid commitments.\n\"Ireland has been peacekeeping since 1958. It's never stopped,\" said Stephen Lewis, a former Canadian ambassador to the\u00a0UN\u00a0who is closely following the race.\n\"Our failure on that front is our most serious Achilles heel in seeking the seat.\"\nThe pandemic has allowed Canada to boost its presence on the international stage. Trudeau participated Monday in an\u00a0online pledging conference to raise funds for vaccine development,\u00a0spearheaded by the European Union. While\u00a0Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg pledged more than $1 billion US\u00a0for vaccine development and eventual distribution, Trudeau pointed to $850 million Cdn Canada already had committed to accelerated vaccine development.\nThat $850 million includes $74 million that's part of the $159.5 million foreign aid package Canada's international development minister announced in April. Ottawa says it's only a beginning.\n\"This takes a global effort,\" Trudeau said Monday at his daily briefing. \"There will be more to come as the world grapples with this pandemic.\"\nStill, Lewis said Canada's international funding\u00a0commitment maintains the same level of aid Canada has\u00a0always\u00a0offered, and the Liberal government needs to work harder to match\u00a0its \"rhetoric with performance,\"\u00a0particularly when it comes to the pandemic.\nCanada gives about 0.26 per cent of its GDP in foreign aid. Norway, the world's most generous donor, gives 1 per cent of its GDP.\nThe old way of winning\u00a0a Security Council seat \u2014 having the prime minister or other high-profile ministers show up in foreign capitals to schmooze\u00a0\u2014 is \"a bit of a sham,\" said Lewis.\u00a0The vote is a secret ballot and the ambassadors who cast the votes don't always follow orders from the top.\nLewis said the popularity of Canada's ambassador could\u00a0tip the scales, however.\n\"Marc-Andr\u00e9 Blanchard is the real key to this [campaign],\" he said. \"He's really first-rate and that does not happen often.\"\nGlobal Affairs Canada is campaigning as though the vote will go ahead on June 17, but there is pressure from some nations to postpone it until the fall, given the logistics involved in having 193 representatives of member states vote online.\n"}, {"author": "Alex Soloducha", "title": "Many Sask. restaurants might permanently close due to COVID-19", "description": "Owner of two Regina restaurants says business is down 90%", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/many-sask-restaurants-might-permanently-close-due-to-covid-19-1.5560661", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5560689.1588896405!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/tony-yang.jpg", "publishedAt": ["May 07, 2020 7:03 PM CT", "2020-05-08T01:03:50.509Z"], "source": "CBC News", "content": "Many Saskatchewan restaurants have temporarily closed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yang hopes it will reopen someday, but he said he's not sure if that will be possible.\u00a0\nHe said about 25 employees have been laid off between both locations and some of his kitchen employees are now working as delivery drivers.\nWith last month's\u00a0income, Yang said Wann is just breaking even. He has pushed some bills and is working every day to cut down on labour costs.\u00a0\nHe said he's staying afloat through government subsidies and a break on rent.\u00a0\n\"It's just really hard for a small business like me to make any profit anymore.

The date for that phase is not yet set and is dependent on the success of the first two phases.\u00a0\nYang said 50 per cent won't allow for enough customers to make a typical profit, and without help from the government and\u00a0his landlords, he might be worse off.
