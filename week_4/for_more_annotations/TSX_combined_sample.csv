0,Bloomberg News,Divya Balji,Red-hot Canada stock rally comes to halt with reality sinking in,"After seven dizzying weeks of gains, Canada’s stock market is at an impasse.",,,,,2020-05-16,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/red-hot-canada-stock-rally-comes-to-halt-with-reality-sinking-in-1.1437234,,"After seven dizzying weeks of gains, Canada’s stock market is at an impasse. 
 Two back-to-back days of heavy losses this week was enough to snap the S&P/TSX Composite Index’s winning streak as health officials warned on premature reopenings, Wall Street heavyweights called for caution and trade tensions between the U.S. and China heightened. 
 Investors wagering on negative interest rates may be getting ahead of themselves as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and other central bankers dismissed going below zero. The Fed also issued a stark warning Friday, just as the market closed, that stock and other asset prices could suffer “significant declines” should the coronavirus pandemic deepen. 
 “We’ve effectively moved from the ‘shock and awe’ phase associated with massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to the ‘aw, shucks’ phase when investors recalibrate to the potential difficulties associated with containing and recovering from the global pandemic,” said Kurt Reiman, who sets strategy for the Canadian arm of BlackRock Inc. 
 
 Case in point: Asian economies that have seen some of the most success quelling the coronavirus are now facing resurgences. It’s a painful reminder that as countries open up again and people resume normal life, flare-ups are likely. Closer to home, Quebec had to push back the time frame to restart the economy in Montreal as the city and its suburbs became Canada’s biggest COVID-19 hotspot. In contrast, Ontario announced it would begin to reopen most stores, except for those in shopping malls. 
 The S&P/TSX Composite gained Friday, but was down 2.2 per cent for the week, trimming its gains to 30 per cent from the low on March 23. 
 “It’s normal to see a pullback in markets in any environment, especially given the highly uncertain backdrop created by he COVID-19 pandemic,” said Lesley Marks, chief investment officer at BMO Private Wealth. “Investors are realizing that even though there is optimism for a recovery with easing restrictions globally, the recovery will be slow and not necessarily be a smooth path upward.” 
 Reiman noted the uneven performance of various industries. Both growth and defensive sectors, like tech, utilities and consumer staples, had stronger earnings and returns in Canada and globally. Cyclicals like energy and financials experienced sharp earnings downgrades and dividend cuts. 
 Markets: Just The Numbers 
 Stocks 
• Financials, real estate and utility stocks led the declines on the TSX for the week, offset by tech and materials. 
 Bonds 
• The Canadian 10-year bond yield rose to 3.18 per cent, while two-year bond yields climbed 3.95 per cent. 
 Loonie 
• The Canadian dollar weakened by more than one per cent against the U.S. dollar this week. 
 Getting Defensive 
 While markets may have priced in the bad economic data released so far, there’s more to come. 
 “Our view is that in the coming months, we’re probably not going to see the same level of policy responses and announcements,” Craig Basinger, chief investment officer at Richardson GMP, said. “It’s hard to keep throwing a trillion dollars every month at the market. And at the same time, we’re going to start getting more bad more economic and earnings data.” 
 Basinger said he has reduced exposure to stocks in his funds and has tilted to a more defensive view. Second quarter-earnings results will be “anyone’s guess,” added Chris Kerlow, portfolio manager at Richardson GMP. 
 Blackrock’s Reiman prefers U.S. stocks for their greater exposure to companies with strong balance sheets and hefty U.S. fiscal and monetary-policy measures. He also prefers corporate bonds over stocks for higher and more stable income stream. 
 Chart of the Week 
 
 Economy 
 As far as the Bank of Canada is concerned, the country’s financial system remains resilient in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and moves to keep credit markets functioning have been largely effective, though risks remain. The central bank’s balance sheet grew to $416.6 billion, about 18 per cent of Canada’s gross domestic product. 
 Consumer confidence is showing signs of improving as Canadians’ views on their personal finances, job security and expectations for the economy all improved. 
 Earlier this week, Justin Trudeau’s government unveiled a loan program for large companies with annual revenue of $300 million or more that have been hit by COVID-19 and can’t get financing by conventional means. Firms in all sectors can apply for the funding except the finance industry. 
 Politics 
 The world’s longest undefended border will likely remain shut until late June, according to a newspaper report. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a media briefing this week that Canada will be “very, very careful about reopening any international travel including the United States.”

1,Bloomberg News,Jacqueline Thorpe,Shopify leapfrogs Brookfield to become No. 3 stock in Canada,A furious rally in Shopify Inc. has vaulted the e-commerce retailer to the third-largest company in Canada -- underscoring the value of the virtual world in the time of the coronavirus.,,,,,2020-04-17,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/shopify-leapfrogs-brookfield-to-become-no-3-stock-in-canada-1.1423154,,"A furious rally in Shopify Inc. has vaulted the e-commerce retailer to the third-largest company in Canada -- underscoring the value of the virtual world in the time of the coronavirus. 
 Shopify soared as much as 10 per cent to a record on Friday after its Chief Technology Officer Jean-Michel Lemieux said in a tweet that the Ottawa-based company was handling “Black Friday level traffic every day!” as it brings “thousands” of businesses online. 
 The move extended a seven-day surge to almost 50 per cent, giving it a market value of about $92 billion. That put Shopify, which provides tools for companies to sell over the internet, behind only Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank as the biggest companies in Canada’s stock market. 
 Investors now see more value in Shopify than Canadian companies that have been around for decades: Brookfield Asset Management Inc. with its billions of dollars worth of real estate, infrastructure and renewable power across the world, as well as pipeline giant Enbridge Inc., Canadian National Railway Co. and Bank of Nova Scotia. 
 With more consumers shifting online, Shopify is getting a leg up while the value of retail malls and office towers are being questioned, even in a post-viral world.

2,Bloomberg News,Claire Ballentine,ETF investors are all-in on stimulus with US$17 billion stock bet,"As stocks posted their biggest weekly gain since 1974, skeptical Wall Street veterans shook their heads in amazement. But exchange-traded fund investors did what they always do -- they piled in.",,,,,2020-04-13,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/etf-investors-are-all-in-on-stimulus-with-us-17-billion-stock-bet-1.1420891,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1420892!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/a-pedestrian-wearing-a-protective-mask-walks-past-the-nasdaq-marketsite-in-the-times-square-neighborhood-of-new-york-photographer-jeenah-moon-bloomberg.png,"As stocks posted their biggest weekly gain since 1974, skeptical Wall Street veterans shook their heads in amazement. But exchange-traded fund investors did what they always do -- they piled in. 
 In only seven trading days this month, equity ETFs took in more than US$16.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The torrid pace puts inflows on track to exceed the monthly total of US$42.5 billion in December, when stocks rallied during what ended up being the tail end of an 11-year bull market. 
 The surge in stocks last week, when U.S. shares gained a combined US$3.2 trillion, represents a bounce after the S&P 500 Index cratered 30 per cent in March. Optimists -- including mom-and-pop investors who use ETFs -- are focusing on massive fiscal and monetary stimulus meant to offset the impact of the pandemic, even as analysts predict one of the biggest economic contracts in U.S. history and the worst earnings season ever seen. 
 One explanation is that investors are already looking past the next two quarters after the S&P 500’s rapid decline of more than 30 per cent in March, and are now focusing on the recovery and the economic support supplied by the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. It’s a narrative that ETF investors, especially retail ones, have followed for duration of the sell-off. 
 “We saw a lot of emotional selling at the beginning of the outbreak, and it was mostly in very liquid vehicles,” said Chad Oviatt, director of investment management at Huntington Private Bank. “When you go back to risk on, you will start to see more flows into equity vehicles whether that’s ETFs or mutual funds.” 
 ETFs used by allocators, which are typically longer-term retail investors and advisers, added US$41.1 billion in the first quarter, while those favored by professional traders lost almost US$27 billion. Vanguard equity fund flows, popular with mom and pop, are up almost 6 per cent year-to-date. 
 
 
A big contributor is the health care sector, which leads equity ETF flows with almost US$3 billion added, as drugmakers race to find a cure for the new coronavirus and companies rush equipment to hospitals. 
 State Street’s Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLV, posted a record inflow of almost US$1.9 billion on Wednesday, while BlackRock’s iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, ticker IHI, saw its biggest one-day inflow on record Thursday, adding US$578 million. 
 Still, a worse-than-expected earnings season or more negative news on the virus spread could quickly reverse the inflows. Bank of America Corp. analysts said it would be unparalleled if the stock market fails to retest lows. 
 “A lot of investors are looking at these moves and saying, are we going to test the lows?” said Lance McGray, head of ETFs at Advisors Asset Management. “If we do make a move lower, I think you could see some potential outflows. The next week or two are going to provide some color in terms of where we go.”

 The blue-chip index tumbled 23 per cent in the three months, closing the period with a 1.9 per cent drop. The S&P 500 fared little better, even after a furious, weeklong 17 per cent rally that halted Tuesday. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell least among major indexes, as dip-buyers targeted the cash-rich tech megacaps that make up its core. 
 There was almost nowhere to hide for Dow investors, as all but one of the 30 members ended lower for the year. Boeing plunged 54 per cent, while Chevron and Exxon sank at least 39 per cent after oil suffered its worst quarterly beatdown on record. Microsoft fared best, ending higher by 0.01 per cent. 
 Risk assets around the world tumbled in the period as governments instituted unprecedented shutdowns in large swaths of the global economy to combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Massive government spending and monetary stimulus lifted U.S. stocks from a rout that reached 33 per cent, but the hit to GDP is shaping up to be monumental, with Goldman Sachs now forecasting a 34 per cent contraction in the second quarter before a sharp rebound. 
 As March ends, here are some of the major quartlery moves: 
 
 The record bull market in U.S. stocks turned into a bear market on March 12, 11 years and three days after the last one ended. 
 Bloomberg’s U.S. dollar index surged six per cent, most since 2016, even after tumbling more than three per cent since March 23. 
 The Cboe Volatility Index averaged 57.1 in March, triple the mean in the prior decade. 
 European shares plunged more than 20 per cent for the worst three months since 2002. Spain lost 30 per cent. 
 West Texas oil lost 65 per cent, the worst quarter on record. 
 The 10-year Treasury yield hit 1.94 per cent on Jan. 20. It fell to 0.31 per cent by March 9 and is just over 0.6 per cent now. 
 Gold topped US$1,700 in early March before plunging US$200 an ounce. It’s on track for a sixth quarterly gain. 
 China’s Shanghai Composite lost 10 per cent, while Tokyo’s Topix fell almost 20 per cent in its worst three months since 2008. 
 Copper fell 23 per cent and nickel lost 19 per cent, both most since 2011. 
 The pound fell more than six per cent, while the yen was virtually flat versus the U.S. dollar. 
 South Africa’s rand had its worst quarter since 2001 and Mexico’s peso fell the most since 2008. 
 
 On Tuesday, investors focused on signs that Congress could deliver a fourth round of stimulus as the virus spreads deeper in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking a US$2 trillion infrastructure package. Treasuries edged higher, while the U.S. dollar fell and crude pushed back above US$20 a barrel. 
 Investors are at a crossroads, questioning whether extraordinary stimulus by countries and central banks can counter further retrenchment of firms and consumers as the outbreak spreads. 
 New York City, which is emerging as the new epicenter of the pandemic, reported a 16 per cent increase in deaths in six hours. Italy and the Netherlands are considering extending lockdowns, and Spain’s 849 deaths were the most in one day for the country. 
 “The recent market movements do reflect efforts to factor in what has happened on the pandemic control side of things and the stimulus measures,” Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, said by phone. “It’s almost certain that we’ll continue to see volatility.” 
 In Europe, the Stoxx 600 rose and a measure of corporate-credit stress eased. Equities were mixed in Asia, where China had stronger-than-anticipated manufacturing data. The U.S. dollar rose versus the euro. 
 In China, the official purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.0 this month. That’s up from a record low of 35.7 in February and above the 50 mark which signals improving conditions. Still, the country’s bureau of statistics cautioned that the single-month data didn’t necessarily mean that economy has returned to normal level amid continuing coronavirus concerns. 
 These are the main moves in markets: 
 Stocks 
 
 The S&P 500 Index fell 1.7 per cent as of 3:20 p.m. New York time. 
 The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 0.2 per cent. 
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.6 per cent.

11,Bloomberg News,Divya Balji,BMO’s Belski sees Canada profit melting before big stock bounce,"One of Canada’s staunchest bulls is cutting his profit forecast for the country’s S&P/TSX Composite Index by 10 per cent but is keeping his year-end target in place -- at more than 5,000 points higher from here.",,,,,2020-03-16,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bmo-s-belski-sees-canada-profit-melting-before-big-stock-bounce-1.1407033,,"One of Canada’s staunchest bulls is cutting his profit forecast for the country’s S&P/TSX Composite Index by 10 per cent but is keeping his year-end target in place -- at more than 5,000 points higher from here. 
 Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, cut his earnings per share target to a “bear-case scenario” level as the oil price shock and a coronavirus lead to mounting concerns about a recession. 
 “While we continue to believe the economy, markets and earnings will recover from the shock of the coronavirus (Covid-19 virus), there is no denying the fundamental impact of lower oil prices on the overall Canadian earnings environment,” Belski said 
 The bank cut its 2020 earnings target to $1,020 from $1,140, said chief investment strategist, Brian Belski in a report published Monday. 
 Belski isn’t revising his target on the S&P/TSX level, which sits at 18,200. The benchmark index fell 8.4 per cent as of 3:25 p.m. in Toronto on Monday to 12,570.14. Belski upgraded real estate stocks to overweight from market weight, maintains energy and financials at overweight. 
 “While investments, let alone society, have been gripped by the fear of the lasting effects of Covid-19 virus, we firmly believe this too shall pass and remain committed to perspective and analytically driven messaging as opposed to fear-laden headlines and the natural impulse to react,” Belski said. 
 Canadian stocks entered a bear market last week and are now down about 30 per cent since their peak in February. 
 The BMO strategist has had a knack for nailing year-end forecasts for Canadian stocks. Last year, he predicted the benchmark would end the year at 17,000, about 63 points from where it actually ended. His forecast for the S&P/TSX in 2017 was only 1%, or about 200 points below the final closing number. Belski’s 2016 forecast was even more spot on, coming within just 12 points, or 0.1 per cent, of the close. 
 In 2018, his estimate was off by a wide margin as Canadian stocks careened toward their biggest annual plunge since the 2008 financial crisis, ending the year more than 3,000 points, or 22 per cent, below his forecast.

 Bourses operated by TMX Group Ltd. halted trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time as coronavirus anxiety enveloped global markets and accelerated an afternoon sell-off. 
 The exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group’s website. In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26. 
 All systems are now ready for the start of business Friday, TMX Group said. The interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX’s trading engine. The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack. 
 If trading had continued for all of Thursday, the rout may have deepened in the nation’s equity market. The biggest U.S.-listed ETF for Canadian stocks, iShares MSCI Canada ETF, closed 2.2 per cent lower. 
 South of the border, S&P 500 plunged 4.4 per cent Thursday, its worst day since 2011, taking equities into a correction. American depository receipts of Canadian companies slumped in U.S. trading -- Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Enbridge Inc., making up more than 15 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, plummeted in New York. 
 Futures contracts on the S&P/TSX 60 plunged as much as three per cent on Friday. This comes as the global market tumult continued with stocks across Europe and Asia nosediving and investors sought safe assets, sending Treasury yields to new depths. 
 Canadian stocks had been holding up fairly well at the start of the outbreak buoyed by safe-haven gold producers. But with the economic impact of the virus spreading, the nation’s market lost over $132 billion value since the slump began last week as the 30-year government bond yield dropped to a record low and the loonie weakened. 
 “Our concern is that the disruption of the supply chain doesn’t just get switched on again,” Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X Management said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. It can take weeks to get back on track and that’s why the coronavirus is especially detrimental to the miners and resource companies that populate Canadian exchanges.

 TMX Group will be left with a “black eye,” Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities Ltd. and chairman of the rival Canadian Securities Exchange, said in a phone interview. “It’s a terrible thing to happen, particularly in a cataclysmic market that we’re currently experiencing this week that people either want to trade, need to trade, want to get out or want to get in.” 
 Toronto-based TMX had said in a series of tweets that clients were not able to enter, modify or cancel any open orders on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture and TSX Alpha exchanges. At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives.

 High Volume 
 The halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem. 
 In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41% higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26. 
 “I don’t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,” said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television. 
 TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange. 
 
 To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. “Volume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,” Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues “but it’s not impossible to trade,” she added. 
 TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module. 
 Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. “Rest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,” he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission. TMX will likely be asked what measures are being put in place so it doesn’t happen again, he added.

Volatility has spiked. And investors have been piling into government bonds, pushing yields to near-record lows. 
 Anxiety is everywhere for investors in the nation’s markets as the coronavirus outbreak and protests that hobbled rail traffic are magnifying concerns about an economic slowdown. 
 The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost this year’s gain in just four days of trading -- it is down 0.1 per cent in 2020. It had been up 5.2 per cent as of last Thursday’s close. 
 A technical indicator that measures buying strength versus selling strength -- known as the Bloomberg Fear and Greed indicator -- slumped to the lowest level since the global market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 The coronavirus continued to spread across the world as new clusters of cases have emerged in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams confirmed Wednesday a new positive case of the virus in Toronto, taking the number of infections in Canada to more than 10. 
 Meanwhile, environmental and indigenous-rights activists have obstructed rail lines across Canada for weeks to protest the construction of TC Energy Corp.’s CUS$6.6 billion (US$5 billion) Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. That has paralyzed parts of the nation’s rail network in recent weeks, bringing grain movement to a near halt. 
 Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday. 
 Belski isn’t so worried. “While the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.” Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.

 'Overdue correction': Stocks extend slide as virus fears weigh 
 Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, says we're seeing an “overdue correction” in the markets as North American indices continue to fall on coronavirus fears.   
 
 Market turbulence has surged. At one point this week, volatility on the S&P/TSX soared to its highest level since Aug. 26. For the loonie, three-month implied volatility rose to the highest in almost four months as virus fears sparked demand to hedge the Canadian dollar’s weakness. 
 The loonie may continue to fall. Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. and Monex Canada Inc., said that “currency markets may be lining up for another serving of a Poloz special –- talking the currency down in order to do the bank’s bidding in the short-run, thus buffering the Canadian economy from slowing global growth headwinds.” 
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends going long on the Japanese yen against the Canadian dollar as currency markets enter a “longer period of virus-related uncertainty,” strategist Zach Pandl said in a note to clients Wednesday. 
 His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, “dollar bloc” currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year. 
 In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That’s another indicator of economic concern. 
 An aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1.4 per cent year to date, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. on Wednesday, even as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
 For Baskin Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Barry Schwartz, long-term fundamentals are what count. “My advice to investors is the following. If you are a long term investor, you should do nothing or use the opportunity to improve your portfolio,” he said in a tweet Wednesday.

27,Bloomberg News,"Divya Balji, Danielle Bochove and Shelly Hagan",Virus fallout hits Canadian stocks after second confirmed case,Investor anxiety that’s swept the globe over the coronavirus extended to Canadian stocks and the loonie after a second person in Toronto tested positive for the illness.,,,,,2020-01-27,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/virus-fallout-hits-canadian-stocks-after-second-confirmed-case-1.1379656,,"Investor anxiety that’s swept the globe over the coronavirus extended to Canadian stocks and the loonie after a second person in Toronto tested positive for the illness. 
 Volatility on the S&P/TSX Composite Index spiked as stocks posted their biggest drop since October, joining a world-wide equity rout. The loonie weakened against the greenback and Canada’s two-year and 10-year bonds rallied for a fifth straight day. 
 With two infected patients in Canada’s most populous city, concern is rising about the speed with which the virus has spread beyond China. The province of Ontario, which includes Toronto, is monitoring 19 other potential cases of coronavirus. Its similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -- a disease that killed 44 in Canada, the highest number of deaths outside of Asia -- has both heightened fears and served as a reminder that the country is in a much better position to deal with a pandemic than it was 17 years ago. 
 “Panic is the biggest risk,” said Rebekah Young, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, by phone. “When you actually look back at SARS where Canada was an epicenter, the overall economic impact was negligible. It was a very-short lived impact and in a big picture, not that bad.”

 For the nation’s stock market, it’s a tale of two moves: gold miners surged Monday as investors piled into haven assets, while industrial metal miners slumped as the price of copper and iron ore sank on concerns that global growth could slow. Teck Resources Ltd. dropped for a third day, to its lowest since July 2016. 
 Air Canada slipped for a fifth day, taking its plunge to about 12% over that stretch, the biggest drop since June 2016. The airline reported quarterly losses during the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic as travelers avoided Toronto. 
 
 Canada Goose Holdings Inc. fell four per cent and Gildan Activewear Inc. slipped two per cent. Both clothing companies could see a decline in earnings. 
 Ballard Power Systems Inc., the fuel-cell manufacturer that gets more than 30 per cent of its revenue from China, fell as much as 9 per cent 
 Imax Corp., a Mississauga, Ontario-based company listed in the U.S. that gets more than 30 per cent of its revenue from China, extended last week’s drop, for a six-day decline of about 15 per cent. 
 
 A major spread of the disease couldn’t come at a worse time for the nation’s economy, which is emerging from what may have been its weakest growth since 2016 at the end of last year. Any rebound this year could be tempered if the disease spreads into the North American country, economists said. 
 Economists at Scotiabank estimate that a similar outbreak to the 2003 SARS epidemic could dent the economy by just over 0.1 per cent on the level of GDP by mid-2020. 
 While trader jitters seep into market sentiment, some are saying buy the dip. Jefferies industrials research team said in a report that the knee-jerk reaction within the metals and mining sectors could be an opportunity to pick up stocks amid the sell-off. During the spread of SARS, the initial reaction was sharply negative for metals and mining equities but the sector rebounded sharply afterwards, which could be the case for coronavirus, the analysts said.

 Canada Virus Update 
 The wife of the man who was identified as Canada’s first confirmed case was infected by the virus, Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams said in a statement Monday. She has been in self-isolation since arriving in Canada’s largest city with her husband last week. 
 Over the weekend, Williams confirmed that the woman’s husband -- a man in his 50s -- had tested positive for the SARS-like illness. The man, who had travelled from Wuhan, China via Guangzhou, arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and went to Sunnybrook hospital the following day after feeling ill. The patient is in stable condition, officials said Saturday. 
 
 
 
 From what we know, Wuhan novel coronavirus transmits through close contact—and there’s no closer contact than a husband and wife. While this new case has been in self-isolation, we're monitoring the situation as efforts continue to contain the virus.  https://t.co/wdE5XuMuU3 
— Christine Elliott (@celliottability)  January 27, 2020 
 
 
 Officials will be contacting flight passengers who were within 2 meters of the patient aboard the flight from Guangzhou to Toronto. Minister of Health Patty Hajdu spoke to reporters in a press briefing Sunday to reiterate the risk to Canadians still remains low. 
 “While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health-care professional if you’ve traveled to an affected area of China and develop flu-like symptoms,” Hajdu said from Ottawa. 
 On Jan. 23, the World Health Organization stopped short of calling coronavirus a global health emergency, saying it remains a local crisis confined to China. However, with millions of people set to travel over the Chinese New Year, other nations are taking their own steps to slow the spread of the disease. 
 There are 2,804 confirmed cases worldwide and at least 80 deaths as of Jan. 27.

28,Bloomberg News,Divya Balji and Kevin Orland,"Farewell Encana, hello Brookfield Property in Canadian index rejig","The time has come for Canadian index investors to say goodbye to Encana Corp., a stalwart of the nation’s energy sector with roots going back to the late 1800s.",,,,,2020-01-23,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/farewell-encana-hello-brookfield-property-in-canadian-index-rejig-1.1378497,,"The time has come for Canadian index investors to say goodbye to Encana Corp., a stalwart of the nation’s energy sector with roots going back to the late 1800s. 
 On Friday, shares of the oil and gas company will be removed from the S&P/TSX Composite and S&P/TSX 60 indexes after it won investor approval to relocate to the U.S. and rebrand under the name Ovintiv. While Encana will leave a hole on the key stock gauge, Brookfield Property Partners LP will replace it on the large-cap index, according to a statement from S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
 “This could possibly be the largest index event for the Canadian market,” Bryan Chuah, an analyst at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report. About 195 million Encana shares will need to be sold by Canadian indexers — valued at about $1.1. billion, he said, as its new U.S. domicile makes it ineligible for inclusion up north. Encana has about 1.3 billion shares outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 Encana shares have been in a downward spiral for more than a decade. In 2009, the company spun out its oil-sands assets into Cenovus Energy Inc. in a bid to unlock shareholder value and focus on natural gas. That didn’t work so well, as a glut of North American gas production has weighed on prices ever since. 
 
 Chief Executive Officer Doug Suttles, who took the reins in 2013, shifted the company away from gas production and into shale oil, especially in Texas’s Permian Basin. Its market value has tumbled about $63 billion to $6.7 billion since its 2008 peak. 
 In comes the real estate arm of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
 Units of Brookfield Property, a global real estate company, have rallied almost 10 per cent this year to market value of $25.8 billion. Prior to this addition, the S&P/TSX 60 had zero representation in the real estate sector. 
 Encana announced last year that it will move its head office from Calgary to Denver to allow access to larger pools of investment capital, including U.S. index funds and passively managed accounts. 
 Oil-Sands Gloom 
 The company may be added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in the U.S., generating demand for 90 million or more of the company’s shares, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in a note last week. 
 Encana’s move south only intensified the gloom enveloping the Canadian energy industry after foreign companies sold more than $30 billion of assets in the past three years amid a lack of pipeline space that has choked off prospects for growth. 
 Encana joins pipeline owner TransCanada Corp., which changed its name to TC Energy Corp. earlier this year, in dropping the link to Canada from its name. 
 Encana traces its history to the 1880s, when the Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. accidentally discovered natural gas while drilling a water well for workers. The company was eventually spun out from Canadian Pacific and took the name EnCana in 2002.

29,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Kristine Owram,Canopy Growth's venture capital arm is ready to pounce if U.S. legalizes marijuana,"Canopy Rivers has to steer clear of U.S. investments for now, but that's not stopping the firm from being plugged in to opportunities in the industry",,,,,2018-11-19,https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/canopy-vc-arm-ready-to-pounce-if-u-s-legalizes-marijuana,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bruce-linton.jpg,"Canopy Growth Corp.’s venture capital arm is barred from investing in the U.S. pot market, but its founders are ready to take advantage of “the most compelling opportunity in the history of capitalism,” if federal laws change.Like many of its peers, Canopy Rivers Inc. has to steer clear of U.S. marijuana investments because its Canadian listing requires that issuers comply with federal laws in the jurisdictions where they operate. Although cannabis is legal in several states, it remains illegal at the federal level.But co-founders Sean McNulty and Peter Hatziioannou say regulatory reform is already underway and they are keeping tabs on potential U.S. opportunities through XIB Consulting Inc., their outside consulting firm.“If Canopy Rivers could invest its own capital into the States, you would see one or both of us go all in on Canopy Rivers,” McNulty said in an interview at the company’s Toronto office. Because it can’t just yet, the company keeps itself “very plugged into other ideas, competitors and opportunities” through XIB, he added.McNulty and Hatziioannou, who met on the M&A advisory desk at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and have worked together on and off for over a decade, created XIB in 2016 to provide advisory services to a sector that had plenty of entrepreneurs but little capital markets experience.Canopy Growth was XIB’s first client and quickly became a large portion of its business. The Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company is worth $10.8 billion (US$8.2 billion), making it the world’s second-biggest marijuana company by market value. However, McNulty and Hatziioannou found they were turning down investments because Canopy was only interested in companies it could own and operate.“We decided to create a separate vehicle where we would could take minority interests, create alternative transaction structures and provide both growth capital and strategic support,” McNulty said.That vehicle became Canopy Rivers, which is about 25 per cent owned by Canopy Growth and counts chief executive officer Bruce Linton as its acting CEO and chairman. Canopy Rivers listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in September via a reverse takeover after raising $104 million in a private placement. It closed Friday with a market value of $685 million, down 54 per cent since it’s listing on Sept. 20.Canopy Rivers’ portfolio consists of 11 companies including Civilized Worldwide Inc., a cannabis media and lifestyle brand, LiveWell Foods Canada Inc., a nutritional company that sells hemp products, and Canapar Italy, a firm that works with Sicilian farmers to cultivate hemp.Another holding, a Canadian licensed producer called TerrAscend Corp., will give Canopy Rivers an indirect entree into the U.S. market that could act as a model for future U.S. investments.TerrAscend wants to expand into the U.S. market through acquisitions and is able to do so because it’s listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, which allows U.S.-focused pot firms. However two of its largest shareholders, the Canopy companies, wouldn’t be able to remain shareholders because of their exchange restrictions. To solve this problem, the two Canopys agreed to convert their common shares in TerrAscend into exchangeable shares, which can’t be transferred or monetized and aren’t entitled to voting rights or dividends. If U.S. federal law changes, they can be converted back into common shares.“It was important for us to try to make sure that we maintained our investor base and kept them happy,” TerrAscend CEO Michael Nashat said in an interview. “We see the U.S. market as the next big boom and now we can pursue this opportunity.”If the arrangement is approved by TerrAscend shareholders, which is expected to happen by the end of the month, it could set a compelling precedent for other U.S.-related transactions, McNulty said.Meanwhile, there are no shortage of other investment opportunities for Canopy Rivers to consider.“The deal flow is sometimes overwhelming,” McNulty said. “We’ve evaluated hundreds and hundreds of opportunities but we’re very picky because we’re trying to get it right for every investment.”Bloomberg.com"

Canada’s biggest engineering and construction company said it “strongly disagrees” with the government’s position and is reviewing appeal options.The rejection of settlement talks increases the threat to SNC’s business, especially if the graft allegations hang over the company’s reputation and impair its ability to win new construction contracts. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged SNC in 2015 with attempted bribery and fraud related to projects in Libya. The builder said at the time that it would “vigorously” defend itself.“This is a surprise,” said Chris Murray, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital in Toronto. An unwillingness by prosecutors to negotiate an agreement “prolongs the uncertainty around the timing of the conclusion of this matter,” while “raising questions around SNC’s ability to bid on future federal government contracts.”SNC sank 14 per cent to $44.58 at 3:01 p.m. in Toronto after sliding as much as 15 percent for the biggest intraday decline since February 2012. SNC’s drop was the largest on the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which fell 1.6 per cent.SNC would risk becoming a takeover candidate if its stock swoon is prolonged, Murray said.“If the company continues to trade at depressed valuations, it may be forced to look at strategic alternatives,” he said.The public prosecutor’s office determined that the criteria for remediation agreements set out by the country’s criminal code “were not met,” said spokeswoman Nathalie Houle, in response to questions about SNC. She didn’t elaborate.Canada recently adopted a system, similar to mechanisms in other Group of Seven nations, that allows companies to defer prosecution in exchange for fines, remediation and cooperation. SNC had hoped to use the system, saying it allows for the “fair, effective and globally competitive resolution of issues for Canadian corporations.”Since 2012, SNC-Lavalin has taken steps to improve its ethics and compliance while overhauling its senior leadership team. Chief Executive Officer Neil Bruce told analysts in August that the company was “optimistic” about being invited to settlement talks by prosecutors.Absent an agreement, SNC will probably proceed through the court system to fight the criminal charges, which could take “several years,” Derek Spronck, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.If the company is found guilty, the SNC units that are charged would be barred from bidding on Canadian government contracts for 10 years and “face a fine that would not exceed the benefit acquired from the illegal activity,” Spronck said.The Mounties have indicated that the benefit was $150 million to $200 million (US$115 million to US$150 million), Spronck said.Bloomberg.com"

It was dethroned earlier this week as the largest publicly traded pot company by British Columbia-based Tilray Inc., which has soared to a market capitalization of about $20 billion after going public a mere two months ago.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce led the deal with GMP Securities LP and Eight Capital, marking the first time a major Canadian bank helped a cannabis company gain a listing on a Canadian exchange.“We’re really trying to make this smart money that goes global,” Bruce Linton, chief executive officer of Canopy Growth and acting CEO of Canopy Rivers, said in an interview. “The scouting has been pretty active.”Canopy Rivers works to identify strategic partners seeking financial or operating support with Canopy Growth’s group of companies. Canopy owns about 25 per cent of the equity and just under 90 per cent of the votes due to a dual class structure.The company has made 11 investments in the past 12 months, including 10 in Canada and one in Italy that range from licensed marijuana producers to media platforms, Linton said. There’s a “wild deal flow” of pitches to the company and Rivers evaluates all options for potential investment, Linton said.Bloomberg.com"

The software-services company, which began trading Wednesday on the TSX Venture Exchange, traded at 44 cents at 9:45 a.m. in Toronto, up 193 per cent from its private placement price of 15 cents a share. It listed via a reverse takeover under the symbol MTLO.Linton shares the chairmanship with Terry Matthews, who has founded or funded dozens of tech companies including Mitel Networks Corp., which agreed to be acquired earlier this year by Searchlight Capital Partners in an all-cash deal worth about US$1.35 billion. Linton has known Matthews for about 30 years.Martello had a market value of about $75.6 million based on 171.9 million shares outstanding at the close of the RTO. Canopy, then known as Tweed Marijuana Inc., had a market value of about $29 million when it began trading in April 2014.Acquisitions will be Martello’s primary focus now that it’s publicly traded, said Linton, who was CEO of the company for six years before handing the reins to John Proctor, former vice president of global cyber security at CGI Group Inc.“Our revenues were growing, the number of targets we could buy was increasing and the cost of our currency was too high when we were private,” Linton said in a phone interview Tuesday. “We’re now at the stage where we can go public and then we can make more acquisitions at a lower cost per shareholder and a higher certainty for the companies we’re buying.”Linton said Ottawa-based Martello has looked at “somewhere north of 60 entities,” signed non-disclosure agreements with 18 to 20 of them and has narrowed that down to a list of seven or eight potential takeovers.Martello’s technologies manage and optimize communications network performance. The company, with 61 employees, reported second-quarter revenue of $1.9 million and a loss from operations of $1.1 million.Bloomberg.com"

They still can’t outperform U.S. banks on the stock market.Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada and the nation’s other six large lenders collectively boosted profit 10 per cent to a record $11.7 billion (US$8.9 billion) in the fiscal third quarter. Still, that’s no match for a U.S. economy seen having more runway than Canada’s, thanks in part to Donald Trump’s tax cuts.Canada’s S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has gained 13 per cent in the past 12 months, lagging the 21 per cent increase of the U.S. KBW Bank Index.“Canadian banks are run well and everything, but where they’re sitting in our view is not as attractive as where our U.S. banks are in terms of opportunity,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research and portfolio manager with Seattle-based Smead Capital Management.U.S. banks are well positioned for a lending revival fuelled by a strong U.S. economy and a millennial generation approaching their homebuying years — an emerging opportunity as lending in Canada slows, Scherrer said. “They’re ripe and ready and able to lend, but we’re in the very early innings of seeing those animal spirits kick in.”U.S. banks — and even some Canadian ones with U.S. operations — are also getting a boost from U.S. tax cuts signed into law in December. The lower tax rates are expected to fuel annual profit gains at Wall Street’s biggest banks by more than US$10 billion. Lower tax rates helped the six giant U.S. banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley — churn out more than US$29 billion in net income in each of this year’s first two quarters.Canadian bank executives cite economic reasons for the disconnect. The U.S. economy is expected to expand 2.9 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year, outpacing forecasts of 2 per cent for Canada this year and 1.9 per cent in 2019, according to economists.Uncertainty surrounding the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement may be weighing on Canadian stocks, along with lingering fears about the country’s housing market and overindebted consumers, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said in an interview.“I think all of those things would weigh on Canadian stocks relative to U.S. stocks,” Glass said.U.S. investors, who learned hard lessons a decade ago during the U.S. subprime debacle and financial crisis, may be spooked by the rapid growth of mortgages and loans at Canadian banks that fueled overheated housing markets and contributed to near record levels of household debt, according to Edward Jones & Co. analyst Jim Shanahan.“Although the banks continue to put up these amazing numbers, the stocks never really get away from us because of just broader concerns in the market,” Shanahan said in a phone interview from St. Louis. “There’s an undercurrent of fear in the U.S. as it relates to dramatic growth in residential real estate lending, because we lived through it and it was horrible.”Still, it’s hard to ignore the superiority of the Canadian banks on measures such as return on equity and profit margins. In these areas, Canadian lenders including Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and CIBC are clear winners.Canadian bank shares are more expensive than those of U.S. lenders, having fetched a premium over U.S. lenders for a dozen years. The Canadian banks index is trading at about 2.4 times tangible book value per share versus 2.0 times for the KBW Index of U.S. lenders.“The U.S. economy has been performing very well for the last few years and they’ve had a slightly less difficult regulatory environment to deal with. So it’s normal that they’ve been catching up,” National Bank of Canada’s Chief Executive Officer Louis Vachon said in an Aug. 29 interview.A longer-term view tells a different story, he said. Over a 10 or 15 year period “Canadian banks are quite a bit ahead,” said Vachon, the longest-serving of the current crop of Canadian bank CEOs.Executives such as Royal Bank’s CFO Rod Bolger say they’re more focused on running the bank than its stock performance.“If you grow earnings and you grow dividends and if you grow book value per share, which we’re doing, the stock price over the long term will move in tandem with that,” Bolger said.–With assistance from Joelle Kruczek.Bloomberg.com"

The lab will initially be used to test Hawthorne’s lights and nutrients on cannabis, but it hopes to eventually study pot genetics and its impact on human physiology.“Pretty quickly we realized that cannabis and hydroponics were a big opportunity,” said Chris Hagedorn, general manager of Hawthorne and the son of Scotts Chief Executive Officer Jim Hagedorn. “It has become more acceptable to our investor base, to our board, to our management team and the motivation is obvious: it’s a high-growth category.”Scotts joins a growing list of large companies testing the marijuana waters. Constellation Brands Inc. announced the biggest investment in the sector to date last week, paying US$3.8 billion for a 38 per cent stake in Canada’s Canopy Growth Corp. Molson Coors Brewing Co. and Heineken NV have also made initial forays.Global consumer spending on pot may reach US$32 billion by 2022, according to U.S. research firm BDS Analytics. Canada is gearing up to become the first G7 country to legalize the drug for recreational use on Oct. 17 and its use is spreading around the world.U.S. federal law prevents Port Washington, New York-based Hawthorne from touching the marijuana plant so it’s been testing its cannabis-cultivation products on proxy crops like tomatoes and flowers. Still, the company generates about 90 per cent of its sales from the cannabis industry, not including its AeroGrow indoor-gardening business.“We’re forced to go through this flawed process, selling products without testing them on the actual crops,” Hagedorn said. “Cannabis is such a complex and poorly understood plant at this phase of its evolution that it doesn’t seem super satisfying to test it on petunias.”Flowr’s president and co-founder Tom Flow was also a co-founder of MedReleaf Corp., which was acquired by Aurora Cannabis Inc. in July for about US$2.2 billion in stock. He brought several members of the MedReleaf team to Flowr, which is focused on producing consistent, high-quality plants that don’t need irradiation to deal with mould or pests — qualities that appealed to Hawthorne. The research facility will be built on the same site as Flowr’s grow-op in Kelowna, British Columbia.“They know all the big players, and they chose our team because of their faith in us to grow consistent product,” Vinay Tolia, incoming CEO of Flowr, said in an interview on the sidelines of a cannabis conference in Toronto last week.Flowr is aiming to generate some of the highest crop yields in the industry. Its grow-op is already producing 250 grams a square foot and is targeting an eventual yield of 450 grams, said Steve Klein, co-founder and chairman of Flowr. By contrast, Klein estimated that the industry average is closer to 100.Flowr, which will list on the TSX Venture Exchange next month via a reverse takeover, has signed supply agreements with the Ontario and B.C. governments ahead of legalization. It also has an agreement with a distributor in Germany to sell medical marijuana there next year, and is looking at opportunities in the Caribbean and South America.For Scotts and Hawthorne, a presence in cannabis helps to offset the seasonality of their traditional gardening business.“It’s a lot of things that Scotts’ core business isn’t: it’s West Coast, it’s younger, it’s male, it’s non-seasonal,” Hagedorn said. “Having a counterpoint to all of those things was really appealing to us.”Bloomberg.com"

The deceleration ends CIBC’s three-year streak of outpacing Canada’s other large lenders on mortgage growth. Royal Bank of Canada said this week that mortgage balances were 5.9 per cent higher than a year earlier.CIBC executives said in May that domestic loan growth would “moderate” in the second half of the year, with Canadian banking head Christina Kramer estimating that it would fall to “low-single-digits” by year-end. Her forecast was less than Canada’s other big lenders, which have maintained “mid-single-digit” growth expectations for the year.Despite the mortgage slowdown, CIBC posted a 16 per cent jump in Canadian personal and commercial banking earnings due to a “significant” expansion of deposit margins and growth in credit cards and unsecured loans amid rising interest rates, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said.“Those would be the major offsets in terms of mortgage growth declining,” Glass said in a phone interview. “Mortgages are a key product for us — it’s very important from a client relationship perspective — but it’s not a high margin product, so if mortgages come off it has a far smaller impact than rate increases do, for instance.”CIBC has the greatest relative exposure to Canada’s housing market, with a higher percentage of earnings coming from domestic personal and commercial banking than its bigger rivals. CIBC’s growth has cooled since it stopped expanding its team of mobile-mortgage advisers that fuelled a surge in home-loan balances, with year-over-year growth peaking last year at around 12 per cent. Government measures to slow Canada’s heated housing market, including tougher mortgage-qualification rules imposed in January, have also affected demand.Net income for the quarter rose 25 per cent to $1.37 billion, or $3.01 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $2.60, a year earlier, CIBC said in a statement. Adjusted profit, which excludes some items, was $3.08 a share, compared with the $2.93 average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank increased its quarterly dividend 2.3 per cent to C$1.36 a share.Shares of CIBC rose 0.8 per cent to $122.74 at 10:41 a.m. in Toronto, its highest intraday price since Jan. 22 and the best performance in the S&P/TSX Canadian Banks Index. The stock has gained 0.2 per cent this year, compared with the 2.4 per cent advance of the eight-company index.On Wednesday, Royal Bank posted third-quarter profit that beat estimates on gains in wealth management, capital markets and personal-and-commercial banking. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal are scheduled to report results on Aug. 28, followed by National Bank of Canada on Aug. 29 and Toronto-Dominion Bank on Aug. 30.Here’s a summary of CIBC’s results:Revenue rose 11 per cent to $4.55 billion from a year earlier, while non-interest expenses increased 4.9 per cent to $2.57 billion.The bank set aside $241 million for soured loans, up 15 per cent from a year earlier due mainly to higher losses in its CIBC FirstCaribbean bank.Earnings from Canadian personal and small business banking climbed 14 per cent to $639 million.Canadian commercial banking and wealth management profit rose 20 per cent to $350 million.U.S. commercial banking and wealth, including contributions from its PrivateBank takeover, were $162 million, compared with $41 million a year ago.Capital markets earnings increased 5.2 per cent to $265 million.Bloomberg.com"

The result is that thousands of names, complete addresses and details on the value and price of each investment is posted on what’s known as a Form 9. There were 5,845 such forms publicly available on the CSE’s website on Aug. 3.The CSE disclosures raise personal privacy concerns, said Frank Allen, executive director of FAIR Canada, an investor rights group.“The extent of personal investor information required by the CSE’s Form 9 is disturbing and in our view goes beyond the level of information necessary for the CSE to discharge its private placement regulatory mandate,” Allen said in an email, noting that the parallel disclosure form required under Canadian securities laws keeps investors’ personal information confidential.In one recent example, a June 22 private placement by Chemistree Technology Inc., more than 130 names, addresses and amounts invested were published on the site. The investments in the Vancouver-based pot company ranged from 10,000 to 425,000 shares, at 35 cents each. Under a private placement, shares are sold directly to investors rather than through a public offering.The policy has been an annoyance for some. Tarik Elsaghir, president of Cedar Point Capital Inc., a family office in Calgary, said he’s received unsolicited pitches on other stocks from people who got his firm’s information off the CSE’s website. A Form 9 filed on June 15 shows Cedar Point bought 500,000 shares of Tidal Royalty Corp. at 33 cents a share. Tidal and Chemistree didn’t return calls seeking comment.“People start cold-calling you and soliciting you on other products and other deals and you can tell they got it” from the CSE, he said in a phone interview. “What is the purpose of this and why do they have to publish everything? It might be too much information.”Individual buyers in these private placements tend to be wealthy, getting “accredited” investor exemptions, meaning they have personal financial assets of more than $1 million or income of at least $200,000.Even celebrities sometimes show up in the filings. Los Angeles Kings defenceman Dion Phaneuf of the National Hockey League, who has also played for Toronto, Ottawa and Calgary, bought 500,000 shares of Tidal Royalty for an investment of $165,000, according to a CSE filing. Tidal provides commercial financing services to cannabis companies. Phaneuf didn’t respond to a request for comment through his agent.The Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange, both owned by TMX Group Ltd., don’t publish the personal data of investors. In separate rules for private placements, Canadian securities regulators stipulate that they will collect but won’t publish investors’ names and addresses.“FAIR Canada believes it would be timely for the CSE to update and harmonize its Form 9 information requirements with these statutory disclosure requirements for private placements,” Allen said.Richard Carleton, chief executive officer of CSE’s parent company CNSX Markets Inc., said the policy was put in place to ensure more transparency around participants in private placements.Carleton said the Toronto-based CSE is looking to revise the rule after receiving feedback from issuer companies, exempt market dealers and investors supporting a change in the policy. The exchange plans to publish for public comment amendments that would remove the requirement for companies to disclose the names, addresses and number of shares acquired by arm’s-length investors, he said.The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada declined to comment on the CSE specifically but noted that Canadian law generally requires organizations “to obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.”Former Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian said organizations that collect personal data need to be aware of the repercussions of publishing it, adding that including financial details “heightens the risk dramatically.”“It’s always the unintended consequences of publicizing this information,” she said. “You simply don’t know how it can be used or used against you.”Bloomberg.com"
45,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Kevin Orland,Crude's bull run made this oilsands producer Canada's top stock,MEG Energy has more than doubled in value so far this year,,,,,2018-07-12,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/crudes-bull-run-made-this-oilsands-producer-canadas-top-stock,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meg_energy.jpg,"For any investor who was looking to gain from rising oil prices, there may not have been a better way to play the recent bull run than MEG Energy Corp.So far this year, the Canadian oilsands producer has more than doubled in value. Its shares in Toronto are leading the 246-company S&P/TSX Composite Index and blowing away peers in the S&P/TSX energy index, which is up just 3.7 per cent. Calgary-based MEG is even beating the best-performing U.S. rivals on the S&P 500 energy index.“This is, perhaps more than any other energy equity in North America, the most levered name to oil you can think of,” said Chris Cox, an analyst at Raymond James. “It’s probably the preferred name for anyone who’s getting bullish on oil and trying to get exposure.”MEG’s surge has been driven by its status as a pure-play heavy-oil producer, churning out about 93,000 barrels a day from Alberta’s Athabasca oilsands, at a time when falling production from Venezuela and Mexico has left U.S. Gulf Coast refiners hunting for more heavy crude. The situation has pushed up the price of Western Canada Select almost 50 per cent this year, about triple the 16 per cent gain for more expensive West Texas Intermediate light oil.By contrast, Canada’s other major oilsands players all produce some natural gas or have refining operations that dilute their benefit from rising heavy-oil prices. MEG also is carrying a higher-than-average debt load, making it more vulnerable to crude prices when they drop but more dramatically improving its prospects in a rally like this year’s.While MEG’s hefty borrowing was exactly what had led many investors to shy away from the stock, the company addressed concerns over its indebtedness earlier this year by selling its stakes in the Access Pipeline and the Stonefell Terminal oil-storage facility for $1.61 billion (US$1.2 billion). The shares jumped 13 per cent the day that deal was announced.Though the company still has debt of more than four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — more than peers like Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. — Cox said the asset sales made MEG much more “palatable” for investors.“That gave the market the comfort to take the risk on the story on the basis that oil goes higher, without the balance sheet being so challenging that you couldn’t get around it,” he said.MEG will start generating free cash flow next year and should work its debt down to about two times Ebitda, in line with peers, by 2020, said John Rogers, MEG’s head of investor relations. The company also is ramping up production to 113,000 barrels a day by 2020, which will increase its ability to generate cash, he said.“We’ll basically be growing into our debt,” Rogers said.However, there are risks ahead. Company founder Bill McCaffrey retired as chief executive officer in May, and MEG is searching for a successor who will continue to execute on the company’s strategy. The transportation system in western Canada remains fragile, even though MEG currently has capacity to move a third of its output to refiners on the Gulf Coast.As for oil, OPEC and its allies recently pledged to increase production by 1 million barrels a day, while a trade war between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest consumers of crude, dims the outlook for growing demand. Prices for the WTI benchmark in the U.S. plunged 5 per cent on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s government announced tariffs on another US$200 billion of Chinese-made products. MEG fell 4.6 per cent.Plus, the producer’s rally this year to $10.78 Wednesday still leaves it more than 80 per cent off its high of almost $53 seven years ago, and the company remains a money loser for China’s CNOOC Ltd., its biggest shareholder.That’s not to mention that the run-up in MEG’s shares has stretched its valuation. The stock is trading at an enterprise value of about eight times next year’s estimated Ebitda. That’s higher than the ratio of 6.8 times at Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources. Cox downgraded MEG’s shares to the equivalent of a hold last week, based solely on its valuation.For his part, MEG’s Rogers says the company’s value hasn’t been fully realized. MEG is boosting its production amid rising oil prices with an improved balance sheet and free cash flow on the horizon, he said.“We’re still kind of in the early innings of this game, in terms of this entire recovery,” Rogers said in an interview. “We don’t think we’re fully valued today at all.”Bloomberg.com"

The private-jet market is rebounding just in time for the debut of the company’s swanky Global 7000. And a partnership with Airbus SE is paying dividends in the form of stepped-up sales of a small jetliner Bombardier developed — as evidenced by JetBlue Airways Corp.’s US$5.4 billion order Tuesday.The improving results highlight the company’s progress under Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare, who has been working to ease the strain from two aircraft-development programs that left Bombardier saddled with about US$9 billion in debt. His turnaround effort still has miles to go, but his moves to shore up liquidity, cut jobs and ally with Airbus have increasingly won over investors.“They’ve de-risked the company, and people are starting to realize that,” Cam Doerksen, a National Bank Financial analyst, said Wednesday in a phone interview. “There have been a number of positive events in the last few months, including a better environment for business jets. The prospects for positive free cash flow are becoming more apparent.”Bombardier rose 1.5 per cent to $5.49 at 10:56 a.m. in Toronto, having earlier touched its highest intraday level since August 2011. The shares have advanced about 80 per cent so far this year — the third-biggest gain on Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index. They also boast the best return among 48 global aerospace companies with a market value of at least US$500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Doerksen has an outperform rating on Bombardier stock, which he predicts could reach $6 within 12 months.Bombardier expects to break even on a cash flow basis, plus or minus US$150 million, for all of 2018. The company reaffirmed the forecast when it released its first-quarter results on May 3 and announced the sale of its Downsview property near Toronto for US$635 million cash.Rising demand for business jets and trains, Bombardier’s two biggest lines of business, are two factors stoking investor enthusiasm.Private plane orders climbed in the first quarter from the previous three-month period, ending a slump of almost two years. Inventories of used business aircraft, meanwhile, are near their lowest in more than a decade.Bombardier is working toward the service debut of its most advanced ultra-long-range business jet, the renamed Global 7500, in this year’s second half. Montreal-based Bombardier is banking on the plane, which will sell for about US$73 million, to contribute about US$3 billion in annual revenue at the start of the next decade.“The business jet market is continuing to increase, and the Global 7500 looks like it’s going to enter service on time,” AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said. “Meanwhile, their train business is moving to an inflection point, and you should see acceleration of cash flows in the back half of the year. You put all of this together and you see some rationale for the story to improve.”Murray raised his rating on Bombardier to outperform from sector perform last week, boosting his 12-month target price to $6.50 — a 44 per cent increase.On the commercial aircraft front, Bombardier’s partnership with Airbus on the plane formerly known as the CSeries is already starting to pay dividends.On Tuesday, JetBlue unveiled firm plans to order at least 60 of Airbus’s A220 jets — the new name for the former CSeries aircraft. The sale is the first since Airbus took control of the program last week from Bombardier.“The CSeries is now in stronger hands with Airbus, and we just got an illustration of that yesterday,” Murray said. “Airbus’s involvement will likely drive additional orders. Maybe it’s better for Bombardier to own a smaller piece of a more successful program.”Bloomberg.com"

MEG Energy Corp. was the top-performing S&P/TSX stock in the second quarter, rising 141 per cent.Ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations coupled with U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, retaliatory measures from Canada, and the more dire threat of U.S. duties on autos are making investors nervous, but trade fears will ultimately be overlooked by strong fundamentals, Bangsund said. She sees the most upside in value stocks including energy, financials and materials — the three largest sectors on the S&P/TSX, which together account for about two-thirds of the benchmark.Tightening global crude supply, improving fundamentals and the persistent underperformance of the sector means the rally in Canadian energy stocks “is likely to be more extended than our previous assumptions,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note last week, raising his rating on the sector to overweight from market weight. He has a year-end target of 17,600 for the S&P/TSX.The most bullish outlook is from Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities. He sees the benchmark outperforming the U.S. market and ending the year at 18,000, driven by commodity demand.“I still think the U.S., given its high multiples and exposure to international markets, will have a hard time progressing and the Canadian market will offer a better return,” he said.Sadiq Adatia, who manages about $21 billion as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, is the most bearish among the analysts surveyed, seeing the S&P/TSX ending the year between 16,000 and 16,250. That’s above his earlier forecast of 15,200 but implies stocks will slip from current levels.“We still have these NAFTA concerns, oil has probably plateaued, and the Bank of Canada will probably raise rates one more time so you won’t see consumers being too aggressive in their spending either,” Adatia said. “We don’t see significant upside from here.”Here are the strategists’ calls for year end, ranked from bulls to bears:Laurentian Bank: 18,000BMO Capital Markets: 17,600Scotia Capital: 17,400Fiera Capital: 17,300Edward Jones: 17,050Manulife: 17,000Canaccord Genuity: 17,000Russell Investments: 16,900RBC Capital Markets: 16,300Sun Life: 16,000-16,250Bloomberg.com"

Toronto-Dominion’s returns more than doubled its Canadian competitor in the past year, eliminating the premium Royal Bank shares enjoyed for the better part of a decade.“The pendulum has swung a bit more negative on Royal Bank,” John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Plc, said in an interview. “There’s no one definitive thing that says Royal’s outlook is now being tarnished relative to TD’s. It just looks like we’re getting a shifting preference in the marketplace.”Royal Bank’s stock valuation, measured by share price to tangible book value, has tended to carry a premium over other Canadian banks for the past decade. Toronto-Dominion did hold a higher valuation from the early 2000s up until the financial crisis — a period when it was buying U.S. banks. Since November 2012 it’s been all RBC, until the past month.Toronto-Dominion shares have surged 18 per cent in the past 12 months while Royal Bank gained 7.1 per cent. The eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index rose 8.8 per cent in the period. Royal Bank closed at $100.44 in regular Toronto trading on Wednesday, while Toronto-Dominion hit a record $76.74.“Our strong performance is reflective of a consistent customer-focused strategy,” Toronto-Dominion spokeswoman Alison Ford said in an emailed statement. “We continue to focus on investing in our transformation to deliver for our customers.”Royal Bank declined to comment on the relative stock performance and change in premium.“It’s just investors going to TD for the bigger U.S. exposure, not necessarily something against Royal,” said Steve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7 billion including banks.Canada’s two largest lenders dominate domestic banking, but differ in their strategies abroad. Royal Bank’s U.S. strength lies with its capital-markets division based in New York and a wealth-management operation that houses City National, a private and commercial lender dubbed Hollywood’s “bank to the stars.” Toronto-Dominion bet on U.S. retail banking starting in 2005, spending $17 billion on takeovers to assemble a branch network from Maine to Florida.Royal Bank’s shares took a hit following its second-quarter earnings report on May 24, and fell for five straight days, even as profit exceeded analysts’ estimates. Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan called the earnings a “lower-quality beat.” While they have since rebounded, shares remain below the record close of $108.05 set Jan. 22.“Usually when RBC beats by a lot it’s because of the capital markets,” Belisle said. “So far this year, it hasn’t been a very strong year.”Eight analyst rate Royal Bank shares a buy, while another eight rate it a hold and two, including Aiken, say the stock is a sell. Aiken sees the stock’s valuation as too high relative to its growth prospects. Twelve analysts rate Toronto-Dominion a buy, with four calling the stock a hold and one a sell.Royal Bank’s operations leave little to complain about, according to Aiken, though investors may feel that TD is a better bet on its U.S. strategy — especially following last month’s earnings reports.“You look at the resurgence of TD and we’ve seen some strength in their U.S. operations, which will always get people excited,” Aiken said. “The market believes that TD’s growth in the U.S. should be stronger over the next little while than at Royal.”Royal Bank may be getting penalized on its domestic strengths. As Canada’s largest mortgage lender, it has a 16 per cent market share when the nation’s housing market is cooling and debt-laden consumers are starting to pare back borrowing.At a June 13 investor day, Royal Bank sought to publicize new digital products and other innovations. Chief Executive Officer David McKay lamented that the firm isn’t convincing as many Canadians as he’d like to switch banks.“We’ve built an incredible franchise over time with all this sales power, yet we’re frustrated,” McKay said. “We’re No. 1, the customer tells us we’re No. 1, experts like Retail Banker say we’re No. 1 in the world — yet we don’t think enough Canadians are using our services.”As a further indignity, TD once again stole the crown of Canada’s biggest bank by assets — a rank Royal Bank has held for most of the past century. Royal Bank is still larger by market value, though even that lead is shrinking.For Manulife’s Belisle, those are of little consequence — but he sees opportunity with the premium switch.“It makes quite a bit of sense to shift some money potentially from TD into Royal just for the valuation gap,” Belisle said.Bank executives can find it hard to turn the tide on sentiment over the near term, but those who do things right eventually get credit, Barclays’ Aiken said.“You cannot scream from the hilltops and say, ‘We are better than everybody else, why are we not trading at the best multiple?’ — that just does not happen,” Aiken said. “But if you run your businesses better than everybody else, ultimately you will be rewarded.”Bloomberg.com"

After a bout of volatility that sent global markets plunging in February, it took nearly six months for Canadian stocks to claw their way back to levels last seen at the beginning of the year. The S&P 500 Index is still trading about 3.6 per cent below its Jan. 26 high.“It’s odd, we had the Canadian economy accelerating through about mid-2017 and the TSX was fading and lagging the U.S., and now the economy’s really coming off the boil and the TSX is back at a record high,” said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.Pot stocks jumped after Canada’s upper house voted to approve the legalization of recreational marijuana, putting the country on track to see the drug sold in stores some time after September. Canopy Growth Corp. rose 3.3 per cent to $43.92 for a market value of $8.7 billion (US$6.5 billion) after touching a record earlier.Energy stocks, which account for about 19 percent of the index, have gained 11 per cent since the beginning of the second quarter, making them one of the primary drivers of recent gains. The smaller health-care and technology sectors have done even better, posting gains of 22 per cent and 18 per cent respectively quarter-to-date.The best-performing company year-to-date is Canada Goose Holdings Inc., up 128 per cent, followed by MEG Energy Corp. and Shopify Inc.Still, Canada’s year-to-date performance is tepid at best. The benchmark is up 1.3 per cent since the beginning of 2018, putting it in the middle of the pack of developed-world stock markets. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 3.7 per cent in 2018 and Norway, the top performer, has gained 9.4 per cent.Strategists expect the S&P/TSX to end the year at 17,068, a further gain of 3.9 per cent, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average year-end forecast of 2,941 for the S&P 500 in the U.S., a projected gain of 6.1 per cent from current levels.Kavcic said he doesn’t expect the momentum to continue, as he doesn’t see oil prices rising much beyond current levels and believes tighter monetary policy and slower credit growth will weigh on Canadian financials.“Fundamentally, it’s not a negative environment but it might argue for maybe a little bit more modest performance from here on out for Canada stocks,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

For investors in Canadian markets, technology, health care and real estate stocks, along with government bonds, are the places to park money until the storm passes, strategists say.Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index retreated Tuesday, joining most equity markets lower, as the U.S. and China threatened punishing tariffs on each other’s imports. The loonie also tumbled while government bonds rallied.Canada may not seem like the safest place to invest in the middle of the global trade spat, given stalled NAFTA talks and new U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. But investors shouldn’t flee the market entirely, said Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities.“Keeping some funds in the Canadian index is not such a bad idea,” Vallee said in a phone interview. “The world economy is still growing fast, demand for commodities, demand for oil — I think they will compensate over the next year for any fallout in the other sectors.”He recommends exposure to technology companies like CGI Group Inc., a fast-growing IT provider that has operations on both sides of the border and won’t be seriously affected by potential tariffs. He also likes health-care stocks, real estate investment trusts and insurance companies like Power Corp. of Canada that have growing exposure to China.These sectors don’t have much impact on the broader S&P/TSX, with technology and health care accounting for 4.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent of the benchmark’s weight respectively. But that doesn’t mean the Canadian market as a whole will underperform. In fact, Vallee sees the S&P/TSX doing better than the S&P 500 Index in 2018, forecasting a total gain of 11 per cent for the Canadian benchmark and about 5 per cent for U.S. stocks. Canada’s main equity gauge has risen less than 1 per cent this year, trailing the 3 per cent U.S. gain.“A lot of companies on the U.S. stock market are exposed to trade as well, much more than the economy itself,” he said. A stronger U.S. dollar will take a bite out of those companies’ earnings, and U.S. stocks are also trading at higher multiples than their Canadian counterparts, he added.Canadian investors “are going to have to be tolerant of a lot of uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the trade negotiations,” but the market still looks reasonably valued and earnings expectations continue to accelerate, said Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp.“We still think there’s opportunity here, particularly in those later-stage sectors of the marketplace” like resources and financials, said Bangsund, who sees the S&P/TSX hitting 17,300 by year-end as oil prices rise to US$72 a barrel. That implies a 5.8 per cent gain for Canadian stocks from current levels.Canadian companies with a high percentage of foreign revenue have outperformed domestic-focused companies this year and should continue to do so, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.“We believe the passage of U.S. tax reform and the associated surge in U.S. growth are likely the main drivers,” he wrote.S&P/TSX firms with the highest foreign revenue exposure, excluding resource companies, include Dream Global Real Estate Investment Trust, Enghouse Systems Ltd., Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Onex Corp. and Mitel Networks Corp. Other potential winners include Boyd Group Income Fund, the auto-repair operator that gets almost 90 per cent of its revenue from the U.S. market. Boyd, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, jumped to a record high Tuesday of $119.60.Canadian firms with U.S. revenue will also benefit from a weaker loonie, which has tumbled more than 5 per cent this year. The Canadian dollar slipped to a one-year low of 75.24 U.S. cents Tuesday, and is the second-worst performer among major currencies against the U.S. greenback over the past month.Even the loonie may be finding a bottom, as most of the damage from the trade war rhetoric has been done, according to Juan Perez, a Washington-based senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. He was among the top three loonie forecasters in the first quarter, according to a Bloomberg ranking. He sees the currency rebounding from about $1.33 to the dollar.“Tariffs are on and off depending on tweet storms,” Perez said. “Oil and commodities will catch a break in the second half of the year and propel the Canadian dollar to ranges of $1.295-1.305 per U.S. dollar.”As a last resort, Canadian government bonds are always a good haven. Government debt has been a beneficiary of the global flight to safety, with the yield on the country’s 10-year securities falling five basis points to 2.15 per cent Tuesday, the lowest since April 9.–With assistance from Maciej Onoszko.Bloomberg.com"

Macquarie Capital Markets offers one simple answer: the housing market itself — highlighting that the share of employment tied to construction as well as finance, insurance and real estate is nearly two standard deviations above its long-term average.Tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates have weighed on activity in formerly high-flying Canadian housing markets, with home sales in Toronto having their worst start to the year since 2009.“For downside risks to be realized, however, any potential housing-related weakness must spill over into the labour market,” analyst David Doyle wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “While rising rates put pressure on consumer finances, job losses trigger defaults and a tightening in credit conditions that can lead to more severe economic outcomes.”Roughly half of all economic weakness during recessions since the Second World War is tied to fluctuations in residential investment, he calculates, and the extent to which Canadian output and employment are currently reliant on this is “unprecedented.”Macquaire’s best-case scenario is that the fallout, starting in 2020, will be as bad for Canada as the 2008-09 financial crisis. Worst case: The unemployment rate will spike by more than any recession since the Great Depression.In terms of employment concentration in housing-linked industries, this dependency is particularly pronounced in Ontario and British Columbia but still prevalent across the rest of the country. Job growth in these sectors has come amid shrinking payrolls in other cyclical areas like manufacturing, making “housing an all the more important driver of the Canadian business cycle,” Doyle said.The strength in housing starts and consumer spending, however, suggests only a “modest” risk of a housing-led recession in the nearer term, according to the analyst.Macquarie sees the U.S. dollar rising to $1.36 relative to its Canadian counterpart by the end of 2019. Housing-related risks inform the bank’s stance to overweight outward-facing segments of the S&P/TSX Composite (like energy, technology and industrials) while underweighting areas with immense domestic ties (banks, consumer and telecom).Bloomberg.com"

Home sales fell to the lowest in more than five years in April amid tougher mortgage qualification rules.Canadian bank stocks are little changed this year according to the S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks index versus a 2.8 per cent gain for KBW Bank Index of U.S. banks.Earnings season for the banks’ fiscal second quarter kicks off Wednesday with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, followed by Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank on Thursday.

It put offers on 1,500 and ended up buying about 400. This quarter, the Canadian firm expects to buy up to 600 more.Tricon has become the third-largest publicly listed landlord of U.S. single-family rentals by snapping up homes from Arizona to Florida. It now ranks behind Invitation Homes Inc., backed by Blackstone Group LP, and American Homes 4 Rent in a market it says is valued at about US$3 trillion and is still largely owned by individual investors.The demand “feels like it’s insatiable,” Tricon Chief Executive Officer Gary Berman said in an interview in Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “Sixteen million American households rent single-family homes. So put that into perspective. That’s bigger than the entire Canadian housing market.”Tricon is aiming to double its assets under management to US$10 billion by 2023, attracting capital from institutional investors and bringing corporate efficiency to the market. The Toronto-based company owns 15,500 rental homes in the U.S., with a value of about US$2.9 billion. That compares with more than 80,000 for Invitation Homes and about 52,000 for American Homes 4 Rent.The U.S. market for rentals has boomed as banks tightened credit standards for mortgages after the housing crash, Berman said. In today’s sharing economy, there’s also less stigma associated with renting, Berman said. Then there’s technology, which has made it possible for businesses to buy homes and manage their properties at scale.“I mean, we’re buying 400 homes, and we could be buying 800 homes per quarter, one at a time,” Berman said. “You can’t do this without technology. This is a technology business.”Tricon is also building out its maintenance capabilities, with a fleet of trucks Berman calls a “Home Depot store on wheels.” That helped the company push repair and maintenance costs down to 9.7 per cent of revenues in the first quarter from 11 per cent a year earlier.Tricon targets workforce housing — for police officers, teachers and the like — that rents for an average US$1,300 per month. That compares with an average of about US$1,700 for Invitation Homes.Tricon’s stock has risen about 140 per cent to a market value of $1.35 billion (US$1.05 billion) in Toronto since the company made its first foray into the U.S. six years ago. The shares have lagged Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index over the past 12 months, with an 8.7 per cent drop amid rising interest rates. The 11 analysts who follow the company rate the stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Tricon could make more acquisitions following its US$1.4 billion purchase of Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. last year, Berman said. If the company could “combine or acquire a large portfolio that was complementary, we’d obviously want to do that,” he said.The firm is also trying to draw more institutional investment into its other businesses, which include apartment development, land acquisition and home building. It has a development pipeline of 2,500 apartment rental units in Toronto, which will cost about US$1.2 billion to construct.Still, land prices have soared in the city amid the condo boom, making it harder for apartment developers to compete. That means Tricon needs to get creative in its purchases, Berman said. For example, it looks for sites where owners are willing to forgo a larger profit upfront in exchange for a steady income stream from rentals.Tricon has been able to find land owners who can “make the numbers work for us,” Berman said. “Think about how wealthy families have gotten in the city from just owning real estate that was worth nothing and now is worth a lot.”Bloomberg.com"

Fairfax would then have the option of either increasing its offer or walking away. Under the terms of the deal, Fairfax would receive a break fee of about 3 per cent if another bidder is chosen.After the takeover, Fairfax would be able to continue operating Toys “R” Us stores in Canada under the existing name. The deal would follow a Fairfax-backed consortium’s purchase of athletic equipment maker Performance Sports Inc. last year, a process that was also overseen by a bankruptcy court.Shares of Toronto-based Fairfax rose 0.4 per cent to $674 in Toronto at 9:55 a.m. and are up 11 per cent in the past 12 months.

After dismal sales during the holiday season, it opted instead to liquidate its U.S. operations and try to sell its Canadian business. Toys “R” Us had 82 stores and 3,751 employees in Canada at the time it filed for creditor protection.The unit has generated positive free cash flow since filing in September amid higher than projected sales and lower than expected disbursements, according to the most recent court monitor report.

That’s up from an earlier forecast of 16,900 at the beginning of the year and Tuesday’s close of 15,262.“The TSX has not been this cheap versus the S&P 500 since the depths of the financial crisis,” said Candice Bangsund, vice-president and portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Montreal-based Fiera. “When you take that in the context of robust global growth, accelerating earnings expectations and firm commodity prices, this argues for a nice reversal and a period of catch-up for the TSX, particularly as some of those lingering headline risks fade.”Canada is the second worst-performing stock market in the developed world this year after Switzerland, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s down 5.8 per cent versus a decline of less than 1 per cent for the S&P 500 Index. But Bangsund sees that changing as Canadian corporate earnings grow 15 per cent this year, slightly ahead of consensus and beating expected 10 per cent growth in the U.S.“Market sentiment remains extremely fragile” as investors obsess about every development in the U.S.-China trade spat, but any progress on the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations and a strong first-quarter earnings could see markets resume their climb, Bangsund said. “The earnings season could be a huge potential catalyst to get the markets refocusing their attention on fundamentals.”Canadian stocks should benefit more than most as a rotation from growth to value boosts financials and resources, which together make up two-thirds of the benchmark, she said. Bangsund also sees oil prices hitting US$70 by year-end, up from about US$66 now.Fiera is overweight Canada and emerging markets and underweight the U.S. and Europe.

Bristol Gate’s portfolio managers then apply fundamental analysis to choose the funds’ holdings from the model’s recommendations.“The core theme behind our strategy, and this is backed up by our research and by our testing, is that if we could identify the highest dividend-growth stocks in the market in the coming 12 months, and we broadly built a portfolio around those stocks, then over time we would outperform the market with lower downside risk,” Capombassis said in an interview at the firm’s offices.The resulting Concentrated US Equity ETF and Concentrated Canadian Equity ETF, launched in February, don’t look like most other dividend funds. Bristol Gate’s U.S. ETF shares only two holdings with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Total Return Index, arguably the best-known U.S. dividend growth benchmark.“If you buy the Aristocrats product, it’s the assumption that what worked in the past will work in the future, whereas we’re looking for companies that are about to go on a sustained run of dividend growth,” said Jamie Houston, manager of sales development at Bristol Gate.The Canadian ETF only has about 16 per cent of its holdings in financials, long favoured by dividend-seeking investors, versus 35 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.“You’re not buying the index with either of these two products,” said Capombassis. He cited the example of CVS Health Corp., which was owned by a Bristol Gate fund that was driven by the same strategy as the U.S. ETF. When Bristol Gate bought CVS in 2009, most of the conventional dividend funds ignored it because its yield was too low. But Bristol Gate’s algorithm identified it as a dividend grower and, sure enough, its dividend rose by 24 per cent annually until it was sold in 2016.Bristol Gate’s U.S. ETF is overweight industrials and consumer discretionary relative to the benchmark. Its holdings include Home Depot Inc., Starbucks Corp., Honeywell International Inc. and Visa Inc. Since the strategy’s inception as an offering-memorandum fund in 2009, it has returned 322 per cent versus 259 per cent for the S&P 500 Total Return Index, according to Bristol Gate.The Canadian ETF is overweight consumer staples and discretionary, with holdings like Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., Canadian Tire Corp. and Maple Leaf Foods Inc. The Canadian strategy, which Bristol Gate been running with its own money since 2013, has returned 81 per cent versus 53 per cent for the S&P/TSX Total Return Index since inception.Bloomberg.com"

It’s broad based, with every sector on the S&P/TSX Composite Index expanding its net debt relative to sales over the past 10 years.“Companies in Canada are not dummies,” Roberge said in a phone interview. “They’ve been using this lever to finance their buybacks, dividend increases, and M&A.”On a forward price-to-earnings basis, Canada’s stock benchmark is at the cheapest relative to the S&P 500 Index since the financial crisis. But Roberge suggests looking at the ratio of enterprise value, or market capitalization plus debt, to sales. By that metric, U.S. stocks are actually slightly cheaper than their Canadian counterparts, according to Bloomberg data — a fact that may help explain why the S&P/TSX has lagged the S&P 500 for much of the past decade.“The fact that we’ve been piling on more debt on balance sheets than the U.S., you invert that line and it explains much of the underperformance of Canada versus the S&P 500,” Roberge said.It’s not just the U.S. — Canada’s EV-to-sales multiples exceed those in developed markets outside North America and emerging markets as well, Roberge said.“When you start screening, Canada looks very, very bad relative to other countries,” he said. “If rates go up they will go up everywhere globally, so you want to be in a market that will be able to sustain a backup in rates and Canada will be way more vulnerable than other countries.”Roberge also believes Canada isn’t using that debt to its full advantage.”The problem is that not only do we have more debt but we’re not even able to grow our earnings faster than the rest of world, so this leverage is not being used properly,” he said.Still, he doesn’t believe corporate Canada’s debt loads are a concern as long as interest rates remain low, and the ratio of debt to sales appears to have stabilized, which he calls a “ray of light.”But if companies don’t start deleveraging, he believes Canada’s stocks could fall to the lowest level relative to the S&P 500 since before the tech bubble popped in 2001.“There’s no doubt that if we keep on adding more debt than the U.S., it’s hard to imagine that the relative performance will turn around and stage a sustainable bounce,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Contrast that with Canada, where minimum wage hikes and carbon levies are ratcheting up business costs as a housing boom pushes consumer credit to a near-record 170 percent of disposable income.“It’s not just one thing in isolation, it’s many things,” said Toronto-based Noah Blackstein, whose $1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund has outperformed 554 global peers over the past 10 years. “I don’t see how it’s of benefit to Canada.”Canadian stocks have trailed the U.S. for at least a decade but that gap has only widened since Trump’s election. The loonie is the worst-performing major currency against the U.S. dollar this year while Canadian bonds are outperforming on expectations of slower growth. Investors expect the Bank of Canada to lag the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates as it tries to avoid pushing consumers over the edge.Consumer leverage is making Peter Kotsopoulos think twice about investing in Canadian bank debt. Kotsopoulos, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Toronto-based MFS Investment Management Canada Ltd., prefers U.S. financials such Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. that issue loonie debt, or Maple bonds.“There is a little bit of an overhang in Canada’s financial market which started to pop up a couple of years ago during the real-estate bubble,” said Kotsopoulos, whose MFS Canadian Long Term Fixed Income Fund beat its domestic peers, returning 15 per cent over three years to 2017. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will seek to weaken the currency further in order to support the country’s exports, Kotsopoulos said.Further adding to the country’s debt concerns, Canada’s most populous province, Ontario, plans to return to deficit financing after balancing its books for only the first time in a decade in 2017-18. The plan has already prompted a warning from Fitch Ratings that it could pressure the province’s ratings.Part of the under-performance of Canadian stocks can be explained by the lack of innovative companies in the country’s main S&P/TSX Composite index, which is dominated by the energy sector, commodities companies and banks, the fund managers said.“The lack of tech and health care has held back Canada,” said Conrad Dabiet, who manages the $3.4 billion Manulife Dividend Income Fund that beat its peers in the three years ending in 2017 with a cumulative 33 per cent return. “We need to make sure we can compete globally because a lot of these businesses are global in scale and if you miss out, you don’t participate in that profit gain.”While Canada has long heralded its corporate tax advantage over the U.S., that’s also disappeared. Including state taxes, the U.S. rate has tumbled to about 26 from about 39 per cent before Trump’s cuts, according to Jack Mintz, an economist at the University of Calgary and one of Canada’s top tax experts. That compares with about 27 per cent in Canada, including provincial levels.To be sure, Canada’s federal budget deficit at less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product is in much better shape than the U.S. where the tax cuts will push it toward 5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2019, according National Bank of Canada. The loss of key people including Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson who had acted as stabilizing forces in the White House have injected more volatility into markets of late.But even Trump’s tough line on trade doesn’t unduly worry Blackstein at Dynamic Funds, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia, who sees it as an opening gambit aimed at leveling the playing field for U.S. companies abroad.“This is a business-focused president; it’s a business negotiation,” said Blackstein, whose global fund has about 38 per cent of its assets in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “I know there’s a lot of hyperbole, I know there’s a lot of rhetoric, I know there’s some 3 a.m. tweets, but it’s not totally unhinged.”Bloomberg.com"

At the same time, he’s tearing up some of his malls to develop apartments, trying to capitalize on the rental boom and insulate RioCan from the rise of e-commerce. By 2020 he wants more than 90 per cent of rental revenue to come from Canada’s six major urban markets, up from about 75 per cent now.“I learned a long time ago that having the title of Canada’s biggest REIT is not something that is one of my prizes so I don’t see this as a threat at all,” Sonshine, RioCan’s founder, said in an interview at the company’s Toronto headquarters. “I’m busy trying to get smaller.”Earlier this month, Choice Properties REIT, the real estate arm of Loblaw Cos., agreed to buy Canadian REIT for about US$3.1 billion — a deal that will give it more access to industrial and office space and topple RioCan from its long-held title as Canada’s biggest REIT by market value. Retail REITs have lagged Canada’s S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index over the past two years amid a decline in mall traffic and companies are pushing into other sectors including apartments and offices.RioCan is moving quickly. It’s already closed deals or is under firm agreements for about $512 million worth of properties with $200 million more under conditional contract, While most of the deals have been off-market, the company is planning to market up to $500 million worth of properties in the next two months, said Sonshine. RioCan is planning to sell about 100 of its 289 properties altogether.“I’m pretty comfortable that we’re going to hit our numbers,” Sonshine, 71, said.A major migration to metropolitan areas is underway globally, Sonshine said. “So that’s where we’ve got to start focusing our assets because that’s where you’re going to get rent growth, more demand for space and that will be where you get population growth.”Part of the revenue used from RioCan’s sales will go toward the development of as many as 10,000 residential units in Canada’s major markets, called “RioCan Living.”“There’s less demand for retail space but there’s a lot of demand for great residential apartments,” Sonshine said. “So I said, well, let’s just rip down all, or part of, our shopping centres and replace it with medium-rise or, depending on location, even high-rise apartments and then just put new retail on the ground floors of those buildings because there still is retail demand, it’s just very different.”Sonshine points to a 36-story building across from his office window in midtown Toronto as the best example of his vision: a new rental building located near the subway, a large shopping mall, offices and restaurants. RioCan has five buildings under construction in Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto so far, and is aiming to have at least three more by the end of 2018.New RioCan rentals will include ‘tech packages’ with automated concierges, lockers and cold-storage to appeal to the new trend of online grocery shopping, while common areas could include study or co-working spaces as previous amenities such as gyms, party rooms and swimming pools fall out of favour.Rising interest rates may soon counter profits from building rental housing, developers said. REITs, seen as income-producing investments, have come under pressure in general as the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times over the past past 12 months. RioCan units have lost 12 per cent over that time.“The window as far as viability in terms of the business side of rental development is closing,” Jason Turcotte, vice president of development at Cressey Development Group, said in a phone interview, adding that at least half of the Vancouver-based company’s portfolio is rental. “Rental development is super, super sensitive to interest rates.”Sonshine agreed rising rates could be a major barrier to creating affordable rental housing in markets like Toronto or Vancouver.“I’m a prisoner of the municipalities and it can take a year to get a building permit and that’s after you spend two years getting zoning — it’s a lengthy regulatory process, it’s not an easy game,” he said. “The big advantage to us is owning the land already and having some income coming in from it.”Bloomberg.com"

A booming tech and financial sector helped send unemployment in the city to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as it remained a magnet for immigrants. Meanwhile, companies such as LaSalle Investment Management Inc. have launched funds focusing on Canadian commercial property as foreign investors seek a haven with open borders and stable finances.Among high-profile transactions was Alberta Investment Management Corp.’s purchase along with KingSett Capital Inc. of the remaining 50 per cent stake in Scotia Plaza for $682 million. Also Leadon Investment Inc. bought the 567-room Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto for $216 million as part of their larger $1.1 billion portfolio acquisition of properties across Canada from British Columbia Investment Management Corp.Land sales took up the bulk of the annual increase in investment volumes rising 49 per cent to $8.5 billion, Altus said. Residential-land sales should remain strong this year, although high prices and policy changes have introduced more uncertainty to the market, Altus said. Vacancy rates in office and industrial markets should remain low due to tight supply, the group said.Organizations like WeWork Cos., the co-working giant which opened a 35,000-square-foot office with 700 members in Toronto this week, have completely changed the way that space gets contracted, Courteau said. Companies that may have specialized in shopping-mall development are now considering multi-use space that includes apartments, offices and rentals, he said.“The real estate landscape has changed to one where inventory management, understanding demographics, thinking about the use of property and about different rental scenarios is now a much more sophisticated game,” he said.That’s a bonus for Altus, which provides global data on commercial real estate and consulting options for everything from property tax to investment feasibility. “We bring a lot of expertise to those large complex type of opportunities. Every time someone wants to look at a major opportunity, we’re there first,” Courteau said.The company’s shares have jumped 70 per cent over the past three years for a market value of $1.3 billion, compared with about a 1 per cent gain for Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index.Bloomberg.com"

The tandem selling accelerated after Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan suggested officials may need to hike more than three times this year to cool the advance. The 10-year Treasury yield popped above 2.85 per cent for the first time since January 2014.“Yields have risen, inflation evidence is rising rather broadly. It’s that combo of factors that’s starting to mount,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden, said by phone. “And then you get a report, and that’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back, and that’s kind of what we got into today.”There was nowhere to hide on the stock market, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors lower. The index’s five-day rout reached 3.9 per cent — marking its first pullback of at least that much in a record 404 days. Energy shares sank 4.1 per cent as earnings disappointed and crude slumped. The tech selloff worsened, sending the Nasdaq 100 index lower by 2.1 per cent. Its weekly rout hit 3.7 per cent, most since February 2006. Not even a record rally at Amazon.com Inc. could rescue the measure, as the world’s biggest company, Apple Inc. hit its lowest since October.“People are finally starting to reprice reflation; it’s about time,” Jeanne Asseraf-Bitton, head of global cross-asset research at Lyxor Asset Management, said by phone. “Global economic growth is strong and corporate earnings are very solid, so there’s no reason to question the equity bull market. The rise in bond yields is good, it’s just the speed at which it’s happening that is making investors nervous. Bottom line: this is a healthy correction.”U.S. hiring picked up in January and wages rose at the fastest annual pace since the recession ended, as the economy’s steady move toward full employment extended into 2018. Equities are being tested by the surge in bond yields, with some fund managers saying three per cent U.S. 10-year rates would signal a bond bear market. The level is seen by many stock watchers as a potential trigger for a correction in equities.In Europe, a bond selloff deepened across the continent, and equities dropped for a fifth straight day, the longest streak since November. Disappointing results from companies including Deutsche Bank AG and BT Group Plc. paced losses, with Germany’s DAX giving up the year’s gains, capping the worst weekly decline since 2016. Bund yields reached a fresh two-year high, while the euro and British pound weakened. Japanese debt gained and the yen declined after the Bank of Japan intervened to stem the rise in rates.Canada’s main stock index also took it on the chin, sliding more than 250 points, down 4 per cent over the past week, in a broad-based decline that included drops in every sector. The S&P/TSX composite index fell 254.89 points to 15,606.03.The last such drop on the TSX was more than seven months ago when it lost about 269 points on May 17, 2017. While all sectors finished Friday in the red, shares in health care saw the steepest losses of an average 6.18 per cent.Cannabis stocks led the decline in the sector, with Canopy Growth Corp. dropping $3.44 or 12.49 per cent to $24.11, while Aphria Inc. shares fell $1.60 or 10.34 per cent to $13.88. Both were among the top three worst-performing shares on the TSX Friday."

RTOs, as they’re known, don’t require a full securities commission review or the weighty prospectuses that are the hallmark of IPOs. The easy listing rules, however, have also opened the door to stock promotion, murky disclosures and spectacular volatility.Asked if Coinsquare was considering the RTO route, which is faster and cheaper than an IPO, Diamond said, “Hell no.”“We believe that there are a tremendous amount of low-quality deals going public,” said Diamond, who was speaking at a Canaccord blockchain conference in Vancouver.Crypto exchanges have earned a bad reputation, and the best way for Coinsquare to convince investors that it’s transparent and trustworthy is to go through an IPO with its stricter disclosure requirements, he said.“We’re racing, but racing to do it right,” he said. “We’re going to take the old-school route as an IPO to the Toronto Stock Exchange.”The Toronto-based crypto exchange also plans to offer Ripple, one of 2017’s best-performing cryptocurrencies, starting in February on its platform and “will be launching one digital currency per month for the foreseeable future,” Diamond said. At present, it supports trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash and Squarecoin. Competition among crypto exchanges is surging amid a rush of investors into the market, drawn by the dizzying gains of digital currencies like Bitcoin. Yet the sector also has been marred by disruptions, delays and hacks, including Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing hundreds of thousands of its clients’ Bitcoins. Coinsquare stores 98 per cent of its assets in so-called cold storage — offline servers to prevent theft, Diamond said. Separately, the company is raising $50 million in a financing led by Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. and Cormark Securities Inc. in a deal that’s set to close on Feb. 7.

That’s less than half Chevron Corp.’s valuation.Among Canadian producers, what makes Calgary-based Husky appealing is that its significant refining capacity insulates it against the price discounts weighing on Canadian heavy crude, while its growing natural gas sales under contract make it immune to fluctuations at Alberta’s AECO hub, said Chris Cox, an analyst at Raymond James. It’s particularly attractive for fund managers who already have positions in Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.“As the market is starting to get a little more constructive on oil prices, there’s been this growing question of, ‘OK, where next after Suncor?’” Cox said. “When you consider all the various moving parts of the macro perspective — the concerns over heavy oil prices, concerns over AECO gas and this constructive outlook for refining — you could almost do a process of elimination and Husky really quickly came to the top of that list.”‘Much of Husky’s 9 per cent advance came in the final weeks of last year as oil prices surged past US$60 a barrel in New York and the company projected in early December that it would generate free cash flow of $1 billion (US$800 million) in 2018. The gains compare with a 10 per cent loss for the S&P/TSX energy index in 2017. Suncor and Canadian Natural both rose about 5 per cent. Husky rose 1.5 per cent to $18.94 at 11:59 a.m. in Toronto.Yet Husky still has a ways to go in regaining analysts’ favour. Even after four upgrades last month, only 27 per cent of the analysts covering the company recommend buying the shares. That compares with 86 per cent for Canadian Natural and 63 per cent for Suncor.Still weighing on the stock is that it isn’t as much of a pure play on the Canadian oilsands as its rivals, and some of its refining operations are less profitable than peers. Also, almost 70 per cent of the shares are owned by Li, and companies where investors are getting a minority interest tend to garner lower valuations, Cox said.Another factor that may lure portfolio managers back to Husky is the potential reinstatement of its dividend, which the company cancelled as oil prices sank in late 2015. Husky executives said last month that the board is likely to bring back a dividend this year because it has repaired its balance sheet and is generating free cash flow, and oil prices have rebounded.“They had to spend the downturn resetting some growth expectations, resetting the balance sheet, resetting the funding levels, and once they’ve gotten those ducks in a row, especially with where crack spreads are and refining margins are, now they’re at a point where they’re going to be looking pretty decent,” Cox said.Bloomberg.com"

This compares with an average year-end forecast of 2,875 for the S&P 500 Index in the U.S, a projected gain of 7.5 per cent.“A lot of people who are bullish are looking at valuations and thinking Canada’s got to play catch-up,” said Sadiq Adatia, who oversees about $20 billion (US$15.6 billion) as the chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments. “I don’t buy into that story.”Sun Life has the most bearish forecast, calling for the benchmark to end the year at 15,200, a decline of 6.2 per cent.Adatia sees four key risks facing Canadian stocks this year: high consumer debt levels, falling home prices, a potential slowdown in wage and job growth and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He believes consumer discretionary stocks are most at risk, while utilities and telecoms will be the safest investments.Unlike other forecasters, Adatia isn’t bullish on the outlook for the energy patch, which he believes won’t start to rebound until West Texas Intermediate prices rise above US$60. Adatia’s forecast calls for crude prices as low as US$50 in 2018, from about US$60 now.Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities, begs to differ. Vallee sees the Canadian benchmark hitting 18,000 by the end of the year, a target that makes him the most bullish forecaster with an implied return of 11 percent. Vallee was about 300 points off on his 2017 year-end forecast of 16,500.Vallee believes WTI prices will rise to the high US$60s in 2018, allowing Canadian energy companies to “cry for joy,” he said. On top of that, he sees an end to the glut that held down Canadian crude prices this year as pipeline building revs up.“Given the weight of the energy sector in the TSX, it’s going to explode,” he said. The energy index accounts for about 20 per cent of the benchmark.Craig Fehr, Canadian investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co., is in the middle of the pack with a forecast of 17,050. He sees energy stocks getting a lift from a rebound in the oil patch, while consumer discretionary and financials will face headwinds.“That’s based on my view that I think economic growth is going to slow quite materially in 2018,” Fehr said. He sees 1.5 per cent GDP growth this year, about half of what’s expected for 2017.Some of the forecasts for 2017 were spot on; others not so much. Among forecasts compiled by Bloomberg in March, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc.’s Martin Roberge and RBC Capital Markets’ Matt Barasch were tied for the closest estimate at 16,300, less than 100 points from the year’s closing price. The most bullish forecast was from Fiera Capital Corp.’s Candice Bangsund, who saw the TSX closing out the year at 16,575, while the most bearish was 15,150 from Manulife Asset Management’s Philip Petursson.Here are the strategists’ calls for 2018, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,200RBC Capital Markets: 16,300Russell Investments: 16,900Fiera Capital: 16,900Manulife: 17,000Edward Jones: 17,050Scotia Capital: 17,400BMO Capital Markets: 17,600Laurentian Bank: 18,000–With assistance from Julie RombomBloomberg.com"

Fidelity’s $1.86 billion Special Situations Fund returned 21 per cent in the first 11 months of the year and its $3.73 billion Canadian Growth Company Fund returned 17 per cent. That compares with a total return of 7.8 per cent for the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index over the same time frame. His new Global Innovators Class, launched on Nov. 1, raised $400 million in four weeks in Fidelity’s fastest launch north of the border.It’s all about finding industries where rapid change is occurring. This can include beaten-down sectors that are suddenly showing glimmers of hope — Schmehl owns The New York Times Co. — or stocks that are permanently disrupting their industries, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and video-game company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.“I don’t believe in Warren Buffett,” he said. “I care about new things, things that are innovative, that are growing, that are changing the world.”He’s unfazed if those stocks look expensive. “Valuation is an immaterial part of the process for me,” he said. “It’s the least useful piece of information you will ever get because everybody knows what the valuation is.”In the current long-in-the-tooth bull market, Schmehl is finding fewer of the horrible stocks and more of the expensive change-makers. He’s been adding to positions in copper and energy stocks, but otherwise is mostly focused on disruptors.Among Canadian stocks, he’s the largest investor in toymaker Spin Master Corp., and he also owns Shopify Inc., Canada Goose Holdings Inc., and “everything” in the emerging cryptocurrency space. Stocks that have sprung up in the Canadian sector include Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. and NetCents Technology Inc.Schmehl also invests more than 3 per cent of his Canadian Growth and Special Situation funds’ holdings into private Canadian companies, including DeepLearni.ng, a Toronto-based artificial intelligence company, and Thalmic Labs, a maker of wearable technology based in Waterloo, Ontario.He plans to hang onto those companies right to the end of the bull-market cycle, and maybe even beyond. “I always tell people I will ride this thing right over the top. I will own the best stocks right to the end.”This may mean losing 20 per cent when the market turns, but that kind of double-digit loss doesn’t frighten Schmehl. He’ll be ready to pounce on the next wave. “That’s when I get all the money back,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Parex is one of only four stocks in the 50-company S&P/TSX energy index that have gained since July 30, 2014, the last day oil closed above US$100 a barrel.The gain by Parex shows how investors have taken a liking to small producers who focus their operations in one region and aren’t too adventurous with their capital spending. While their diminutive size may seem like a disadvantage in a business dominated by behemoths, being small allows producers to provide investors with a clear picture of their plans and to wring out costs that larger operations can’t avoid.“They’re just more focused, more focused on costs,” said Ken Lin, an analyst at Paradigm Capital in Calgary. “In a lower price environment, the lower cost operator is the better operator.”Parex, based in Calgary, produces oil in Colombia through both new wells and by reactivating old fields using enhanced-recovery techniques. The company also held assets in Trinidad & Tobago when it was split off from Petro Andina in 2009, but sold them to focus on its more promising Colombian operations. The shares have gained 11 per cent since oil slipped below US$100. The broader energy index has slumped 33 per cent.In a lower price environment, the lower cost operator is the better operatorDriving Parex’s gain has been a debt-free balance sheet and an ability to increase its reserves and production entirely out of its cash flow, said Lin, who in a recent note nominated Parex as perhaps “the best oil and gas company in the universe.”Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said that the company will continue to focus on Colombia, rather than try to transport its expertise elsewhere.“We know how to do business here,” Taylor said in an interview from Bogota, where he spends four to six weeks a year. “We have a very strong team here, we understand the geology. Why would we change what we want to do?”A similar story comes from Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd., the third-best-performing Canadian energy producer since the oil crash. Advantage owes its success to a concentration on producing natural gas from a prime land position in Alberta’s Montney shale formation and production costs that are among the lowest in the industry, CEO Andy Mah said in an interview. Advantage had corporate cash costs of 73 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent last quarter.Mah says the company was an early adopter of a philosophy that junior and intermediate energy companies need to structure themselves to be able to generate long-term profitability and corporate returns, rather than simply develop an asset and sell themselves to a major within five years. While shares of Calgary-based Advantage are down 7.8 per cent since July 2014, that’s outperformed both the energy index and the price of natural gas, which has slid 23 per cent.“There are probably going to be less of those peaks than valleys, and you have to be able to make money in the valleys,” Mah said in an interview. “At US$100 oil, were a lot of companies doing everything they could to minimize their costs? I would say probably not.”Investors are tired of seeing oil and gas companies take cash flow that they are generating from one asset and plow it into other assets that don’t generate the same returns, said Justin Anderson, an analyst at Mawer Investment Management Ltd. Energy producers could attract investors who normally wouldn’t consider them by sticking only to a clearly defined set of assets and by paying only special dividends, instead of regular quarterly dividends, he says.“If you find some great new play, start a new company,” Anderson said. “And execute under that strategy and have investors invest under that new asset.”However, the big, diversified players haven’t fallen too far out of favour. Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil company by market value, is the second best-performing producer in the energy index since the crash. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which produced more than a million barrels of oil equivalent a day last quarter, is the fourth.For many investors, more important than size or focus is how companies allocate capital, and on that front, Suncor and Canadian Natural both took advantage of the downturn to acquire billions of dollars of assets in deals that analysts have generally viewed as bargains.“Good management teams understand when to do land capture, when to build infrastructure, and then when to push on the pedal for growth,” Paradigm’s Lin said. “Very few teams are good on that.”Bloomberg.com"

And there may be more ways to invest soon: At least two Canadian firms have filed to launch what could be among the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Canada’s stock markets are no strangers to investing fads, with cobalt, lithium and marijuana stocks all bubbling higher this year. The country’s TSX Venture Exchange has been dubbed the “wild west,” the penny stocks among its more than 1,700 listings gyrating wildly from one day to the next.Cryptocurrency experts say the fast-evolving bitcoin sector is a classic case of buyer beware, not unlike the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s when shares would spike in value simply because a company had “.com” in its name. Bitcoin, one of several digital currencies, briefly topped US$11,000 on Nov. 29 and was trading at about US$10,780 on Friday, up roughly 11-fold this year.“There is an arbitrage that comes from being a public company with ‘something blockchain’ in the name,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research LLP in London. “The demand is really high for anything crypto and the supply is very low, so you’re not really winning on your merit, you’re just winning because of the market dynamic.”The market is crying out for a “traditional vehicle at a really low price point,” like an exchange traded fund, he said. “Make the whole thing boring and vanilla and remove the mystery of it.”Toronto-based Evolve Funds Group Inc. and Purpose Investments Inc. hope to do just that. They’ve recently filed regulatory documents to launch ETFs based on the bitcoin futures contracts that will begin trading Dec. 18 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. is also “interested in creating an ETF that would give investors multiple types of exposure to bitcoin,” co-chief executive officer Steve Hawkins said in an email.Raj Lala, CEO of Evolve, said the ETF will be a way for investors to bet on bitcoin “without worrying about the fact that you might be buying physical bitcoin from some unscrupulous service.” Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd.: Cryptocurrency miner backed by Canadian mining maverick Frank Giustra. The firm owns a data centre in Iceland with options to acquire more facilities in other cold countries which keep the computer cooling costs down.

The decline pared this year’s advance to 8.9 per cent. The stock was trading down 1.83 per cent at $81.95 by mid-afternoon.Lower trading revenue and investment-banking fees contributed to a 15 per cent drop in earnings for Scotiabank’s capital markets business, the only division to report a decline for the fiscal period ended Oct. 31. Trading revenue fell 42 per cent to $220 million from a year earlier, led by declines in fixed-income and commodities, while underwriting and advisory fees slipped 2.9 per cent to $165 million.“Although modest, this was Scotia’s first earnings miss in several quarters,” John Aiken, a Barclays Plc analyst, said in a note to clients. “Much of the weaker earnings against last quarter related to a drop in trading revenues and foreign-exchange translation pressure from the stronger Canadian dollar.”Net income rose 2.9 per cent to $2.07 billion, or $1.64 a share, from $2.01 billion, or $1.57 a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said Tuesday in a statement. Adjusted profit was $1.65 a share, missing by 1 cent the average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Scotiabank is the first Canadian lender to report fourth-quarter earnings and may be a harbinger for how the country’s other large banks fare on the domestic front and in capital markets.

He owns almost 9.7 million shares and options in Shopify, equal to about 11 per cent of the business.Lutke, who founded the company in 2004, regained his status as a billionaire after Shopify bounced back from a short-selling attack in October. A spokeswoman for the Ottawa-based company declined to comment on the chief executive officer’s wealth.Lutke stands out among the handful of Canadian billionaires, most of whom hail from family firms built over generations. The CEO, with vivid blue eyes, has cultivated an image as a direct, even-keeled leader who has said he still codes for fun at home. He joins other Canadian billionaires including grocery kingpin W.G. Galen Weston and heirs to the Thomson media fortune, including Sherry Brydson and David Thomson.The Shopify founder is one of the few billionaires in the country to get rich from Canadian-made tech. BlackBerry Ltd. co-founders Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis were billionaires before the smartphone maker’s value imploded. But others like Uber Technologies Inc. co-founder Garrett Camp and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Joseph Tsai made their billions outside the country. Lutke now leads a pack of entrepreneurs striving to build the next wave of Canadian tech companies.Shopify’s shares jumped 4.4 per cent to US$116.75 at 10:52 a.m. in New York on Monday for a market value of US$11.6 billion, after the company reported record Black Friday sales. They’ve gained 588 per cent since their trading debut in May 2015, compared with a 36 per cent gain for the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same time frame. The company is the second-best performing stock on Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index this year.Lutke’s stake in Shopify consists mostly of Class B multiple-voting shares that give him more than triple the voting power of common shares in company affairs, according to the Bloomberg index. And he’s probably made about US$40 million after taxes from selling more than 200,000 Shopify shares since the company went public.Shopify helps small and medium-sized companies set up online stores, and provides tools to make e-commerce as smooth as possible, including payment options, cash advances and integrating into Amazon.com Inc.’s marketplace. The company has beat revenue estimates like clockwork quarter after quarter for its first two years as a public company. It employs 2,000 people and says more than 500,000 businesses use its platform, from well-known brands such as Nestle SA to proprietors flogging ugly Christmas sweaters.Still, questions about Shopify’s rocket-like growth are starting to emerge. In October, short seller Andrew Left alleged many of the company’s users weren’t successful on the platform and that growth would eventually fall off a cliff. Investors were spooked and the stock dropped 12 per cent in a single day. When the company reported in October that growth of the total amount of goods sold through its platform was slowing, the shares fell a further 14 per cent.Lutke, ordinarily soft spoken, hasn’t hesitated to strike back. He called Left a “troll” whose claims were “preposterous” but declined to give new metrics to show how many users left the company every month. The shares have since rebounded as Shopify heads into the busy holiday season and equity analysts encourage investors to buy.Lutke is taking others along on the company’s share surge. His father-in-law, Bruce McKean, a former Canadian civil servant, is one of the largest shareholders with about a 4 per cent stake that was worth about US$388.5 million at Friday’s close, according to Bloomberg data.When Lutke was building Shopify and expecting his first child with his wife Fiona McKean, Bruce offered them a place to stay to save money, according to a Globe and Mail profile. McKean wrote cheques for Shopify to meet its payroll when cash flow was tight, the story said.McKean, who keeps a relatively low profile save for a LinkedIn picture that shows him surrounded by his grandchildren, served as an early chairman of Shopify from 2007 to 2010. He worked for the Canadian government overseas including in India, Thailand and Egypt. He’s volunteered at mental health associations and Cuso International, a development organization that aims to reduce poverty globally. McKean declined to comment for this story.Lutke is also involved with a few non-profit ventures, including some related to coding such as Canada Learning Code, an organization that helps women and other groups who are under-represented in tech learn digital skills. In a Globe and Mail opinion piece last summer he argued that it’s “about damn time” kids learned how to code.That maxim has certainly paid off for him. Bloomberg.com"

The price tag, at 46 times WHY’s market value, sparked a stock market frenzy — and drew the attention of regulators.Few had heard of the Record Ridge deposit in a remote forest next to the Washington state border or Calgary-based West High Yield (W.H.Y.) Resources Ltd., until an Oct. 5 announcement that the rights were to be sold to an equally mysterious buyer, Gryphon Enterprises LLC.As the news spread, WHY rose as much as 955 per cent in one day, an extraordinary surge even on the TSX Venture Exchange, sometimes referred to as the “wild west” of unproven penny stocks. The Alberta Securities Commission launched an inquiry into the stock move, citing “the magnitude of this transaction.” Trading in the shares, which rose to $2 for a market value of $114.5 million, have been halted since Oct. 6. The commission had no further comment.If a motherlode of metal is to be extracted from an open-pit mine in those hills, it comes as a surprise to the 3,500 residents of the closest town, Rossland, B.C. While plucky prospectors are no strangers to the region — murmurs persist of undiscovered riches near the 19th-century gold-rush town better known today as a ski mecca — the price tag dwarfs any other investment in recent memory.“They came and met with a few of us at the city a couple of years ago and laid out their plans at the time — it was all very speculative,” says Kathy Moore, Rossland’s mayor. “I don’t know anymore than that.”The deal ranks No. 4 by transaction value among the year’s biggest mining-asset sales globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, vying with those like Barrick Gold Corp.’s US$960 million sale of half an Argentine mine, that churned out 544,000 ounces of gold last year. In contrast, WHY’s project has yet to apply for development permits and may be years away from breaking ground, according to its filings and a technical report describing the environmental assessment process the project faces.3,000 YearsAccording to the sale and purchase agreement, Gryphon is supposed to pay a US$500,000 deposit by Nov. 4. It also commits WHY to deliver share certificates representing 100 per cent of its issued and outstanding shares to Gryphon — a feat difficult to accomplish given that 2.36 million shares traded hands in the market on Oct. 5 and would also make the deal an acquisition, not an asset sale as described.The Canada unit of U.K.-registered SRK Consulting (Global) Ltd. audited WHY’s exploration work in a 2013 technical study of the project, backing the theory that a deposit rich in magnesium lay underground. It confirmed in an email that it has been working with WHY since the spring of 2016 to collect data and complete the studies necessary to support the submission of an environmental assessment application.In an Oct. 5 phone interview, WHY Chief Executive Officer Frank Marasco said he got the price he deserved for assets that hold about 3,000 years of supply of magnesium. His family company, Big Mountain Development Corp. Ltd., and its unit control about 43 per cent of WHY’s shares, the bulk of which were acquired for only $10 in 2006, according to WHY’s initial public offering prospectus that year. News of the Gryphon sale drove their worth up to about $40 million. Marasco declined a request to visit the site or to be interviewed again, saying all project details were available in public documents.According to the purchase and sale agreement, Gryphon is based in Swanton, Maryland. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Cummins uses an AOL email address and had a previous run-in with the Colorado state regulator over allegations of selling securities without a licence. The legal firm listed as representing Gryphon, Baker McKenzie, says it has no such client. Cummins, who in an Oct. 5 LinkedIn message said the sale is “absolutely a legitimate transaction,” didn’t respond to subsequent queries sent by email and LinkedIn.Marasco built a career buying and selling motels, strip malls and nightclubs before he turned to mining, according to a company biography. As early as 2001, he was prospecting for gold near Rossland when he stumbled upon magnesium, subsequently spending at least $12 million and drilling 77 holes over the next decade. By 2012, Marasco was telling a local newspaper, “The raw material is here. All we have to do now is mine and process it.”It may not be quite so straightforward.Magnesium is so abundant that the U.S. Geological Survey describes potential recoverable resources as “virtually unlimited.” For decades, Dow Chemical Co. extracted magnesium from seawater. The metal occurs naturally in the salt of the Dead Sea. Hundreds of millions of tons lurk in massive heaps of waste left behind by decades of asbestos mining in Quebec.“There has to be something pretty special about a magnesium deposit to differentiate it from other deposits,” says Alan Clark, managing director of CM Group, an Adelaide-based commodity researcher. That’s because assessing a magnesium resource is very different from dealing with aluminum or copper or zinc. “It’s much more about what technology solution you have to treat the resource that you’ve got, rather than how much raw material there is in any particular deposit.”Previous FlopsWHY announced test results in July that it said points to a simpler, cheaper way to process magnesium, using nitric acid, developed by Drinkard Metalox Inc. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Drinkard confirmed it has been working with WHY.Never mind that such technological hurdles have doomed earlier efforts backed by deep-pocketed investors and government cash. In the early 2000s, Noranda Inc. in Quebec and Australian Magnesium Corp. were forced to shutter smelter projects, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars invested — spectacular busts that continue to cast a pall over the sector. “I can still walk into some investment banks here in Australia today, just utter the word ‘magnesium,’ and I’ll be frog-marched out of the building,” says Clark.Still, a long-awaited surge in magnesium demand from the automotive sector — as a way to make cars lighter — may be starting to kick in. Toyota Motor Corp. also believes magnesium-based batteries could displace lithium-ion ones in everything from cars to cell phones.The bigger challenge is where’s the money to develop a mine?Any new project is likely to cost around US$1 billion to target a roughly US$2.5 billion niche market — not much of an incentive, says Todd Olson, president of the International Magnesium Association. “It’s pretty hard to get them funded because of the scale of them,” he says. “I’d expect to see some within the next decade but supported by someone with pretty deep pockets — like a Dow Chemical.”Bloomberg News"

Whether it’s NAFTA, real estate, consumer debt — all those things are negatives to Canada’s economy.”After wallowing in the red for a good chunk of the year, the S&P/TSX has gained 6.5 per cent since its September low. That strength is the result of improving oil prices, rising interest rates which have fattened banks’ lending margins and, perhaps most important, a market that had simply become too cheap to ignore.The S&P/TSX’s gains since Sept. 8 surpass a 4.9 per cent increase in the S&P 500 Index and a 3.6 per cent gain in the MSCI World Index. This is a reversal from the first eight months of the year, when the Canadian benchmark fell 0.5 per cent compared with a 10 per cent gain for the S&P 500 and a 12 per cent increase for the MSCI World Index.Even with its recent gains, the Canadian index is way behind its U.S. counterparts, which have hit a series of record highs this year. The year-to-date gain for the S&P/TSX is just 4.4 per cent versus 15 per cent for the S&P 500. Canada still lags most developed markets, ahead of only Israel and Australia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canada’s stock underperformance came, ironically, as its economy outpaced its Group of Seven peers with 4.5 per cent growth in the second quarter.“This Eeyore complex has been the defining theme for Canadian equities throughout 2017 and has resulted in Canada being one of the worst-performing equity markets year to date,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a recent note, referring to the morose Winnie the Pooh character who sees doom and gloom at every turn. Belski, who predicted the rebound in a Sept. 14 note that argued a “BIG bounce is coming once calmer heads prevail,” is optimistic that the rally has legs, pointing to stronger-than-expected earnings growth and improving fundamentals. Belski’s year-end target for the S&P/TSX is 16,000, a gain of just 0.3 per cent from here, although he says that may be conservative.“I think people are genuinely negative Canadian stocks and it’s a classic game of catch up,” he said in an interview, adding that investors need to ditch their obsession with commodities. “All they really care about is gold and oil, gold and oil, and if those two things are going up we feel better. We’ve got great companies in Canada but we consider ourselves a failure unless gold and oil are going up.”Belski recommends an overweight position in Canadian financials, industrials and materials. He likes the big banks, insurers, railways and individual stocks including West Fraser Timber Co., Waste Connections Inc., Canadian Tire Corp., Dollarama Inc. and Loblaw Cos.Belski’s view is supported by technical analysis. The $1.7 billion Horizon S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF recently formed a golden cross, meaning the short-term moving average has broken above the long-term moving average — a buy signal. Others are more reticent. Javed Mirza, technical analyst at Canaccord Genuity Corp., said the S&P/TSX seems overbought and predicted a near-term pause or pullback. The index “may hit an air pocket sooner rather than later” if investors don’t embrace commodity stocks, because financials can’t carry the rally forever, added Martin Roberge, portfolio strategist at Canaccord.TD Asset Management, meanwhile, is underweight Canadian equities on the expectation that the economy will underperform the U.S. due to high household debt, modest oil prices and low productivity.“All that says to me that the Canadian economy should slow a little bit, while the U.S. economy looks like it’s in pretty good shape,” Bruce Cooper, who manages $344 billion as chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, said in an interview this week. “We’ve had a preference for global equities over Canadian this year, and that continues to be the case.”Sun Life’s Adatia is also worried about tapped-out consumers, a deflating housing market and the risk that NAFTA renegotiations could fall apart. He said a stock pullback is “not a question of if, it’s a question of when.”“We have a lot of defensive positioning in Canada for that pullback,” he said. “I do not think there’s much more upside from here.”"

The Toronto-based retailer priced its shares at $12 apiece last week, lower than the targeted range of between $14 and $16 a share.The drop puts it on track for the second-worst first day performance of 10 IPOs above $100 million in 2017, after pot producer MedReleaf Corp.’s 21 per cent drop. It also stands in contrast to a parka-maker Canada Goose Holdings Inc., which surged 40 per cent on its debut in March.“Retail IPOs have been a little hit and miss,” Bruce Winder, co-founder and partner at Toronto-based Retail Advisors Network, said in a phone interview. “Retail is a tough game right now, especially if you’re focused on bricks and mortar.”Winder added that Roots’ brand is “a little dusty” and lacks the cache of Canada Goose. Global stock markets also dropped on Wednesday with the S&P/TSX Composite Index down 0.5 per cent to 15,820.56.“The upside is that Roots owns their own brand,” he said. That gives them more control over pricing and marketing. “Retailers that own their own brand have a fighting chance in the future.”The IPO, which raised $200 million, comes two years after the company agreed to sell a majority stake to New York-based private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners.Founders SharesFounded in 1973 by Michael Budman and Don Green, Roots has more than 200 retail stores in Canada, the U.S., China and Taiwan, selling products that seek to capture the essence of the Canadian outdoors.The 16.7 million shares offered in the IPO were sold by Searchlight and the founding shareholders, according to a company filing. The company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale, it states.The IPO was led by Toronto-Dominion Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of Montreal. The banks have the option of purchasing additional shares that could bring the proceeds of the offering up to $230 million if exercised.Following the IPO, Searchlight will control 48 per cent of the company while the founders will own about 12 per cent, according to the filing.

The measures, known as B-20 guidelines, require lenders to test a borrower’s ability to pay at the greater of the Bank of Canada’s five-year benchmark rate or 2 percentage points higher than the offered mortgage rate starting in January.“This is likely to lead to a significant number of non-prime borrowers to either defer purchasing a home or seek out a mortgage from lenders such as credit unions/caisse populaires” and, failing that, a mortgage investment corporation or private lender, the RBC analysts wrote.Alternative lenders fell in Toronto trading, with Equitable falling 1.6 per cent and Home Capital declining 2.3 per cent at 12:58 p.m. trading. Canada’s eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index rose 0.3 per cent.The alternative lenders may see the negative impacts of the rules — and potential loss of business — offset if prime borrowers get turned down by banks and end up becoming their customers, RBC said.The final rules were little changed from those the banking regulator proposed in July. One change was adding the Bank of Canada benchmark rate to the stress test criteria.“The revision to the stress test requirement is intended to dampen incentives to take variable or shorter-term fixed rate mortgages,” RBC said in its note.Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken doesn’t expect a significant impact on banks’ lending volumes.“What is out for debate is the impact it’s going to have on the monolines or some of the other providers,”Aiken said in an interview. “This could have an impact on overall lending volumes and then potentially have an impact on the housing market in totality.”Broadening the stress test will likely further slow housing activity, depressing demand by 5 per cent to 10 per cent once implemented, Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank wrote in a note. Price growth will also suffer, with the changes expected to exert a drag of between 2 per cent and 4 per cent over 2018.“On balance, these changes should help enhance the resilience of the Canadian banking system in a rising interest rate environment,” DePratto said.Insured mortgages, which were already subject to the stress test, were down 4.5 per cent on the year, according to OFSI data, while uninsured mortgage credit grew 17 per cent. While this is partly related to the rising prices of Canadian real estate, with more and more of it priced above the insurance caps, it also likely reflects the skew stemming from the past stress test requirements, DePratto said.Bloomberg.com"

Over five years, the fund’s 93 per cent return is almost double the index.“We learned a lot about the sandwich business from that investment,” said Chris Hensen, senior portfolio manager for equities at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto. In order to know their companies inside out, the four-person team focuses on revenue drivers, margins, capital allocation and cash flow. They’ve met with as many as six management teams on a single day in order to unearth opportunities in unsung corners of the market.The fund, which is invested 65 per cent in Canadian equities, 15 per cent in U.S. stocks and 20 per cent in cash, was the top performing of 48 funds with assets of more than $1 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The fund’s research on Premium Brands set it up to pounce when another sandwich company with the odd name of AdvancePierre Foods Holdings Inc. filed to go public in mid-2016.“We had brokers who were like, ‘How in the hell are you guys on this thing?’ ” Hensen said. “Well, if you did your work on Premium Brands you’d understand the sandwich business, too.”In less than a year, AdvancePierre was acquired for US$40.25 a share by Tyson Foods Inc., nearly double its US$21 IPO price. Meanwhile, Premium Brands has advanced 344 per cent, including dividends, in the three years the fund’s owned it.“We’re looking for opportunities to gain some kind of insight that the market is either missing or not fully appreciating,” said Conrad Dabiet, senior portfolio manager for equities at Manulife Asset Management. “It’s not as easy as going on the Bloomberg terminal and looking at the P/E and saying the stock is expensive or cheap.”The fund’s top holding, Waste Connections Inc., illustrates how this strategy can pay off. The fund had held both Waste Connections and competitor Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. for several years and knew that Waste Connections had a strong track record of acquisitions, while Progressive Waste had good assets but a weak management team.When Waste Connections bought Progressive Waste in 2016, the fund had insight into both companies, Dabiet said. “That day we were out buying more stock because of that confidence. Those opportunities are rare and they don’t last very long, but that’s why we need to be there to execute them.”The fund aims to have no more than 10 per cent exposure to any given business risk — for example, oil and gas producers or Canadian banks — and credits this for forcing it to look in the “nooks and crannies” of the market to find under-appreciated stocks.“We’re never satisfied,” Dabiet said. “It takes us years to truly understand a business, but once we get to that level it really is powerful because everybody’s on the same page and we can execute very quickly.”"

While the Montreal-based company added 17 net new locations, part of the boost came from a 6.1 per cent increase in comparable-store sales.Dollarama is growing faster than U.S. dollar-store chains, helped by a Canadian market that’s less saturated than its southern neighbour and an longstanding policy to stay away from fresh food. The success of new items priced $3.50 to $4, efforts to boost productivity and a penny-pinching approach to business emboldened the company to ramp up its expansion plans earlier this year.Dollarama was the top gainer on the S&P/TSX Composite Index, rising 5.2 per cent to $128.13 at 9:59 a.m. in Toronto, its biggest gain in more than five months.

Surprise, property in Vancouver still your best bet","In Vancouver, one of a clutch of global cities where appreciation seems unstoppable, sitting on a house can be more lucrative than working a job",,,,,2017-09-01,https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/why-bother-with-stocks-in-vancouvers-relentless-housing-market,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/vancouver.jpg,"In the spring of 2012, Dustan Woodhouse, then a 40-year-old Vancouver mortgage broker, broke the cardinal rule of saving for retirement: he liquidated his retirement fund, took the tax hit and plowed the rest into the local real estate market.“People told me I was crazy,” says Woodhouse, 45, whose plan is to buy and have paid off 10 such investments by his late sixties. “But that’s our pension — that’s what that property is.”Maybe not as crazy as it sounds. Vancouver is among a clutch of cosmopolitan, attractive cities around the globe where the appreciation in home prices is seemingly unstoppable. New-home prices have gained 5 per cent since March, the biggest three-month increase since 1990, data released earlier this month show. Prices in Hong Kong and Sydney also continue to soar.Woodhouse’s decision to flout traditional investment strategies has so far proved to be a winner. With the roughly $60,000 he had in hand, he took out a mortgage and bought a wood-shingled townhouse near a coastal inlet east of Vancouver for $240,000. Five years later, he figures his house has risen about 60 per cent in value if sales of nearby properties are anything to go by. In the meantime, he’s accrued a nest egg of roughly $24,000 from rental income, even after accounting for expenses, mortgage payments and taxes.Vancouver, consistently voted one of the world’s most livable cities, shows just how difficult it is for policymakers to control runaway prices. Despite a succession of government tightening measures, including a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers, the price of the typical detached house surged to a record $1.6 million in July.“It’s obviously very frustrating for local residents, but I don’t see that buying interest going away anytime soon,” Frank Giustra, a mining and film magnate based in the city, said in an interview. “All this free money has driven assets through the roof in Beverly Hills, London, Paris, all these desirable places.”In the city of Vancouver proper, which includes the downtown and some of the poshest neighborhoods, sitting on a house can be more lucrative than working a job. A single-family property appreciated almost $600,000 on average in the area in 2016, according to Jens von Bergmann, a mathematician and founder of MountainMath Software, a Vancouver-based data analysis and visualization company. As a group, the value of the properties surged by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of Vancouver’s residents, Von Bergmann calculated.Eye-popping returns — coupled with Canada’s reputation as a stable sanctuary — has made Vancouver a particular magnet for global cash. British Columbia slapped a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers a year ago after data showed more than $1 billion of overseas cash flooded into property in the region, mostly from China.The levy had an immediate impact on overseas investor participation but not on prices. Foreign buyers, who accounted for as much as 17 per cent of sales by value before the tax, plummeted to 1.8 per cent the month afterward. The cost of a typical home fell no more than 4 per cent before resuming its climb, according to figures from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.That indicates that Canadians, as much as foreign investors, are inflating the market. It’s easy to understand why. The price of a typical detached home in Vancouver rose 69 per cent in the five years through July, compared with a return of 51 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index, the country’s benchmark equity index, and 7.6 per cent for Canadian government bonds. Some 41 per cent of baby boomers said home equity made up more than 60 per cent of their household wealth, according to a survey by Manuflife Bank published in May. For 21 per cent, it made up more than 80 per cent.But as in many asset classes, timing can be everything.“Especially one that rises really quickly, there can be some really precipitous drops there too,” said Andrew Hallam, whose book on how he built a million-dollar portfolio on a teacher’s salary was a top-selling personal finance book on Amazon, said by phone from Phuket, Thailand. “If wages aren’t increasing by 15 per cent a year, then houses can’t. At some point, there’s a tipping component there.”Once they tip, they can take a long time recover: It took about a decade for U.S. home prices to return to the peak they’d reached before the housing market crash and more than 10 years for Toronto to recover levels lost in the late-1980s slump.“In this environment, every purchaser has become a speculator,” says Rhys Kesselman, an economist and public-policy expert at Simon Fraser University. He believes a capital-gains tax on home sales is the way to cool the market. Property sellers don’t pay taxes on gains made from a principal residence in Canada.“We tax our gains in the stock and bond markets, and small businesses, but we don’t tax the money we put into homes,” says Kesselman. “There’s an extra incentive to put our money into housing. Savings and capital are diverted from the productive sector of our economy.”The New Democratic Party, which took power last month, campaigned on a speculator’s tax, suggesting taxing gains on properties that are flipped could lie ahead. It’s propped up by the Green Party, which supports the introduction of a capital-gains tax. Realtors have described any such move as “political suicide” in a country where homeownership is considered a basic right, with many banking on real estate to fund their retirement.Still, it’s not clear even that would have the intended effect in a city where homes to many appear to be the closest thing to a sure bet. Woodhouse says a capital-gains tax wouldn’t faze him because he never intends to sell. He owns his primary home plus two rental properties, has paid the down payment on a fourth and is looking for a fifth to invest in. His plans to own 10 properties will be funded by working harder, belt-tightening and leveraging the equity in his existing homes.“If the values fall by half, I don’t care — it’s going to give me grocery money, clothes, a roof over my head,” says Woodhouse, who quotes the 19th-century steel tycoon, Andrew Carnegie. “The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.”Bloomberg.com"

That outpaces 26 similar mutual funds that have assets of more than C$500 million as well as the S&P/TSX Preferred Total Return Index which has gained 8 percent.The Bank of Canada will likely raise rates once more before the end of the year after tightening policy in July, while big issuers such as banks, insurance and pipelines companies look stable, the fund’s manager said.“With that kind of background, it’s hard to see anything bad happening to the asset class before the end of the year,” Roger Rouleau, who is one of the managers of the fund which has C$784 million of assets, said in an interview.Preferreds, many of whose dividends reset with higher interest rates, have outperformed Canada’s main equity gauge as well as corporate bonds amid the central bank’s hawkish turn. They’ve rebounded from a slump in early 2016 after the shares reset with lower dividends to reflect Bank of Canada rate cuts. Some issuers responded by adding a yield guarantee to protect investors from further erosion.Dynamic invests about 78 percent of its fund in rate-reset preferred shares that offer a fixed dividend for 5 years until the next reset date. The fund began allocating more of its investments into Canada during 2015 when the central bank was cutting rates and the market was cheap compared with the U.S. Now it has about 85 percent invested north of the border compared with as little as 50 percent in Canada before December 2015.It’s a bit trickier to find value now as some preferreds are no longer cheap and trading above par but a good chunk of the market still trades at a substantial discount compared with the U.S., Rouleau said. He looks for companies with strong balance sheets that aren’t necessarily “pristine” but have good management. Its top holdings include preferred shares of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, BCE Inc. and Bank of America Corp.Credit SafetyWhile rising rates may benefit rate-reset preferred shares, what really drives the asset class is credit work, Rouleau said.“The real bad scenario is when you start having defaults,” he said.He’s keeping an eye on the housing market, since many issuers are banks. Canada’s benchmark home price fell 1.5 percent in July from June, the most in nearly a decade after government moves to tame the market, including a tax on foreign buyers in Toronto as well tighter mortgage regulation.“The more we can tighten up the housing market and the mortgage market, the better it is for everybody,” Rouleau said. "
107,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Bloomberg News,Five charts that show Canadian stocks could rise from the dead,"One of the worst performing markets in the world this year, the TSX looks set for a rebound, say some prominent stock watchers",,,,,2017-08-14,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/five-charts-that-show-canadian-stocks-may-rise-from-the-dead,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/stocks1.jpg,"It hasn’t been a pretty year for Canadian stocks but signs are growing that the S&P/TSX Composite Index may be set for a rebound — if investors can move past geopolitical tensions and focus on the fundamentals.After gaining 18 per cent in 2016 and hitting a record in February, the S&P/TSX has been one of the worst-performing benchmarks in the developed world with a decline of 1.7 per cent year-to-date, second only to Israel’s 7.3 per cent drop.“You’ve seen the unwind, and clearly you can blame energy for that,” Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a phone interview.The energy index has been the worst performer on the S&P/TSX this year with a decline of 15 per cent, outpacing about 9 per cent drop in West Texas Intermediate crude prices. Energy stocks account for 20 per cent of the benchmark’s weight.However, it’s not all doom and gloom for Canadian investors. Of the 143 index members that have reported second-quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beat analyst estimates and 30 per cent have missed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter, when 49 per cent beat and 43 per cent missed, and an indication that corporate fundamentals are improving.“Investors are finally going to come to grips with Canadian growth and earnings growth is a little bit better than everybody thought so that’s where you can get more upside,” Belski said.An upbeat earnings season hasn’t had much impact on valuations yet. The gap in forward price-to-earnings between the S&P/TSX and the S&P 500 Index is the biggest it’s been since 2008. Several strategists and investors say a gap this big can’t last and will either be narrowed by declines in the U.S. or gains in Canada.“There’s a good case to be made for the bout of serious underperformance in Canada to subside,” Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.Any recovery in the S&P/TSX will need energy stocks behind it, given their importance to the benchmark. Although there are plenty of unknowns for oil prices — including OPEC’s commitment to production cuts and U.S. shale producers’ ability to fill the gap — there are also signals that investors are getting more bullish on energy.Traders invested $42 million in the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF in July, the biggest exchange traded fund tracking Canada’s energy index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That inflow was the largest since September 2016, a month when oil prices rose 7.9 per cent and energy stocks gained 3.5 per cent.Canadian oil producers are also more resilient than they were before the downturn following significant cost-cutting efforts. Meanwhile, the price discount between Western Canada Select and WTI has narrowed to about $10, the smallest in more than two years and down from a high of more than $40 a barrel in 2013 — another positive sign for the Canadian oil patch. A rebound in Canadian stocks also won’t get far without the help of financials, which account for 34 per cent of the S&P/TSX. Financials have lost 0.5 per cent this year as concern about overheated housing markets weighed on shares of the big banks.Belski said that will change as investors look for dividend growth as an alternative to bonds in a rising-rate environment. Canada’s five largest banks have averaged dividend growth of 64 per cent since 2008 compared with 32 per cent for the five top utilities stocks on the S&P/TSX over the same period.“We still believe that most investors are under-exposed financials,” he said. “Over the next three to five years in equity investing around the world, one of the biggest secular themes is going to be dividend growth and Canadian financials are among the best dividend growers in the world.”John Aiken, financials analyst at Barclays Capital, said he expects bank valuations to continue to rise in the back half of the year as stocks are buoyed by a steady domestic economy, the strongest employment landscape since the financial crisis and rising interest rates, which will boost net interest margins.“Further, we believe strengthening commodity prices, most notably WTI, could be the fuel that drives further upside to bank valuations,” Aiken wrote.Not everyone is bullish on Canadian equities. David Doyle, market strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. called Canada, its equity market and the loonie “maximum underweights” in a recent note, citing the Bank of Canada’s recent interest-rate hike.“Even a modest rate-hike cycle introduces downside risks to our base case for a prolonged period of subdued 1 per cent real GDP growth,” Doyle wrote. “A ‘made in Canada’ recession has moved from being an interesting outlier scenario to worthy of serious consideration.”And a new wrinkle has presented itself in growing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, which pushed Canadian stocks to their biggest weekly decline since June.But the economy’s growth of well over 3 per cent in the first half of 2017 — the fastest among the Group of Seven — will give equities the chance to climb out of the doldrums, Belski said. He has a 16,000 target on the S&P/TSX, which would be up 6.4 per cent from Friday’s close.“What you’re going to see is an improving Canadian economy,” he said. “I think there’s a nice opportunity for a game of catch-up in Canadian stocks, especially considering that U.S. stocks are sitting near all-time highs.”Bloomberg.com"

This results in steady cash flow and higher leverage, creating bond-like securities that are more sensitive to interest rates than their global counterparts, he said.Some of this divergent performance is playing out this year as the Fed and Bank of Canada raise borrowing costs. The biggest ETF tracking Canadian REITs, the iShares S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index ETF, is down 1 per cent. By comparison, its U.S. and global counterparts are up 1.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.“In an income environment, they outperform; when people want growth, they underperform. And in a rising rate environment, people want growth,” Russo said. “If you want to protect against interest rate rises in Canada, you should be going outside of Canada to get your REIT exposure.”Russo recommends U.S. industrial and data-center REITs, German office REITs and exposure to undervalued Hong Kong REITs.There are also opportunities in Canada if you know where to look.“If we’re going to invest in Canada, it’s got to exhibit either very attractive growth in cash flow or underlying net asset value, or it’s got to give me a good valuation,” Russo said. “It’s where do we see management teams that have the ability to add value.”For growth, Timbercreek holds office-focused Allied Properties REIT and retail-oriented First Capital Realty Inc. for their development projects, which will add to cash flow and net asset value in the coming years.For value, Timbercreek likes OneREIT, another retail name that has been upgrading its portfolio by removing weak tenants and replacing them with higher-quality names like Walmart and Dollarama. OneREIT announced Friday that it’s selling its assets to Strathallen Capital Corp. and SmartREIT at a 15 per cent premium to Thursday’s closing price.“It’s one of our largest holdings so we expect to benefit from that,” Russo said.Bloomberg News"

Higher demand for grains and metals and a rebound in potash shipments enabled Canada’s second-largest railroad to post its second consecutive quarterly sales increase.The gains will help Creel meet his oft-stated target of achieving a sales rebound in his first full year at the helm. He took over in January from Hunter Harrison, who molded the railroad into one of North America’s most efficient with an approach he called “precision railroading.” Annual revenue fell last year for the first time since 2009.“The precision railroading model is the gift that keeps on giving,” Creel said on a conference call Wednesday. “It allows us to continue to grow at low incremental cost.”Konark Gupta, a Macquarie Capital Markets analyst in Toronto, predicted “2017 is the year of volume recovery” in a note to clients published before the results were released.Canadian Pacific, with a 12,400-mile (20,000-kilometre) network stretching east from British Columbia across Canada and down to Kansas City, Missouri, carried 8.1 per cent more carloads in the period. That outstripped the 6.9 per cent increase in traffic recorded by members of the American Association of Railroads.Grain freight revenue, the company’s biggest line of business, increased 20 per cent to $363 million as energy, chemicals and plastics — a category that includes crude oil — advanced 16 per cent to $216 million. Revenue from metals, minerals and consumer products jumped 36 per cent to $190 million, while potash surged 38 per cent to $109 million.The rise in volumes helped adjusted earnings climb to $2.77 a share, Calgary-based Canadian Pacific said. That beat the $2.71 average analyst estimate.Canadian Pacific fell 1.3 per cent to close at $203.60 in Toronto. The stock has gained 6.3 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 0.3 per cent decline for Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Operating ratio, a widely watched measure of railroad productivity that compares expenses to sales, improved to 58.7 per cent from 62 per cent a year earlier. A lower number for the figure is considered better.“This quarter really does demonstrate the strength of our operating model,” Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani said on the conference call.Bloomberg "

The fund is divided about 50-50 into Canadian and U.S. equities, with the U.S. holdings providing diversification from Canada’s commodity-heavy stock market.“We’re a growth investor but we’re not hyper-growth,” said Dina DeGeer, senior vice-president and team lead of the Mackenzie Canadian Growth Team. “We don’t like deeply cyclical businesses, we don’t like commodity businesses, we don’t like capital-intensive businesses.”Instead, Mackenzie looks for stocks with a strong leadership position in their sector. “We love duopolies because they have pricing power and if you’ve created a big strong business moat you don’t have new competition coming in,” DeGeer said.One of the fund’s top holdings is Canadian National Railway Co. The Canadian rail industry is a quintessential duopoly, dominated by CN and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and CN gives Mackenzie exposure to natural resources while reducing the cyclicality that’s typical of commodities, DeGeer said.Another top investment is toy-maker Spin Master Corp., which makes up just under 5 per cent of the fund’s holdings. DeGeer described the Toronto-based company as “a real gem.” The company counts Hatchimals and PAW Patrol, two of the hottest toys going, in its stable.We're a growth investor but we're not hyper-growth“While the industry long-term grows 4 per cent organically, they have grown at least two-and-a-half to three times that,” she said, citing the innovative culture that won Toronto-based Spin Master three Toy of the Year awards in February. “I think they’re just in a class of their own.”Other top Canadian holdings at April 30 included Royal Bank of Canada, Telus Corp., CAE Inc., Metro Inc. and CCL Industries Inc., a labels and packaging manufacturer that entered the money-printing business when it acquired Innovia Group for $1.13 billion in December. Innovia makes the polymer banknotes used in Canada, the U.K., Mexico and several other countries.“It’s a very stable business with four to five per cent organic growth year in and year out, always getting operating efficiencies and very big free cash flow,” DeGeer said. “They have made a lot of acquisitions in their history and they have been excellent allocators of capital.”The Mackenzie Canadian Growth Fund’s strategy of focusing on stable businesses that generate consistent free cash flow growth works in most market environments except when the market “gets very excited and concentrated in one area,” such as the tech bubble of the late 1990s, Arpin said.That’s not the case this year. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index is flat this year, lagging most of the developed world.“In markets like we’ve seen for the last five or so years, which have been sloppy, slow, sluggish, that’s probably our best environment,” Arpin said.Bloomberg News"
113,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Bloomberg News,Will Canada's potential pot market go up in smoke?,More marijuana outfits are listing on the TSX Venture Exchange and Canada Securities Exchange as the country gears up to legalize recreational pot within the next year,,,,,2017-07-17,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/theres-a-marijuana-frenzy-that-could-end-very-badly-in-canada,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/canada_marijuanaa.jpg,"By Jen SkerrittThere’s one bummer question haunting all the marijuana businesses popping up between British Columbia and Newfoundland.How much do Canucks like weed, eh?A year before recreational cannabis is expected to become legal in Canada, there’s an explosion in companies cultivating the stuff. At least 10 marijuana outfits have new listings this year on the TSX Venture Exchange and Canada Securities Exchange. Some 51 enterprises have gotten the green light to grow pot, and 815 applicants are in the queue. All told, it could be enough to raise the country’s raw-weed output more than tenfold.This is where skeptics see froth. “If you ask people today why they don’t use it, it’s a small percentage who say ‘because it’s illegal,”‘ said Neil Boyd, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. “In many respects there might be an overestimation of demand.”Long-time users and growers insist he’s wrong, but investors aren’t so sure. Producer MedReleaf Corp. tumbled as much as 28 per cent last month in the worst debut for a Canadian IPO in 16 years amid concern pot stocks are overvalued. Shares of Canopy Growth Corp., the country’s first billion dollar marijuana start-up, are down 21 per cent in the past three months.The North American Medical Marijuana Index, which tracks leading cannabis stocks in the U.S. and Canada, has plunged 21 per cent since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in April unveiled its plan to legalize the drug by next July, 16 years after Canada permitted it for medical use.Of course, some of the decline may be attributed to the situation in the U.S. Many in the Trump administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions in particular, are no friends to the industry. For Canadian companies, the risk isn’t political.“There seems to be a little bit of investor fatigue,” said PI Financial Corp. analyst Jason Zandberg. He said they’re having trouble differentiating between the producers, new and old, and what might give them competitive advantages.That’s to be expected, according to marijuana bulls, in a brand-new market that hasn’t even arrived yet. Parliament still has to pass the recreational law (though there’s little question it’ll do so). Then the federal government will have to write rules on taxation, and each province will have to decide how to regulate distribution.“Nothing is going to be perfect right off the hop,” said Jon Bent, a licensed medical marijuana grower who has been cultivating plants on his 11-acre farm outside Winnipeg for five years. “It’s baby steps — and the industry is moving quickly.”The question is whether it’s going too quickly, considering the variety of estimates about how much recreational weed Canadians will end up regularly ingesting. Some educated guesses are that about 15 per cent of Canadians partake now, legally and otherwise. That’s around 5.4 million people, roughly the population of Colorado, which gave the nod to recreational marijuana in 2014. Medical and recreational sales there rose 56 per cent last year, to nearly $1 billion, according to Cannabase, operator of the state’s largest market.One projection, from the Canadian Parliamentary Budget Officer, is that 4.6 million people age 15 and over will use cannabis at least once and consume 655,000 kilograms next year, and that 5.2 million will be doing so by 2021. Other reports peg future recreational consumption at 420,000 kilograms a year with sales reaching $6 billion by 2021, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. said in November. For its part, the government agency Health Canada anticipates a mature medical marijuana market will be around $1.3 billion.That could underestimate the number of Canadians who will refuse to buy from corporate weed growers, said Chad Jackett, 38, who runs a medical marijuana dispensary in Squamish, British Columbia, and uses cannabis oil everyday to treat nerve pain. His concern is that new regulations will sideline the independent farmers who advocated for the plant for years, and grow small amounts. “I will definitely not be using anything” from one of the big outfits, Jackett said. “If I don’t have enough of my own then I’ll be getting it from somebody else whom I trust.”Underscoring how confusing it all is, a few alarms are being sounded that there won’t be enough to pass around on Day One. In fact, Colorado faced some shortages of legal supplies in the first year. A similar rush emptied shelves in Nevada, where sales started on July 1.By 2015, Colorado had the opposite problem, according to Denver-based researcher Marijuana Policy Group, with supplies approximately 51 per cent larger than demand. The average price sought by wholesalers for recreational flower has fallen 52 per cent since lawful sales began, according to Cannabase.None of this has dampened enthusiasm in some quarters in Canada. MedReleaf has raised $100 million, all of which is going toward expanding capacity, said Chief Executive Officer Neil Closner. He said the disappointing IPO was due to a general market slowdown and “not a reflection of demand for our product.” Like others in the business, he is confident Canadians will be keen enough to lawfully imbibe that the blossoming industry will be supported.Bent, the pot farmer outside Winnipeg, is just as upbeat. Surveying part of his crop, in a room brimming with 30 bushy plants ripening under the glow of hot lamps, he said the oft-misunderstood reefer is definitely going mainstream. Even his cousin, a “religious librarian,” became a convert after experimenting in Denver, he said. “These are people who would never, ever try it” if it were illegal.“It’s really gaining popularity and really starting to lose that stigma,” Bent said. “I see a lot of money being spent.”–With assistance from Jennifer KaplanBloomberg "
