Although cannabis is legal in several states, it remains illegal at the federal level.But co-founders Sean McNulty and Peter Hatziioannou say regulatory reform is already underway and they are keeping tabs on potential U.S. opportunities through XIB Consulting Inc., their outside consulting firm.\u201cIf Canopy Rivers could invest its own capital into the States, you would see one or both of us go all in on Canopy Rivers,\u201d McNulty said in an interview at the company\u2019s Toronto office. Because it can\u2019t just yet, the company keeps itself \u201cvery plugged into other ideas, competitors and opportunities\u201d through XIB, he added.McNulty and Hatziioannou, who met on the M&A advisory desk at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and have worked together on and off for over a decade, created XIB in 2016 to provide advisory services to a sector that had plenty of entrepreneurs but little capital markets experience.Canopy Growth was XIB\u2019s first client and quickly became a large portion of its business. The Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company is worth $10.8 billion (US$8.2 billion), making it the world\u2019s second-biggest marijuana company by market value. However, McNulty and Hatziioannou found they were turning down investments because Canopy was only interested in companies it could own and operate.\u201cWe decided to create a separate vehicle where we would could take minority interests, create alternative transaction structures and provide both growth capital and strategic support,\u201d McNulty said.That vehicle became Canopy Rivers, which is about 25 per cent owned by Canopy Growth and counts chief executive officer Bruce Linton as its acting CEO and chairman. Canopy Rivers listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in September via a reverse takeover after raising $104 million in a private placement. It closed Friday with a market value of $685 million, down 54 per cent since it\u2019s listing on Sept. 20.Canopy Rivers\u2019 portfolio consists of 11 companies including Civilized Worldwide Inc., a cannabis media and lifestyle brand, LiveWell Foods Canada Inc., a nutritional company that sells hemp products, and Canapar Italy, a firm that works with Sicilian farmers to cultivate hemp.Another holding, a Canadian licensed producer called TerrAscend Corp., will give Canopy Rivers an indirect entree into the U.S. market that could act as a model for future U.S. investments.TerrAscend wants to expand into the U.S. market through acquisitions and is able to do so because it\u2019s listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, which allows U.S.-focused pot firms. However two of its largest shareholders, the Canopy companies, wouldn\u2019t be able to remain shareholders because of their exchange restrictions. To solve this problem, the two Canopys agreed to convert their common shares in TerrAscend into exchangeable shares, which can\u2019t be transferred or monetized and aren\u2019t entitled to voting rights or dividends. If U.S. federal law changes, they can be converted back into common shares.\u201cIt was important for us to try to make sure that we maintained our investor base and kept them happy,\u201d TerrAscend CEO Michael Nashat said in an interview. \u201cWe see the U.S. market as the next big boom and now we can pursue this opportunity.\u201dIf the arrangement is approved by TerrAscend shareholders, which is expected to happen by the end of the month, it could set a compelling precedent for other U.S.-related transactions, McNulty said.Meanwhile, there are no shortage of other investment opportunities for Canopy Rivers to consider.\u201cThe deal flow is sometimes overwhelming,\u201d McNulty said. \u201cWe\u2019ve evaluated hundreds and hundreds of opportunities but we\u2019re very picky because we\u2019re trying to get it right for every investment.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Canadian stocks set for worst month in 7 years \u2014 but that beats the States", "description": "Even with today\u2019s rally it\u2019s been a brutal month for stocks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-pot-stocks-banks-lead-plunge-in-worst-month-since-2011", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/stocks1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 31, 2018 1:44 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian stocks are headed for the worst month in seven years after both the staid banking sector and newfangled cannabis stocks bruised the main index.Together, financial and pot stocks accounted for 31 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s decline this month, with the two sectors contributing 364 points of the 1,179-point drop in the S&P/TSX Composite Index through Oct. 30.

Generally speaking, higher rates are good for bank margins but in Canada they\u2019ve also raised concerns about elevated household debt levels. The Canadian market has taken an additional hit from the recent rout in cannabis shares, which began one day before the country legalized recreational pot on Oct. 17.

This has exacerbated a longer-term slump in the commodity-heavy small-cap index that has seen it lose about 80 per cent from its 2007 high amid weakness in Canadian crude and metals prices.The outsized influence of pot stocks is an indication of how the benchmark\u2019s composition has changed over time as resource stocks declined. The S&P/TSX Venture is 41 per cent materials, 21 per cent health care, which includes cannabis, and 13 per cent energy. In October 2011, it was 51 per cent materials and 23 per cent energy with health care accounting for just 2 per cent.There are similarities between small-cap resource stocks and cannabis companies, said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Toronto-based Baskin Wealth Management, which has over $1.1 billion in assets under management.\u201cAny company that doesn\u2019t make any money or has an extremely low market cap or no free cash flow, they\u2019re in the realm of speculation,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI think all those pot stocks on the Venture Exchange are completely worthless.\u201dI think all those pot stocks on the Venture Exchange are completely worthlessBetween them, The Supreme Cannabis Co., Organigram Holdings Inc., Auxly Cannabis Group Inc., Newstrike Brands Ltd., Aleafia Health Inc., Vivo Cannabis Inc., WeedMD Inc., Emerald Health Therapeutics Inc., Radient Technologies Inc. and Aldershot Resources Ltd. contributed 30.49 points, or about 39 per cent of the S&P/TSX Venture\u2019s 78.97-point decline in the fourth quarter.Cannabis shares have been tumbling since just before Canada legalized recreational pot use on Oct. 17, ending a two-month rally that resulted in sky-high valuations and drew comparisons to the dot-com bubble or bitcoin.

Despite those calls, the value of Canadian energy deals has declined this year, in contrast to a surge south of the border.However, the recent plunge in heavy Canadian crude to less than US$20 a barrel may spark a wave of consolidation, bringing buyers off the sidelines and causing \u201ccapitulation\u201d among entrenched management teams of smaller producers, said Martin Pelletier, a portfolio manager at TriVest Wealth Counsel in Calgary.\u201cIf I\u2019ve got a good balance sheet, if I\u2019m a well-run company with a process that works, why wouldn\u2019t I look to take advantage of this environment?\u201d Pelletier said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no better time than when management teams have been beaten up, investors have completely lost patience in the sector, oil prices are in the toilet and you\u2019ve got a very large differential that may not be sustainable.\u201dPelletier said his firm has moved 25 per cent of its energy investments back into Canada \u2014 after temporarily abandoning the country \u2014 to buy into possible takeout candidates whose shares have been beaten into \u201cdeep value\u201d territory by the widening differentials.

WCS rebounded on Friday, narrowing the discount to US$48.50.That slide has weighed on Canadian energy shares. The S&P/TSX Energy Index dropped 7.8 percent this year through Friday, compared with a 1.3 per cent gain for the comparable U.S. index.The value of acquisitions involving Canadian energy companies has plunged as well, falling 16 per cent to US$55.8 billion in the first nine months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding US$23.6 billion tied to Enbridge Inc.\u2019s roll up of partnerships and other units, the total falls to US$32.2 billion, which would be a 51 per cent drop from the same period last year.By contrast, the value of U.S. energy deals has surged 72 per cent to US$300.2 billion.Cheap Canadian oil and stocks already are luring buyers.

So if you survive this short-term pain, the long-term gain is very big.\u201dStill, despite the slumping oil prices, many acquisition targets may resist being taken over because they don\u2019t want to sell with their valuations so depressed, said Rafi Tahmazian, who helps manage about $1 billion in investments at Canoe Financial in Calgary. Management teams also may fear for their ability to find work again or start up a new company in an inhospitable market, he said.\u201cIn Canada, it\u2019s a bit of a desert after you get sold,\u201d Tahmazian said. \u201cPsychologically, I think that\u2019s a factor playing into this.\u201dHusky Energy Inc. cited its immunity to the widening differentials in its hostile cash-and-stock bid for MEG Energy Corp. Channeling MEG\u2019s output into its refining system would maximize the value of each barrel of crude produced, benefiting MEG investors who currently are exposed to those weaker prices, Husky said.While MEG may reject Husky\u2019s bid and seek higher offers, the wider differentials may ultimately prompt investors to pressure MEG into accepting a deal, Pelletier said. And if similar scenarios play out across the industry, it could draw major investors back into the sector, rather than just short-term traders trying to play off the volatility, he said.\u201cTo get the long-term money back in like it was in the old days, it\u2019s going to take a fundamental shift,\u201d Pelletier said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of catalyst, and it could be mass consolidation.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Danielle Bochove.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Gregory Calderone, Sarah Ponczek and Kasper Viita", "title": "No end in sight to stock slump as traders say \u2018bad day\u2019 was overdue", "description": "Wall Street\u2019s worst daily loss in eight months is reverberating around the globe", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/no-end-in-sight-to-stock-rout-as-traders-say-bad-day-was-overdue", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/trader.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 11, 2018 11:51 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks fell for a sixth day Thursday, extending the longest losing streak of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, as an early rally in tech folded and energy shares plunged.

Canada\u2019s biggest engineering and construction company said it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the government\u2019s position and is reviewing appeal options.The rejection of settlement talks increases the threat to SNC\u2019s business, especially if the graft allegations hang over the company\u2019s reputation and impair its ability to win new construction contracts. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged SNC in 2015 with attempted bribery and fraud related to projects in Libya. The builder said at the time that it would \u201cvigorously\u201d defend itself.\u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d said Chris Murray, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital in Toronto. An unwillingness by prosecutors to negotiate an agreement \u201cprolongs the uncertainty around the timing of the conclusion of this matter,\u201d while \u201craising questions around SNC\u2019s ability to bid on future federal government contracts.\u201dSNC sank 14 per cent to $44.58 at 3:01 p.m. in Toronto after sliding as much as 15 percent for the biggest intraday decline since February 2012. SNC\u2019s drop was the largest on the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which fell 1.6 per cent.SNC would risk becoming a takeover candidate if its stock swoon is prolonged, Murray said.\u201cIf the company continues to trade at depressed valuations, it may be forced to look at strategic alternatives,\u201d he said.The public prosecutor\u2019s office determined that the criteria for remediation agreements set out by the country\u2019s criminal code \u201cwere not met,\u201d said spokeswoman Nathalie Houle, in response to questions about SNC. She didn\u2019t elaborate.Canada recently adopted a system, similar to mechanisms in other Group of Seven nations, that allows companies to defer prosecution in exchange for fines, remediation and cooperation. SNC had hoped to use the system, saying it allows for the \u201cfair, effective and globally competitive resolution of issues for Canadian corporations.\u201dSince 2012, SNC-Lavalin has taken steps to improve its ethics and compliance while overhauling its senior leadership team. Chief Executive Officer Neil Bruce told analysts in August that the company was \u201coptimistic\u201d about being invited to settlement talks by prosecutors.Absent an agreement, SNC will probably proceed through the court system to fight the criminal charges, which could take \u201cseveral years,\u201d Derek Spronck, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.If the company is found guilty, the SNC units that are charged would be barred from bidding on Canadian government contracts for 10 years and \u201cface a fine that would not exceed the benefit acquired from the illegal activity,\u201d Spronck said.The Mounties have indicated that the benefit was $150 million to $200 million (US$115 million to US$150 million), Spronck said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo and Doug Alexander", "title": "All of a sudden things are looking up for Canadian investors", "description": "The flurry of developments on trade and energy lift an overhang that has held back business investment and growth in the world's 11th biggest economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/the-buy-canada-trade-is-on-with-nafta-deal-clinched-lng-on-way", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/chrystia-freeland.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 1, 2018 9:39 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian assets may finally begin to feel some love.A deal to join the U.S. and Mexico in a reworked North American trade pact, news that Royal Dutch Shell Plc and its partners are poised to move ahead with a liquefied natural gas project on the country\u2019s west coast, and an offer for a Canadian energy company point to gains ahead for the country\u2019s stock market and currency.\u201cThis is very upbeat news, there was a lot of NAFTA uncertainty weighing on economy, stocks, with equities underperforming,\u201d Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a phone interview.

Still, that\u2019s no match for a U.S. economy seen having more runway than Canada\u2019s, thanks in part to Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts.Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has gained 13 per cent in the past 12 months, lagging the 21 per cent increase of the U.S. KBW Bank Index.\u201cCanadian banks are run well and everything, but where they\u2019re sitting in our view is not as attractive as where our U.S. banks are in terms of opportunity,\u201d said Tony Scherrer, director of research and portfolio manager with Seattle-based Smead Capital Management.U.S. banks are well positioned for a lending revival fuelled by a strong U.S. economy and a millennial generation approaching their homebuying years \u2014 an emerging opportunity as lending in Canada slows, Scherrer said. \u201cThey\u2019re ripe and ready and able to lend, but we\u2019re in the very early innings of seeing those animal spirits kick in.\u201dU.S. banks \u2014 and even some Canadian ones with U.S. operations \u2014 are also getting a boost from U.S. tax cuts signed into law in December.

The U.S. economy is expected to expand 2.9 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year, outpacing forecasts of 2 per cent for Canada this year and 1.9 per cent in 2019, according to economists.Uncertainty surrounding the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement may be weighing on Canadian stocks, along with lingering fears about the country\u2019s housing market and overindebted consumers, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said in an interview.\u201cI think all of those things would weigh on Canadian stocks relative to U.S. stocks,\u201d Glass said.U.S. investors, who learned hard lessons a decade ago during the U.S. subprime debacle and financial crisis, may be spooked by the rapid growth of mortgages and loans at Canadian banks that fueled overheated housing markets and contributed to near record levels of household debt, according to Edward Jones & Co. analyst Jim Shanahan.\u201cAlthough the banks continue to put up these amazing numbers, the stocks never really get away from us because of just broader concerns in the market,\u201d Shanahan said in a phone interview from St. Louis. \u201cThere\u2019s an undercurrent of fear in the U.S. as it relates to dramatic growth in residential real estate lending, because we lived through it and it was horrible.\u201dStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore the superiority of the Canadian banks on measures such as return on equity and profit margins. In these areas, Canadian lenders including Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and CIBC are clear winners.Canadian bank shares are more expensive than those of U.S. lenders, having fetched a premium over U.S. lenders for a dozen years. The Canadian banks index is trading at about 2.4 times tangible book value per share versus 2.0 times for the KBW Index of U.S. lenders.\u201cThe U.S. economy has been performing very well for the last few years and they\u2019ve had a slightly less difficult regulatory environment to deal with.

The deceleration ends CIBC\u2019s three-year streak of outpacing Canada\u2019s other large lenders on mortgage growth.

CIBC\u2019s growth has cooled since it stopped expanding its team of mobile-mortgage advisers that fuelled a surge in home-loan balances, with year-over-year growth peaking last year at around 12 per cent. Government measures to slow Canada\u2019s heated housing market, including tougher mortgage-qualification rules imposed in January, have also affected demand.Net income for the quarter rose 25 per cent to $1.37 billion, or $3.01 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $2.60, a year earlier, CIBC said in a statement. Adjusted profit, which excludes some items, was $3.08 a share, compared with the $2.93 average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank increased its quarterly dividend 2.3 per cent to C$1.36 a share.Shares of CIBC rose 0.8 per cent to $122.74 at 10:41 a.m. in Toronto, its highest intraday price since Jan. 22 and the best performance in the S&P/TSX Canadian Banks Index. The stock has gained 0.2 per cent this year, compared with the 2.4 per cent advance of the eight-company index.On Wednesday, Royal Bank posted third-quarter profit that beat estimates on gains in wealth management, capital markets and personal-and-commercial banking. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal are scheduled to report results on Aug. 28, followed by National Bank of Canada on Aug. 29 and Toronto-Dominion Bank on Aug. 30.Here\u2019s a summary of CIBC\u2019s results:Revenue rose 11 per cent to $4.55 billion from a year earlier, while non-interest expenses increased 4.9 per cent to $2.57 billion.The bank set aside $241 million for soured loans, up 15 per cent from a year earlier due mainly to higher losses in its CIBC FirstCaribbean bank.Earnings from Canadian personal and small business banking climbed 14 per cent to $639 million.Canadian commercial banking and wealth management profit rose 20 per cent to $350 million.U.S. commercial banking and wealth, including contributions from its PrivateBank takeover, were $162 million, compared with $41 million a year ago.Capital markets earnings increased 5.2 per cent to $265 million.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Scotts Miracle-Gro wants to know if its fertilizer can help pot plants grow", "description": "A subsidiary of the company has teamed up with Canadian pot producer Flowr Corp. to build a 50,000-square-foot research facility in B.C.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/scotts-miracle-gro-wants-to-know-if-its-fertilizer-can-help-pot-plants-grow?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/pot.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 23, 2018 9:13 AM EDT", "content": "Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. is betting its fertilizer can help cultivate a different kind of grass.Hawthorne Gardening Co., a subsidiary of the Marysville, Ohio-based company best known for its garden products, has teamed up with Canadian pot producer Flowr Corp. to build a 50,000-square-foot research facility in British Columbia.

Still, the company generates about 90 per cent of its sales from the cannabis industry, not including its AeroGrow indoor-gardening business.\u201cWe\u2019re forced to go through this flawed process, selling products without testing them on the actual crops,\u201d Hagedorn said. \u201cCannabis is such a complex and poorly understood plant at this phase of its evolution that it doesn\u2019t seem super satisfying to test it on petunias.\u201dFlowr\u2019s president and co-founder Tom Flow was also a co-founder of MedReleaf Corp., which was acquired by Aurora Cannabis Inc. in July for about US$2.2 billion in stock. He brought several members of the MedReleaf team to Flowr, which is focused on producing consistent, high-quality plants that don\u2019t need irradiation to deal with mould or pests \u2014 qualities that appealed to Hawthorne.

By contrast, Klein estimated that the industry average is closer to 100.Flowr, which will list on the TSX Venture Exchange next month via a reverse takeover, has signed supply agreements with the Ontario and B.C. governments ahead of legalization.

The result is that thousands of names, complete addresses and details on the value and price of each investment is posted on what\u2019s known as a Form 9. There were 5,845 such forms publicly available on the CSE\u2019s website on Aug. 3.The CSE disclosures raise personal privacy concerns, said Frank Allen, executive director of FAIR Canada, an investor rights group.\u201cThe extent of personal investor information required by the CSE\u2019s Form 9 is disturbing and in our view goes beyond the level of information necessary for the CSE to discharge its private placement regulatory mandate,\u201d Allen said in an email, noting that the parallel disclosure form required under Canadian securities laws keeps investors\u2019 personal information confidential.In one recent example, a June 22 private placement by Chemistree Technology Inc., more than 130 names, addresses and amounts invested were published on the site. The investments in the Vancouver-based pot company ranged from 10,000 to 425,000 shares, at 35 cents each. Under a private placement, shares are sold directly to investors rather than through a public offering.The policy has been an annoyance for some. Tarik Elsaghir, president of Cedar Point Capital Inc., a family office in Calgary, said he\u2019s received unsolicited pitches on other stocks from people who got his firm\u2019s information off the CSE\u2019s website. A Form 9 filed on June 15 shows Cedar Point bought 500,000 shares of Tidal Royalty Corp. at 33 cents a share. Tidal and Chemistree didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.\u201cPeople start cold-calling you and soliciting you on other products and other deals and you can tell they got it\u201d from the CSE, he said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat is the purpose of this and why do they have to publish everything? It might be too much information.\u201dIndividual buyers in these private placements tend to be wealthy, getting \u201caccredited\u201d investor exemptions, meaning they have personal financial assets of more than $1 million or income of at least $200,000.Even celebrities sometimes show up in the filings. Los Angeles Kings defenceman Dion Phaneuf of the National Hockey League, who has also played for Toronto, Ottawa and Calgary, bought 500,000 shares of Tidal Royalty for an investment of $165,000, according to a CSE filing. Tidal provides commercial financing services to cannabis companies. Phaneuf didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment through his agent.The Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange, both owned by TMX Group Ltd., don\u2019t publish the personal data of investors. In separate rules for private placements, Canadian securities regulators stipulate that they will collect but won\u2019t publish investors\u2019 names and addresses.\u201cFAIR Canada believes it would be timely for the CSE to update and harmonize its Form 9 information requirements with these statutory disclosure requirements for private placements,\u201d Allen said.Richard Carleton, chief executive officer of CSE\u2019s parent company CNSX Markets Inc., said the policy was put in place to ensure more transparency around participants in private placements.Carleton said the Toronto-based CSE is looking to revise the rule after receiving feedback from issuer companies, exempt market dealers and investors supporting a change in the policy. The exchange plans to publish for public comment amendments that would remove the requirement for companies to disclose the names, addresses and number of shares acquired by arm\u2019s-length investors, he said.The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada declined to comment on the CSE specifically but noted that Canadian law generally requires organizations \u201cto obtain consent for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.\u201dFormer Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian said organizations that collect personal data need to be aware of the repercussions of publishing it, adding that including financial details \u201cheightens the risk dramatically.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always the unintended consequences of publicizing this information,\u201d she said. \u201cYou simply don\u2019t know how it can be used or used against you.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander and Erik Schatzker", "title": "Novogratz\u2019s crypto bank makes belated debut after Bitcoin plunge", "description": "Galaxy Digital LP will start trading on Toronto's TSX Venture Exchange this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/novogratzs-crypto-bank-makes-belated-debut-after-bitcoin-plunge", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/0407_biz_wire_cryptoa.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 30, 2018 3:24 PM EDT", "content": "Mike Novogratz is past the point of no return.Two days from now, his cryptocurrency-focused merchant bank, Galaxy Digital LP, will start trading on Toronto\u2019s TSX Venture Exchange. It should be a triumphant moment for the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner and a milestone for the industry, yet Novogratz is having second thoughts. He reflects on the \u201cfrustrating\u201d demands of Canadian regulators that dragged out Galaxy\u2019s listing for months and trapped his investors as Bitcoin collapsed and crypto fever cooled.\u201cIf I knew what I know now, knew the crypto markets were going to swoon as much, and it was going to take so long, I might have stayed private for another year or so and then gone public,\u201d Novogratz said in a TV interview with BNN Bloomberg in Toronto. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a mistake.\u201dWhile Novogratz said he has no regrets and remains bullish as ever on blockchain\u2019s potential to revolutionize finance, his eight-month odyssey is a cautionary tale for others looking to use Canada\u2019s capital markets as a shortcut to going public. A U.S. initial public offering would have required at least two years of audited financials, which Galaxy doesn\u2019t yet have. Instead, Novogratz is merging the firm with a shell company listed on the Toronto junior exchange via a reverse takeover.Canadian mining companies have employed that process for years. More recently, the reverse-takeover route has become popular with marijuana producers and cryptocurrency startups. When Galaxy filed for approval, regulators gave the firm extra scrutiny, pushing back its trading debut from April to August.\u201cThere was a surge of companies that listed in Canada and they all traded really poorly,\u201d Novogratz, 53, said. \u201cI think the regulators got a little bit more nervous and said, \u2018Hey, wait a minute, let\u2019s make sure we know what we\u2019re seeing here\u2019.\u201dRegulators needed to strike a balance, said Brady Fletcher, managing director of the TSX Venture Exchange: Even though Galaxy wanted to list quickly, they had to reach a comfort level with the complexity of its corporate structure and crypto more broadly.\u201cThere\u2019s a layer of due diligence that goes into figuring out and understanding the business itself, which probably takes a little bit longer than entrepreneurs like Mike would like it to, but for us that\u2019s how we maintain market integrity,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the upcoming listing and Galaxy is a great story.\u201dNovogratz is a former Wall Street macro trader who made hundreds of millions of dollars buying and selling Bitcoin and Ether. He became one of crypto\u2019s most prominent champions and decided in late 2017 to turn the business he\u2019d started in his family office into a full-service merchant bank for the blockchain and crypto community. It would trade virtual currencies, invest in related companies, manage investment funds and advise clients on deals.Galaxy sold shares at $5 apiece in a private placement in January, weeks after Bitcoin peaked. The firm, which is based in New York, is finally set to start trading Aug. 1 on the TSX Venture Exchange through a separate vehicle, Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., under the GLXY ticker. Novogratz said eventually he intends to seek stock listings in Frankfurt, London and Hong Kong.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a global company; we want to be globally traded,\u201d he said.In addition to building out his four businesses, his plans for Galaxy include expanding in Asia and Europe and raising money for a fund based on the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. Novogratz said he hopes the firm will be cash-flow positive by year-end and predicted it will be profitable on a net-income basis by the second quarter of 2019.The next few weeks may not be smooth sailing. Novogratz said investors could have a tough time putting a value on Galaxy\u2019s illiquid assets and it\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d to expect that the shares will trade at the January price now that Bitcoin has plunged about 40 per cent since then and demand for crypto investments has softened.Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. is a case in point. The Vancouver-based crypto miner has plunged 83 per cent from its November peak, after it listed last year on the junior bourse via a reverse takeover.\u201cUnfortunately, the Canadian capital markets aren\u2019t roaring anymore,\u201d Novogratz said in the interview. \u201cI have faith that they will come back.\u201d\u00a92018 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "Crude's bull run made this oilsands producer Canada's top stock", "description": "MEG Energy has more than doubled in value so far this year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/crudes-bull-run-made-this-oilsands-producer-canadas-top-stock", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meg_energy.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 12, 2018 8:41 AM EDT", "content": "For any investor who was looking to gain from rising oil prices, there may not have been a better way to play the recent bull run than MEG Energy Corp.So far this year, the Canadian oilsands producer has more than doubled in value. Its shares in Toronto are leading the 246-company S&P/TSX Composite Index and blowing away peers in the S&P/TSX energy index, which is up just 3.7 per cent. Calgary-based MEG is even beating the best-performing U.S. rivals on the S&P 500 energy index.\u201cThis is, perhaps more than any other energy equity in North America, the most levered name to oil you can think of,\u201d said Chris Cox, an analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the preferred name for anyone who\u2019s getting bullish on oil and trying to get exposure.\u201dMEG\u2019s surge has been driven by its status as a pure-play heavy-oil producer, churning out about 93,000 barrels a day from Alberta\u2019s Athabasca oilsands, at a time when falling production from Venezuela and Mexico has left U.S. Gulf Coast refiners hunting for more heavy crude. The situation has pushed up the price of Western Canada Select almost 50 per cent this year, about triple the 16 per cent gain for more expensive West Texas Intermediate light oil.By contrast, Canada\u2019s other major oilsands players all produce some natural gas or have refining operations that dilute their benefit from rising heavy-oil prices. MEG also is carrying a higher-than-average debt load, making it more vulnerable to crude prices when they drop but more dramatically improving its prospects in a rally like this year\u2019s.While MEG\u2019s hefty borrowing was exactly what had led many investors to shy away from the stock, the company addressed concerns over its indebtedness earlier this year by selling its stakes in the Access Pipeline and the Stonefell Terminal oil-storage facility for $1.61 billion (US$1.2 billion). The shares jumped 13 per cent the day that deal was announced.Though the company still has debt of more than four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 more than peers like Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. \u2014 Cox said the asset sales made MEG much more \u201cpalatable\u201d for investors.\u201cThat gave the market the comfort to take the risk on the story on the basis that oil goes higher, without the balance sheet being so challenging that you couldn\u2019t get around it,\u201d he said.MEG will start generating free cash flow next year and should work its debt down to about two times Ebitda, in line with peers, by 2020, said John Rogers, MEG\u2019s head of investor relations. The company also is ramping up production to 113,000 barrels a day by 2020, which will increase its ability to generate cash, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ll basically be growing into our debt,\u201d Rogers said.However, there are risks ahead. Company founder Bill McCaffrey retired as chief executive officer in May, and MEG is searching for a successor who will continue to execute on the company\u2019s strategy. The transportation system in western Canada remains fragile, even though MEG currently has capacity to move a third of its output to refiners on the Gulf Coast.As for oil, OPEC and its allies recently pledged to increase production by 1 million barrels a day, while a trade war between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest consumers of crude, dims the outlook for growing demand. Prices for the WTI benchmark in the U.S. plunged 5 per cent on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s government announced tariffs on another US$200 billion of Chinese-made products. MEG fell 4.6 per cent.Plus, the producer\u2019s rally this year to $10.78 Wednesday still leaves it more than 80 per cent off its high of almost $53 seven years ago, and the company remains a money loser for China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd., its biggest shareholder.That\u2019s not to mention that the run-up in MEG\u2019s shares has stretched its valuation. The stock is trading at an enterprise value of about eight times next year\u2019s estimated Ebitda. That\u2019s higher than the ratio of 6.8 times at Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources. Cox downgraded MEG\u2019s shares to the equivalent of a hold last week, based solely on its valuation.For his part, MEG\u2019s Rogers says the company\u2019s value hasn\u2019t been fully realized. MEG is boosting its production amid rising oil prices with an improved balance sheet and free cash flow on the horizon, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re still kind of in the early innings of this game, in terms of this entire recovery,\u201d Rogers said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re fully valued today at all.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Frederic Tomesco", "title": "Bombardier is rallying on Airbus deal, luxury jets \u2014 and the party's just getting started", "description": "CEO's turnaround effort still has miles to go, but his moves to shore up liquidity, cut jobs and ally with Airbus have increasingly won over investors", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/bombardier-is-rallying-on-airbus-deal-luxury-jets-and-the-partys-just-getting-started", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/bombardier_ceo.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 11, 2018 1:00 PM EDT", "content": "Bombardier Inc. is flying high \u2014 and analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to AltaCorp Capital Inc. say the rally has plenty of room to continue.The Canadian planemaker is heading for its biggest annual stock gain in almost three decades, only two years after its shares dipped below $1. The private-jet market is rebounding just in time for the debut of the company\u2019s swanky Global 7000.

They also boast the best return among 48 global aerospace companies with a market value of at least US$500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Doerksen has an outperform rating on Bombardier stock, which he predicts could reach $6 within 12 months.Bombardier expects to break even on a cash flow basis, plus or minus US$150 million, for all of 2018. The company reaffirmed the forecast when it released its first-quarter results on May 3 and announced the sale of its Downsview property near Toronto for US$635 million cash.Rising demand for business jets and trains, Bombardier\u2019s two biggest lines of business, are two factors stoking investor enthusiasm.Private plane orders climbed in the first quarter from the previous three-month period, ending a slump of almost two years. Inventories of used business aircraft, meanwhile, are near their lowest in more than a decade.Bombardier is working toward the service debut of its most advanced ultra-long-range business jet, the renamed Global 7500, in this year\u2019s second half. Montreal-based Bombardier is banking on the plane, which will sell for about US$73 million, to contribute about US$3 billion in annual revenue at the start of the next decade.\u201cThe business jet market is continuing to increase, and the Global 7500 looks like it\u2019s going to enter service on time,\u201d AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said. \u201cMeanwhile, their train business is moving to an inflection point, and you should see acceleration of cash flows in the back half of the year. You put all of this together and you see some rationale for the story to improve.\u201dMurray raised his rating on Bombardier to outperform from sector perform last week, boosting his 12-month target price to $6.50 \u2014 a 44 per cent increase.On the commercial aircraft front, Bombardier\u2019s partnership with Airbus on the plane formerly known as the CSeries is already starting to pay dividends.On Tuesday, JetBlue unveiled firm plans to order at least 60 of Airbus\u2019s A220 jets \u2014 the new name for the former CSeries aircraft. The sale is the first since Airbus took control of the program last week from Bombardier.\u201cThe CSeries is now in stronger hands with Airbus, and we just got an illustration of that yesterday,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAirbus\u2019s involvement will likely drive additional orders.

MEG Energy Corp. was the top-performing S&P/TSX stock in the second quarter, rising 141 per cent.Ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations coupled with U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, retaliatory measures from Canada, and the more dire threat of U.S. duties on autos are making investors nervous, but trade fears will ultimately be overlooked by strong fundamentals, Bangsund said. She sees the most upside in value stocks including energy, financials and materials \u2014 the three largest sectors on the S&P/TSX, which together account for about two-thirds of the benchmark.Tightening global crude supply, improving fundamentals and the persistent underperformance of the sector means the rally in Canadian energy stocks \u201cis likely to be more extended than our previous assumptions,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note last week, raising his rating on the sector to overweight from market weight.

The country\u2019s stock market just hit a record, surpassing a January high before its bigger, brasher U.S. cousin.But look at the longer-term picture and there\u2019s less to get fired up about. Since the financial-crisis low of March 9, 2009, the S&P/TSX Composite Index has gained 117 per cent compared with an increase of 309 per cent for the S&P 500 Index. And Canada is expected to lag again in 2018, with strategists forecasting a full-year gain of about 5 per cent versus 10 per cent for the S&P 500.The Canadian index fell 0.2 per cent to 16,392.90 at 9:31 a.m. in Toronto. It\u2019s no secret that Canada\u2019s stock market suffers from a lack of diversification, with too much exposure to cyclical commodity stocks and not enough growth drivers like technology and health care. But some of the country\u2019s business leaders say the reasons for its long-term underperformance go deeper than that: a lack of risk capital, too few independent investment dealers, and uncompetitive tax policy.In Canada, it\u2019s not so easy to bring new companies to market.Nearly 50 independent investment dealers have closed shop in the past five years due to higher operating costs and weak commodity markets, and consolidation will only accelerate over the next several years, said Ian Russell, president of the Investment Industry Association of Canada.That means fewer options for companies that want to go public, pushing them to other sources of funding like private equity and venture capital, or to acquisitions by larger competitors. Investors are then left with fewer opportunities to diversify into underrepresented, high-growth sectors like technology \u2014 the real standout of U.S. markets.There were 14 initial public offerings worth more than US$75 million on the Toronto Stock Exchange last year and four so far this year, down from 30 in 2007 when commodities were booming, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental issue with the lack of people like ourselves to help entrepreneurial companies raise money and to help small-cap IPOs happen,\u201d Dan Daviau, chief executive officer of independent dealer Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office earlier this year. \u201cThat to me is not healthy for the Canadian capital markets. In the U.S. we would have 30 competitors that could do different flavors of what we do.\u201dThose that are listed have a harder time raising equity capital for acquisitions and growth, keeping stock prices depressed, according to Russell. There have been seven secondary share offerings in Canada worth a total of US$756 million year-to-date versus 23 worth US$2.2 billion in 2007, according to Bloomberg data.As the investment dealers have shrunk, the banks have stepped in, but they tend to ignore the smallest companies, Russell said. Canada\u2019s five largest banks accounted for about two-thirds of equity and equity-linked issuances in 2017 compared with less than half in 2008, the data show.Take the cannabis sector. Canaccord has led equity financings in the industry, which the big banks were loathe to touch. Now that the industry is well established and Canada is legalizing pot for recreational use, the big banks are beginning to elbow in.Tom Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Financial Ltd. and CEO of Urbana Corp., is blunt about the implications of Canada\u2019s shrinking pool of independent dealers and the creeping influence of banks.\u201cThey acquire, absorb and obliterate,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a tremendous impact on job creation, economic growth and innovation.\u201dCanada\u2019s tax regime also stunts corporate investment through special tax breaks and subsidies that are only available to small businesses, discouraging them from growing past a certain size, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc., calling the system \u201cabsolutely perverse.\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau last year tried to crack down on the use of private corporations, a structure small-business owners frequently use to reduce taxes, but a backlash prompted him to retreat.\u201cWhen you have a system in Canada where you reward small, you stay small,\u201d Rosenberg said.To be sure, the burgeoning marijuana sector has created a new stable of publicly traded companies, which helped lead the S&P/TSX to a record high Wednesday after Canada\u2019s upper house voted to approve the legalization of recreational pot. Canopy Growth Corp. rose 6.7 per cent to $45.36, a record high, giving it a market value of $9 billion.Canada has also produced some successful, innovative firms like Shopify Inc. In fact, the tech sector, which accounts for just 4 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, is leading its peers by a long shot, up 31 per cent year-to-date.Canada actually ranks fifth out of 54 countries in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor for perceived opportunities for entrepreneurs \u2014 but it\u2019s not good at turning that innovation into commercial success, said Jos Schmitt, CEO of Aequitas Innovations Inc., which runs a Toronto-based stock exchange.Schmitt blames a lack of risk capital and too few Canadians with the right managerial and commercialization skills. He suggests making it easier for U.S. broker-dealers to access the Canadian market and providing more support to publicly traded companies. Without that, Canada\u2019s stock market is doomed to continue its underperformance, he said.\u201cA lack of risk capital either leads companies to go somewhere else \u2014 and that is often the U.S. where they can find the private risk capital, where they can find the talent they need. Or it leads them to go public too quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither of those two solutions is a good one ultimately for our economy.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Scott DeveauBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "TD overtakes RBC for first time in 6 years, becoming Canada's premium bank", "description": "Toronto-Dominion's returns more than doubled its rival, eliminating the premium Royal Bank shares enjoyed for the better part of a decade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/rbc-loses-its-luster-as-investors-make-td-canadas-premium-bank", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/td-rbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 21, 2018 12:11 PM EDT", "content": "Royal Bank\u2019s pain is TD\u2019s gain.Shares of Royal Bank of Canada are losing ground to its biggest rival, Toronto-Dominion Bank, which rose to a record on Wednesday. Toronto-Dominion\u2019s returns more than doubled its Canadian competitor in the past year, eliminating the premium Royal Bank shares enjoyed for the better part of a decade.\u201cThe pendulum has swung a bit more negative on Royal Bank,\u201d John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Plc, said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no one definitive thing that says Royal\u2019s outlook is now being tarnished relative to TD\u2019s. It just looks like we\u2019re getting a shifting preference in the marketplace.\u201dRoyal Bank\u2019s stock valuation, measured by share price to tangible book value, has tended to carry a premium over other Canadian banks for the past decade. Toronto-Dominion did hold a higher valuation from the early 2000s up until the financial crisis \u2014 a period when it was buying U.S. banks. Since November 2012 it\u2019s been all RBC, until the past month.Toronto-Dominion shares have surged 18 per cent in the past 12 months while Royal Bank gained 7.1 per cent. The eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index rose 8.8 per cent in the period. Royal Bank closed at $100.44 in regular Toronto trading on Wednesday, while Toronto-Dominion hit a record $76.74.\u201cOur strong performance is reflective of a consistent customer-focused strategy,\u201d Toronto-Dominion spokeswoman Alison Ford said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe continue to focus on investing in our transformation to deliver for our customers.\u201dRoyal Bank declined to comment on the relative stock performance and change in premium.\u201cIt\u2019s just investors going to TD for the bigger U.S. exposure, not necessarily something against Royal,\u201d said Steve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7 billion including banks.Canada\u2019s two largest lenders dominate domestic banking, but differ in their strategies abroad. Royal Bank\u2019s U.S. strength lies with its capital-markets division based in New York and a wealth-management operation that houses City National, a private and commercial lender dubbed Hollywood\u2019s \u201cbank to the stars.\u201d Toronto-Dominion bet on U.S. retail banking starting in 2005, spending $17 billion on takeovers to assemble a branch network from Maine to Florida.Royal Bank\u2019s shares took a hit following its second-quarter earnings report on May 24, and fell for five straight days, even as profit exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates. Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan called the earnings a \u201clower-quality beat.\u201d While they have since rebounded, shares remain below the record close of $108.05 set Jan. 22.\u201cUsually when RBC beats by a lot it\u2019s because of the capital markets,\u201d Belisle said. \u201cSo far this year, it hasn\u2019t been a very strong year.\u201dEight analyst rate Royal Bank shares a buy, while another eight rate it a hold and two, including Aiken, say the stock is a sell. Aiken sees the stock\u2019s valuation as too high relative to its growth prospects. Twelve analysts rate Toronto-Dominion a buy, with four calling the stock a hold and one a sell.Royal Bank\u2019s operations leave little to complain about, according to Aiken, though investors may feel that TD is a better bet on its U.S. strategy \u2014 especially following last month\u2019s earnings reports.\u201cYou look at the resurgence of TD and we\u2019ve seen some strength in their U.S. operations, which will always get people excited,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cThe market believes that TD\u2019s growth in the U.S. should be stronger over the next little while than at Royal.\u201dRoyal Bank may be getting penalized on its domestic strengths. As Canada\u2019s largest mortgage lender, it has a 16 per cent market share when the nation\u2019s housing market is cooling and debt-laden consumers are starting to pare back borrowing.At a June 13 investor day, Royal Bank sought to publicize new digital products and other innovations. Chief Executive Officer David McKay lamented that the firm isn\u2019t convincing as many Canadians as he\u2019d like to switch banks.\u201cWe\u2019ve built an incredible franchise over time with all this sales power, yet we\u2019re frustrated,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe\u2019re No. 1, the customer tells us we\u2019re No. 1, experts like Retail Banker say we\u2019re No. 1 in the world \u2014 yet we don\u2019t think enough Canadians are using our services.\u201dAs a further indignity, TD once again stole the crown of Canada\u2019s biggest bank by assets \u2014 a rank Royal Bank has held for most of the past century. Royal Bank is still larger by market value, though even that lead is shrinking.For Manulife\u2019s Belisle, those are of little consequence \u2014 but he sees opportunity with the premium switch.\u201cIt makes quite a bit of sense to shift some money potentially from TD into Royal just for the valuation gap,\u201d Belisle said.Bank executives can find it hard to turn the tide on sentiment over the near term, but those who do things right eventually get credit, Barclays\u2019 Aiken said.\u201cYou cannot scream from the hilltops and say, \u2018We are better than everybody else, why are we not trading at the best multiple?\u2019 \u2014 that just does not happen,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cBut if you run your businesses better than everybody else, ultimately you will be rewarded.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Legal marijuana, oil send Canadian stocks to record high", "description": "'Now the economy's really coming off the boil and the TSX is back at a record high,' said one economist", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/legal-marijuana-oil-send-canadian-stocks-to-record-high", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0620tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 20, 2018 1:25 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian stocks surged to a record high on Wednesday, driven by soaring cannabis stocks and a rebound in the energy sector.The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.7 per cent to 16,424.82 at 10:09 a.m., above the intraday and closing high on Jan. 4. After a bout of volatility that sent global markets plunging in February, it took nearly six months for Canadian stocks to claw their way back to levels last seen at the beginning of the year. The S&P 500 Index is still trading about 3.6 per cent below its Jan. 26 high.\u201cIt\u2019s odd, we had the Canadian economy accelerating through about mid-2017 and the TSX was fading and lagging the U.S., and now the economy\u2019s really coming off the boil and the TSX is back at a record high,\u201d said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.Pot stocks jumped after Canada\u2019s upper house voted to approve the legalization of recreational marijuana, putting the country on track to see the drug sold in stores some time after September. Canopy Growth Corp. rose 3.3 per cent to $43.92 for a market value of $8.7 billion (US$6.5 billion) after touching a record earlier.Energy stocks, which account for about 19 percent of the index, have gained 11 per cent since the beginning of the second quarter, making them one of the primary drivers of recent gains. The smaller health-care and technology sectors have done even better, posting gains of 22 per cent and 18 per cent respectively quarter-to-date.The best-performing company year-to-date is Canada Goose Holdings Inc., up 128 per cent, followed by MEG Energy Corp. and Shopify Inc.Still, Canada\u2019s year-to-date performance is tepid at best. The benchmark is up 1.3 per cent since the beginning of 2018, putting it in the middle of the pack of developed-world stock markets. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 3.7 per cent in 2018 and Norway, the top performer, has gained 9.4 per cent.Strategists expect the S&P/TSX to end the year at 17,068, a further gain of 3.9 per cent, according to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average year-end forecast of 2,941 for the S&P 500 in the U.S., a projected gain of 6.1 per cent from current levels.Kavcic said he doesn\u2019t expect the momentum to continue, as he doesn\u2019t see oil prices rising much beyond current levels and believes tighter monetary policy and slower credit growth will weigh on Canadian financials.\u201cFundamentally, it\u2019s not a negative environment but it might argue for maybe a little bit more modest performance from here on out for Canada stocks,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "How to profit from a trade war: Buy Canadian tech, healthcare as stocks tumble", "description": "For investors in Canadian markets, technology, health care and real estate stocks, along with government bonds, are the places to park money", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/profiting-from-trade-wars-buy-tech-healthcare-as-stocks-tumble?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0620dow.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 20, 2018 10:00 AM EDT", "content": "Seeking shelter from the escalating global trade war? For investors in Canadian markets, technology, health care and real estate stocks, along with government bonds, are the places to park money until the storm passes, strategists say.Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index retreated Tuesday, joining most equity markets lower, as the U.S. and China threatened punishing tariffs on each other\u2019s imports. The loonie also tumbled while government bonds rallied.Canada may not seem like the safest place to invest in the middle of the global trade spat, given stalled NAFTA talks and new U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. But investors shouldn\u2019t flee the market entirely, said Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities.\u201cKeeping some funds in the Canadian index is not such a bad idea,\u201d Vallee said in a phone interview. \u201cThe world economy is still growing fast, demand for commodities, demand for oil \u2014 I think they will compensate over the next year for any fallout in the other sectors.\u201dHe recommends exposure to technology companies like CGI Group Inc., a fast-growing IT provider that has operations on both sides of the border and won\u2019t be seriously affected by potential tariffs. He also likes health-care stocks, real estate investment trusts and insurance companies like Power Corp. of Canada that have growing exposure to China.These sectors don\u2019t have much impact on the broader S&P/TSX, with technology and health care accounting for 4.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s weight respectively. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Canadian market as a whole will underperform. In fact, Vallee sees the S&P/TSX doing better than the S&P 500 Index in 2018, forecasting a total gain of 11 per cent for the Canadian benchmark and about 5 per cent for U.S. stocks. Canada\u2019s main equity gauge has risen less than 1 per cent this year, trailing the 3 per cent U.S. gain.\u201cA lot of companies on the U.S. stock market are exposed to trade as well, much more than the economy itself,\u201d he said. A stronger U.S. dollar will take a bite out of those companies\u2019 earnings, and U.S. stocks are also trading at higher multiples than their Canadian counterparts, he added.Canadian investors \u201care going to have to be tolerant of a lot of uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the trade negotiations,\u201d but the market still looks reasonably valued and earnings expectations continue to accelerate, said Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager of global asset allocation at Fiera Capital Corp.\u201cWe still think there\u2019s opportunity here, particularly in those later-stage sectors of the marketplace\u201d like resources and financials, said Bangsund, who sees the S&P/TSX hitting 17,300 by year-end as oil prices rise to US$72 a barrel. That implies a 5.8 per cent gain for Canadian stocks from current levels.Canadian companies with a high percentage of foreign revenue have outperformed domestic-focused companies this year and should continue to do so, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.\u201cWe believe the passage of U.S. tax reform and the associated surge in U.S. growth are likely the main drivers,\u201d he wrote.S&P/TSX firms with the highest foreign revenue exposure, excluding resource companies, include Dream Global Real Estate Investment Trust, Enghouse Systems Ltd., Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Onex Corp. and Mitel Networks Corp. Other potential winners include Boyd Group Income Fund, the auto-repair operator that gets almost 90 per cent of its revenue from the U.S. market. Boyd, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, jumped to a record high Tuesday of $119.60.Canadian firms with U.S. revenue will also benefit from a weaker loonie, which has tumbled more than 5 per cent this year. The Canadian dollar slipped to a one-year low of 75.24 U.S. cents Tuesday, and is the second-worst performer among major currencies against the U.S. greenback over the past month.Even the loonie may be finding a bottom, as most of the damage from the trade war rhetoric has been done, according to Juan Perez, a Washington-based senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. He was among the top three loonie forecasters in the first quarter, according to a Bloomberg ranking. He sees the currency rebounding from about $1.33 to the dollar.\u201cTariffs are on and off depending on tweet storms,\u201d Perez said. \u201cOil and commodities will catch a break in the second half of the year and propel the Canadian dollar to ranges of $1.295-1.305 per U.S. dollar.\u201dAs a last resort, Canadian government bonds are always a good haven. Government debt has been a beneficiary of the global flight to safety, with the yield on the country\u2019s 10-year securities falling five basis points to 2.15 per cent Tuesday, the lowest since April 9.\u2013With assistance from Maciej Onoszko.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello", "title": "Quebec's top weed supplier Hydropothecary is on the hunt for acquisitions", "description": "CEO says company interested in rivals with provincial supply contracts and companies with technology to create new pot products \u2014 even if they hail from other industries", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/quebecs-top-weed-supplier-hydropothecary-is-on-the-hunt-for-acquisitions", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0604hydro.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2018 9:21 AM EDT", "content": "Expect more deals in Canada\u2019s burgeoning marijuana sector.Quebec\u2019s largest producer Hydropothecary Corp. is exploring acquisitions to broaden its offerings or distribution footprint, according to Chief Executive Officer Sebastien St. Louis.

Alberta-based Aurora Cannabis Inc. is leading the effort to consolidate the industry, setting a record with its agreement to buy MedReleaf Corp. for about $2.9 billion (US$2.2 billion) last month. That followed its acquisition of CanniMed Therapeutics Inc. in January and several smaller deals.\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of licensed producers that are attractive from an acquisition standpoint,\u201d St. Louis said in a phone interview, while predicting consolidation will continue.

It submitted bids in other provinces such as Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, which has yet to announce its plans.The contract helped Hydropothecary shares rise about 17 per cent this year, one of the best performers among the 10 largest publicly traded marijuana companies.

Macquarie Capital Markets offers one simple answer: the housing market itself \u2014 highlighting that the share of employment tied to construction as well as finance, insurance and real estate is nearly two standard deviations above its long-term average.Tighter mortgage rules and higher interest rates have weighed on activity in formerly high-flying Canadian housing markets, with home sales in Toronto having their worst start to the year since 2009.\u201cFor downside risks to be realized, however, any potential housing-related weakness must spill over into the labour market,\u201d analyst David Doyle wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cWhile rising rates put pressure on consumer finances, job losses trigger defaults and a tightening in credit conditions that can lead to more severe economic outcomes.\u201dRoughly half of all economic weakness during recessions since the Second World War is tied to fluctuations in residential investment, he calculates, and the extent to which Canadian output and employment are currently reliant on this is \u201cunprecedented.\u201dMacquaire\u2019s best-case scenario is that the fallout, starting in 2020, will be as bad for Canada as the 2008-09 financial crisis. Worst case: The unemployment rate will spike by more than any recession since the Great Depression.In terms of employment concentration in housing-linked industries, this dependency is particularly pronounced in Ontario and British Columbia but still prevalent across the rest of the country.

It put offers on 1,500 and ended up buying about 400. This quarter, the Canadian firm expects to buy up to 600 more.Tricon has become the third-largest publicly listed landlord of U.S. single-family rentals by snapping up homes from Arizona to Florida. It now ranks behind Invitation Homes Inc., backed by Blackstone Group LP, and American Homes 4 Rent in a market it says is valued at about US$3 trillion and is still largely owned by individual investors.The demand \u201cfeels like it\u2019s insatiable,\u201d Tricon Chief Executive Officer Gary Berman said in an interview in Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cSixteen million American households rent single-family homes. So put that into perspective. That\u2019s bigger than the entire Canadian housing market.\u201dTricon is aiming to double its assets under management to US$10 billion by 2023, attracting capital from institutional investors and bringing corporate efficiency to the market. The Toronto-based company owns 15,500 rental homes in the U.S., with a value of about US$2.9 billion. That compares with more than 80,000 for Invitation Homes and about 52,000 for American Homes 4 Rent.The U.S. market for rentals has boomed as banks tightened credit standards for mortgages after the housing crash, Berman said. In today\u2019s sharing economy, there\u2019s also less stigma associated with renting, Berman said. Then there\u2019s technology, which has made it possible for businesses to buy homes and manage their properties at scale.\u201cI mean, we\u2019re buying 400 homes, and we could be buying 800 homes per quarter, one at a time,\u201d Berman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this without technology. This is a technology business.\u201dTricon is also building out its maintenance capabilities, with a fleet of trucks Berman calls a \u201cHome Depot store on wheels.\u201d That helped the company push repair and maintenance costs down to 9.7 per cent of revenues in the first quarter from 11 per cent a year earlier.Tricon targets workforce housing \u2014 for police officers, teachers and the like \u2014 that rents for an average US$1,300 per month. That compares with an average of about US$1,700 for Invitation Homes.Tricon\u2019s stock has risen about 140 per cent to a market value of $1.35 billion (US$1.05 billion) in Toronto since the company made its first foray into the U.S. six years ago. The shares have lagged Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index over the past 12 months, with an 8.7 per cent drop amid rising interest rates. The 11 analysts who follow the company rate the stock a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Tricon could make more acquisitions following its US$1.4 billion purchase of Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. last year, Berman said. If the company could \u201ccombine or acquire a large portfolio that was complementary, we\u2019d obviously want to do that,\u201d he said.The firm is also trying to draw more institutional investment into its other businesses, which include apartment development, land acquisition and home building.

That has the chiefs of Canada\u2019s big banks weighing options.\u201cIt\u2019s great to have this capital flexibility,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada Chief Executive Officer David McKay told reporters last week after the country\u2019s largest lender held its annual meeting in Toronto. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to return capital, we\u2019ll continue to grow and we have flexibility with our strong capital ratios to make an acquisition if necessary.\u201dThe average of the banks\u2019 common equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, stands at 11 per cent and would be 11.4 per cent after adjusting for capital requirement revisions made this year by Canada\u2019s bank regulator. That\u2019s up from 9 per cent in 2013 and the strongest since Canada adopted the latest global standards put in place since the financial crisis in 2008.Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions requires a minimum 8 per cent CET1 ratio for the six large banks.\u00a0The ratio is calculated by dividing a bank\u2019s highest quality capital by its risk-weighted assets. Canadian lenders have an advantage over the largest U.S. banks, which boast higher regulatory capital strength but also face additional constraints from U.S. regulators that crimp their flexibility in using capital.The banks are estimated to have $14 billion (US$11 billion) of excess capital, with Toronto-Dominion Bank holding the biggest coffer at $5.8 billion, according to Sumit Malhotra, a bank analyst at Scotia Capital. Bank of Montreal has $3 billion followed by Royal Bank at $2.1 billion, while Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce each have $1 billion of excess capital, he said.\u201cFrom an acquisition perspective, recent moves by CIBC and Scotia show that building out franchises outside Canada remains a key priority for the sector,\u201d Malhotra said. \u201cWith the CET1 ratio of TD now approaching 12 percent, we think adding scale to the U.S. banking and wealth management presence of the bank in the U.S. is clearly an area of interest.\u201dToronto-Dominion CEO Bharat Masrani, 61, said on the bank\u2019s first-quarter earnings call he\u2019d consider more credit-card deals such as those struck in the past six years with U.S. retailers Target Corp. and Nordstrom Inc., while U.S. bank takeovers along the Eastern Seaboard and southeast are \u201cparticularly attractive.\u201dRoyal Bank\u2019s McKay, 54, said acquisitions are challenging given assets are \u201cvery expensive\u201d and options within Canada are \u201climited.\u201d Still, he\u2019s interested in building on the 2015 takeover of City National, Hollywood\u2019s \u201cbank to the stars,\u201d to further U.S. expansion in commercial and private banking.Scotiabank has already taken advantage of its strength by pursuing three acquisitions since November, including its February agreement to buy Canadian money manager Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd. for $950 million and its deal to buy Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA\u2019s 68 per cent stake in a Chilean lender for $2.2 billion.\u201cWe like the optionality of a higher capital level,\u201d\u00a0CEO Brian Porter, 60, said April 10, adding that acquisitions\u00a0are \u201cpart of our strategy, and always have been.\u201dThe heads of Bank of Montreal and CIBC, the country\u2019s fourth and fifth biggest banks respectively, are putting spending on internal initiatives ahead of acquisitions. CIBC last year bought Chicago-based PrivateBank for $5 billion, the largest takeover in CIBC\u2019s 150-year history.Bank of Montreal, which also operates in the U.S. Midwest with its Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, isn\u2019t interested in going \u201cgeographically far afield,\u201d CEO Darryl White 46, said at the bank\u2019s April 5 annual meeting. \u201cBut anything within those business lines and those geographies is interesting to us.\u201dMore share buybacks by the banks may also be on the horizon \u2014 and could be a sop for investors who\u2019ve seen Canadian bank shares trail their U.S. counterparts. The eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has risen 1 per cent in the past 12 months compared with an 18 per cent advance for the 24-company KBW Bank Index of U.S. lenders.Royal Bank used excess capital to buy back 30 million shares, or 2.1 per cent of its outstanding stock in the past year. The Toronto-based lender said in February it may repurchase another 30 million shares within the year, calling such buybacks \u201ca useful tool\u201d to deploy excess capital.\u201cA strong capital position provides the banks with options,\u201d Malhotra said. \u201cWhether you use it to buy back stock, grow your business or to make acquisitions, it certainly gives management deployment flexibility.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Canopy Growth tops BCE, Manulife as marijuana stock trading ramps up", "description": "Canadian pot stocks, most with little or no revenue, are quickly becoming among the most actively traded stocks on the country's exchanges", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canopy-tops-bce-manulife-as-marijuana-stock-trading-ramps-up", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/0411canopy.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 11, 2018 12:53 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian pot stocks, most with little or no revenue, are quickly becoming among the most actively traded stocks on the country\u2019s exchanges, topping blue-chip companies like BCE Inc. and Manulife Financial Corp.Canopy Growth Corp. and Aurora Cannabis Inc. were the fourth- and fifth most-traded stocks by value on the S&P/TSX Composite Index over the past three months, with only the three biggest banks posting higher dollar volume.The two pot stocks alone combined for more than $500 million (US$394 million) a day in trading activity, providing a boost to the exchanges and to the banks that are ramping up lending and support to the nascent industry as legalization approaches this year.While the bulk of trading is done by individual investors tracking last year\u2019s surge and this year\u2019s decline, the heavy volume suggests institutional money is starting to take note of the fledgling sector that some analysts say could be worth as much as $12 billion a year in sales.On average, $291 million worth of Canopy shares and $280 million in Aurora shares traded hands on a daily basis over the last three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bristol Gate\u2019s U.S. ETF shares only two holdings with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Total Return Index, arguably the best-known U.S. dividend growth benchmark.\u201cIf you buy the Aristocrats product, it\u2019s the assumption that what worked in the past will work in the future, whereas we\u2019re looking for companies that are about to go on a sustained run of dividend growth,\u201d said Jamie Houston, manager of sales development at Bristol Gate.The Canadian ETF only has about 16 per cent of its holdings in financials, long favoured by dividend-seeking investors, versus 35 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.\u201cYou\u2019re not buying the index with either of these two products,\u201d said Capombassis. He cited the example of CVS Health Corp., which was owned by a Bristol Gate fund that was driven by the same strategy as the U.S. ETF. When Bristol Gate bought CVS in 2009, most of the conventional dividend funds ignored it because its yield was too low. But Bristol Gate\u2019s algorithm identified it as a dividend grower and, sure enough, its dividend rose by 24 per cent annually until it was sold in 2016.Bristol Gate\u2019s U.S. ETF is overweight industrials and consumer discretionary relative to the benchmark. Its holdings include Home Depot Inc., Starbucks Corp., Honeywell International Inc. and Visa Inc. Since the strategy\u2019s inception as an offering-memorandum fund in 2009, it has returned 322 per cent versus 259 per cent for the S&P 500 Total Return Index, according to Bristol Gate.The Canadian ETF is overweight consumer staples and discretionary, with holdings like Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., Canadian Tire Corp. and Maple Leaf Foods Inc. The Canadian strategy, which Bristol Gate been running with its own money since 2013, has returned 81 per cent versus 53 per cent for the S&P/TSX Total Return Index since inception.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove", "title": "Canadian marijuana and crypto companies flagged by OTC for stock promotion", "description": "OTC Markets Group has flagged 13 Canadian companies under a new system to warn investors about stock promotions", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-pot-and-crypto-stocks-among-promoters-flagged-by-otc-3", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/bitcoin3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 29, 2018 10:11 AM EDT", "content": "A blockchain company, a battery-metal explorer and a pot grower are among 13 Canadian companies being flagged by OTC Markets Group under a new system to warn investors about stock promotions.\u201cAnonymous, paid stock promotion should have no place in the public markets,\u201d R. Cromwell Coulson, chief executive officer of OTC Markets Group, which lists 10,000 companies on its exchange, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe continue to work with regulators to advocate for the modernization of promotion regulations, including requiring additional disclosure around paid stock promotion and identifying the people associated with these campaigns.\u201dThe U.S. over-the-counter exchange said it will begin placing a megaphone icon beside companies that are the subject of promotions in an effort to protect investors. Fifty-six companies display the promotion warning as of today.Paid promotions aren\u2019t illegal in Canada or the U.S., as long as they are properly disclosed to investors and don\u2019t contain false information. In practice, disclaimers are often hard to spot, especially when intermediaries are involved. Promotions typically mimic legitimate news articles.Because promoters are often based outside the U.S. and promotions are published online or sent to investors by text or email, they\u2019re difficult to regulate. In a worst-case scenario, when insiders cash out at the market peak on news that turns out to be hype, they can be classic pump-and-dumps.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pays attention to bad actors in this area. Last year, the regulator sued 27 individuals and their companies for their involvement in bogus stock promotions that appeared on SeekingAlpha.com and elsewhere.OTC Markets is also placing a shell icon beside securities it believes may be shell companies, as defined by SEC rules.The 13 Canadian companies that received OTC megaphones are:Lexington Biosciences Inc. WestKam Gold Corp. Jericho Oil Corp. Affinor Growers Inc. Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. International Battery Metals Ltd. Matica Enterprises Inc. Global Blockchain Technologies Corp. Block One Capital Inc. Tower One Wireless Corp. New Age Farm Inc. Petroteq Energy Inc. StartMonday Technology Corp.None of them immediately provided a comment on the OTC decision, except Affinor, whose CEO Nick Brusatore said the firm isn\u2019t concerned by the policy as his company is \u201cpromoting something and telling the truth.\u201d Last year, Lexington Biosciences was asked by OTC Markets to explain its stock promotions. At the time, it said it didn\u2019t pay for or review the materials.Since early 2017, OTC Markets has asked 17 Canadian companies to respond directly to questions about stock promotion, the exchange\u2019s director of corporate communications, Annmarie Gioia, said by email.In Canada, easy listing rules on the country\u2019s junior exchanges \u2014 including the use of zombie shell companies that provide access via reverse takeovers \u2014 have led to spectacular rallies in hot commodities like Bitcoin, marijuana and metals used for electric vehicles.

It\u2019s broad based, with every sector on the S&P/TSX Composite Index expanding its net debt relative to sales over the past 10 years.\u201cCompanies in Canada are not dummies,\u201d Roberge said in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using this lever to finance their buybacks, dividend increases, and M&A.\u201dOn a forward price-to-earnings basis, Canada\u2019s stock benchmark is at the cheapest relative to the S&P 500 Index since the financial crisis. But Roberge suggests looking at the ratio of enterprise value, or market capitalization plus debt, to sales. By that metric, U.S. stocks are actually slightly cheaper than their Canadian counterparts, according to Bloomberg data \u2014 a fact that may help explain why the S&P/TSX has lagged the S&P 500 for much of the past decade.\u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve been piling on more debt on balance sheets than the U.S., you invert that line and it explains much of the underperformance of Canada versus the S&P 500,\u201d Roberge said.It\u2019s not just the U.S. \u2014 Canada\u2019s EV-to-sales multiples exceed those in developed markets outside North America and emerging markets as well, Roberge said.\u201cWhen you start screening, Canada looks very, very bad relative to other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIf rates go up they will go up everywhere globally, so you want to be in a market that will be able to sustain a backup in rates and Canada will be way more vulnerable than other countries.\u201dRoberge also believes Canada isn\u2019t using that debt to its full advantage.\u201dThe problem is that not only do we have more debt but we\u2019re not even able to grow our earnings faster than the rest of world, so this leverage is not being used properly,\u201d he said.Still, he doesn\u2019t believe corporate Canada\u2019s debt loads are a concern as long as interest rates remain low, and the ratio of debt to sales appears to have stabilized, which he calls a \u201cray of light.\u201dBut if companies don\u2019t start deleveraging, he believes Canada\u2019s stocks could fall to the lowest level relative to the S&P 500 since before the tech bubble popped in 2001.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if we keep on adding more debt than the U.S., it\u2019s hard to imagine that the relative performance will turn around and stage a sustainable bounce,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maciej Onoszko, Kristine Owram and Matthew Winkler", "title": "Trump has made U.S. a much better bet than Canada: top fund managers", "description": "In Canada, a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, and fund managers are looking to the U.S. with envy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trump-tax-cuts-are-making-canadas-best-fund-managers-envious", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0316trump2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 16, 2018 3:57 PM EDT", "content": "A reinvigorated U.S. economy under Donald Trump is a better bet than Canada, where a ticking consumer-debt bomb and declining competitiveness are dragging on asset prices, according to top-performing money managers north of the border.President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and pro-business agenda have revved up growth, stocks and corporate confidence, the managers said in a panel discussion at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto offices on Wednesday. Contrast that with Canada, where minimum wage hikes and carbon levies are ratcheting up business costs as a housing boom pushes consumer credit to a near-record 170 percent of disposable income.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one thing in isolation, it\u2019s many things,\u201d said Toronto-based Noah Blackstein, whose $1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion) Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund has outperformed 554 global peers over the past 10 years. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s of benefit to Canada.\u201dCanadian stocks have trailed the U.S. for at least a decade but that gap has only widened since Trump\u2019s election. The loonie is the worst-performing major currency against the U.S. dollar this year while Canadian bonds are outperforming on expectations of slower growth. Investors expect the Bank of Canada to lag the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates as it tries to avoid pushing consumers over the edge.Consumer leverage is making Peter Kotsopoulos think twice about investing in Canadian bank debt. Kotsopoulos, chief executive officer and director of fixed income at Toronto-based MFS Investment Management Canada Ltd., prefers U.S. financials such Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. that issue loonie debt, or Maple bonds.\u201cThere is a little bit of an overhang in Canada\u2019s financial market which started to pop up a couple of years ago during the real-estate bubble,\u201d said Kotsopoulos, whose MFS Canadian Long Term Fixed Income Fund beat its domestic peers, returning 15 per cent over three years to 2017. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will seek to weaken the currency further in order to support the country\u2019s exports, Kotsopoulos said.Further adding to the country\u2019s debt concerns, Canada\u2019s most populous province, Ontario, plans to return to deficit financing after balancing its books for only the first time in a decade in 2017-18. The plan has already prompted a warning from Fitch Ratings that it could pressure the province\u2019s ratings.Part of the under-performance of Canadian stocks can be explained by the lack of innovative companies in the country\u2019s main S&P/TSX Composite index, which is dominated by the energy sector, commodities companies and banks, the fund managers said.\u201cThe lack of tech and health care has held back Canada,\u201d said Conrad Dabiet, who manages the $3.4 billion Manulife Dividend Income Fund that beat its peers in the three years ending in 2017 with a cumulative 33 per cent return. \u201cWe need to make sure we can compete globally because a lot of these businesses are global in scale and if you miss out, you don\u2019t participate in that profit gain.\u201dWhile Canada has long heralded its corporate tax advantage over the U.S., that\u2019s also disappeared. Including state taxes, the U.S. rate has tumbled to about 26 from about 39 per cent before Trump\u2019s cuts, according to Jack Mintz, an economist at the University of Calgary and one of Canada\u2019s top tax experts. That compares with about 27 per cent in Canada, including provincial levels.To be sure, Canada\u2019s federal budget deficit at less than 1 per cent of gross domestic product is in much better shape than the U.S. where the tax cuts will push it toward 5 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2019, according National Bank of Canada. The loss of key people including Gary Cohn and Rex Tillerson who had acted as stabilizing forces in the White House have injected more volatility into markets of late.But even Trump\u2019s tough line on trade doesn\u2019t unduly worry Blackstein at Dynamic Funds, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia, who sees it as an opening gambit aimed at leveling the playing field for U.S. companies abroad.\u201cThis is a business-focused president; it\u2019s a business negotiation,\u201d said Blackstein, whose global fund has about 38 per cent of its assets in the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of hyperbole, I know there\u2019s a lot of rhetoric, I know there\u2019s some 3 a.m. tweets, but it\u2019s not totally unhinged.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "ETF pioneer Som Seif to announce acquisition, new investor in plan to quintuple assets at Purpose", "description": "Seif says he's preparing for a day when new technologies, including cryptocurrencies and blockchain, might make ETFs obsolete", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/etf-pioneer-seif-to-boost-assets-with-acquisition-new-investor?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0305seif.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 5, 2018 3:32 PM EST", "content": "Canadian ETF entrepreneur Som Seif plans to announce an acquisition and new minority partner as soon as this week as he works to quintuple assets at his latest venture.Seif\u2019s goal is to grow Purpose Investments Inc.,\u00a0which currently manages about $5 billion (US$3.9 billion) in ETFs and mutual funds, to $25 billion to $30 billion in five or six years.

RioCan is planning to sell about 100 of its 289 properties altogether.\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable that we\u2019re going to hit our numbers,\u201d Sonshine, 71, said.A major migration to metropolitan areas is underway globally, Sonshine said. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to start focusing our assets because that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to get rent growth, more demand for space and that will be where you get population growth.\u201dPart of the revenue used from RioCan\u2019s sales will go toward the development of as many as 10,000 residential units in Canada\u2019s major markets, called \u201cRioCan Living.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s less demand for retail space but there\u2019s a lot of demand for great residential apartments,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cSo I said, well, let\u2019s just rip down all, or part of, our shopping centres and replace it with medium-rise or, depending on location, even high-rise apartments and then just put new retail on the ground floors of those buildings because there still is retail demand, it\u2019s just very different.\u201dSonshine points to a 36-story building across from his office window in midtown Toronto as the best example of his vision: a new rental building located near the subway, a large shopping mall, offices and restaurants. RioCan has five buildings under construction in Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto so far, and is aiming to have at least three more by the end of 2018.New RioCan rentals will include \u2018tech packages\u2019 with automated concierges, lockers and cold-storage to appeal to the new trend of online grocery shopping, while common areas could include study or co-working spaces as previous amenities such as gyms, party rooms and swimming pools fall out of favour.Rising interest rates may soon counter profits from building rental housing, developers said. REITs, seen as income-producing investments, have come under pressure in general as the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times over the past past 12 months. RioCan units have lost 12 per cent over that time.\u201cThe window as far as viability in terms of the business side of rental development is closing,\u201d Jason Turcotte, vice president of development at Cressey Development Group, said in a phone interview, adding that at least half of the Vancouver-based company\u2019s portfolio is rental. \u201cRental development is super, super sensitive to interest rates.\u201dSonshine agreed rising rates could be a major barrier to creating affordable rental housing in markets like Toronto or Vancouver.\u201cI\u2019m a prisoner of the municipalities and it can take a year to get a building permit and that\u2019s after you spend two years getting zoning \u2014 it\u2019s a lengthy regulatory process, it\u2019s not an easy game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big advantage to us is owning the land already and having some income coming in from it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely and Kevin Orland", "title": "'I'm not crazy about Canada': Investors bail on trapped oil as pipeline problems worsen", "description": "With pipeline, regulatory and political frustrations reaching new heights, energy stocks have slumped to their lowest level in almost two years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/investors-bail-on-landlocked-canada-oil-as-pipeline-woes-deepen", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0222pumpjacks.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 22, 2018 10:08 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s energy companies can\u2019t get any love, even from many Canadians.With pipeline, regulatory and political frustrations reaching new heights, energy stocks slumped to their lowest level in almost two years this month. The iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF, which tracks Canadian energy companies, has seen about US$56 million in outflows this year versus US$32 million in inflows for an ETF focused on U.S. stocks. The pain has extended to the fixed-income market, with U.S. dollar high-yield bonds from Canadian energy issuers returning less than their global peers in the past 12 months.At the heart of the sector\u2019s woes is a dearth of pipeline capacity, which has depressed Canadian oil and natural gas prices. A new regulatory regime designed to speed up pipeline approvals is instead seen delaying projects while Alberta and British Columbia are fighting over one of the conduits the federal government has approved. On top of that, the industry is facing carbon taxes other jurisdictions don\u2019t have to pay and it\u2019s competing with American drillers which are seeing taxes cut under the Trump Administration.\u201cI\u2019m not crazy about Canada,\u201d Paul Tepsich, founder and portfolio manager at hedge fund High Rock Capital Management Inc. in Toronto, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019ve got taxes going up and regulations going up.\u201dTepsich said he reduced the average exposure to Canadian energy equities in his clients\u2019 to well under 3 per cent from 8 per cent a year ago. And while credit exposure remains relatively steady, he has no plans to add new holdings. He\u2019s been adding to short-dated U.S. Treasuries amid market volatility and will look to selectively add U.S. energy names.The big albatross for Canadian energy companies has been weak prices, caused by the pipeline pinch. Western Canadian Select, the main grade of oil extracted by Canadian oilsands producers, is trading near the widest discount to West Texas Intermediate crude in almost four years. Alberta Energy Co. natural gas prices are also lagging their U.S. equivalent. WCS discounts would cost the Canadian economy about $15.6 billion a year, or 0.75 per cent of GDP, if maintained at current levels, Scotiabank Chief Economist Jean-Francois Perrault said in a note.The pipeline frustrations recently erupted into a trade war between oil-producing Alberta and neighbouring British Columbia after the coastal province proposed limiting new shipments of oilsands crude through its borders, possibly stalling a major expansion of the Kinder Morgan Inc. oil pipeline. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley banned imports of B.C. wine and abandoned talks to possibly buy more electricity from its neighbor.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government also announced earlier this month a plan to revamp the national energy regulator with a goal of giving the industry a speedier, more efficient approval process. But the plan also may include adding new types of projects that require federal approval and allows more input for some stakeholder groups, sparking industry fears it won\u2019t become any easier.The proposed legislation appears to effectively prevent any major new project from reaching any form of positive recommendation, the research team at GMP FirstEnergy, a major investment bank to the energy sector, said in a note. \u201cA lack of hard timelines and a regulatory process that has been subject to dithering and near endless legal challenges will become the major stumbling block for domestic and international investor confidence in the Canadian energy sector.\u201dFederal Resources Minister Jim Carr said earlier this month the Liberal government has balanced government support for the energy industry with protecting the environment and receiving input from Canadians, noting $500 billion in projects are planned over the next decade.Banker and bondholder willingness to refinance debt and give companies time to boost output helped keep many struggling producers out of bankruptcy as oil prices slumped in recent years. Investor flight means it will be tougher for Canadian energy companies to access financing for capital-intensive projects. Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s US$14 billion Fort Hills project, approved when WTI was US$100 a barrel but started production last month, may be the last of a generation of mega Canadian oilsands projects.\u201cI\u2019m inclined to believe that we don\u2019t see another oilsands project built,\u201d Geof Marshall, the guardian of US$40 billion of assets at CI Investments\u2019 Signature Global Asset Management in Toronto, said by phone. The majority of his energy holdings are concentrated in U.S. regions like the Permian Basin, where there\u2019s more capacity to move the commodity, he said.Rafi Tahmazian, who helps manage about $1 billion in energy investments at Canoe Financial in Calgary, said he began trimming holdings of Canadian energy equities after Justin Trudeau was elected in 2015. He started shifting further into the U.S. after Donald Trump became president and vowed to trim regulations and environmental protection.Canada needs to cut taxes and ensure pipelines and LNG terminals get built, Tahmazian said.\u00a0\u201cMy job as an investor is to gauge and make investments based on my confidence in a leader of a company and a country, or a province or a state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I have zero confidence there right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "With Keystone XL still in limbo, TransCanada moves ahead with $2.4-billion natural gas expansion", "description": "TransCanada will spend $2.4 billion to expand its NGTL System in Alberta, adding 1 billion cubic feet of daily shipping capacity", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/keystone-xl-on-hold-transcanada-turns-to-natural-gas-system", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0215transcanada.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 15, 2018 1:50 PM EST", "content": "While TransCanada Corp. continues to weigh whether to build its long-delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline, the company announced another major expansion of its natural gas system in Alberta.TransCanada will spend $2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion) to expand its NGTL System, adding 1 billion cubic feet of daily shipping capacity, according to a statement Thursday. The company struck binding agreements with shippers that start in November 2020 and April 2021, with an average contract term of almost 29 years.The expansion shows TransCanada isn\u2019t sitting still while it considers whether to move ahead with Keystone XL. The company has been proceeding with preliminary work on the US$8 billion, 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometre) project, but hasn\u2019t officially announced a decision to build it. Activists haven\u2019t given up trying to block it, with opposition groups filing a motion to invalidate a key permit last week. TransCanada made no significant new announcements about Keystone XL in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday.Even without Keystone XL, the company\u2019s oil transport business posted strong results. The unit\u2019s comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 33 per cent to $401 million, helped by higher volumes on the existing Keystone system and the start of operations on its Grand Rapids and Northern Courier lines.For the company as a whole, profit excluding some items was 82 US cents a share, the company said in a separate statement. Analysts estimated 75 US cents, on average. TransCanada boosted its quarterly dividend 10 per cent to 69 US cents a share.The shares rose 4.4 per cent to $55.98 at 10:33 a.m. in Toronto. TransCanada has slid 8.2 per cent this year, compared with a 13 per cent drop for the S&P/TSX energy index.The expansion on the NGTL system may bring some relief to Canadian natural gas drillers who have suffered through wild swings in pricing as rising production from the prolific Montney formation tries to move through a crowded pipeline network. Maintenance on the system last summer sent AECO gas\u2019s discount to Henry Hub to the widest in more than a decade.The project unveiled on Thursday follows a $2-billion expansion that TransCanada announced in June.

That meant the firm missed out on the best of the global rally but put it in a good position to go overweight again.\u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. We think there\u2019s more downside to be had before we get long again,\u201d Bourdon said in a phone interview.The S&P 500 Index tumbled 10 per cent from its high on Jan. 26 to Feb. 8 before rebounding to near levels seen at the beginning of the year. But Bourdon said it will take more than a 10 per cent correction to make U.S. stocks look attractive again, and he\u2019s waiting until the benchmark falls to between 2,400 and 2,500 to start buying \u2014 about eight per cent below current levels.Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index, meanwhile, didn\u2019t quite hit official correction territory this month but has fared much worse than the U.S. in the longer run. While the S&P 500 is up about 20 per cent since the beginning of 2017, the S&P/TSX has gained just 0.3 per cent, making it among the worst-performing developed markets.As a result, Bourdon said he\u2019s seeing the most attractive opportunities in Canada, which is \u201cgetting crushed.\u201dHe believes oil prices still have some upside, especially after the 10 per cent decline that closely tracked the rout in stocks. More importantly, Canada\u2019s resource-heavy benchmark tends to perform well late in the cycle, which is where Bourdon thinks we are.\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re in the seventh or eighth inning and we want to be there for the full game,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally seventh or eight inning is the stretch when late cyclicals do better.\u201dEnergy and materials stocks, which together make up about 30 per cent of the Canadian benchmark, tend to outperform late in the cycle. Bourdon recommends an overweight position on Canada as well as emerging markets, where the fundamentals look strong, and an underweight position on the U.S. and the EAFE region (Europe, Australasia and the Far East).Bourdon is generally upbeat on the prospects for 2018, and sees a strong global economy, improving corporate profits and a \u201cdecent year\u201d for equities. But rates will also continue to march higher, causing more volatility in a market that got lulled by months of unusual calm, and he cautions investors not to panic.\u201cWhen things are moving at 100 miles an hour you need to have your mind running slower,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we try to dominate the volatility.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "'I can't get excited': Stocks still too pricey for this top-performing Canadian hedge fund", "description": "David McLean, managing director at Toronto-based McLean Asset Management, is particularly unenthused about Canadian stocks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-still-too-pricey-for-top-performing-canadian-hedge-fund", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0213traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 13, 2018 11:12 AM EST", "content": "One of Canada\u2019s best-performing hedge funds says stocks are still expensive after last week\u2019s correction and he sees little to get excited about.\u201cRight now we\u2019re still nowhere close to an equalization in interest rates with equity markets,\u201d said David McLean, managing director at Toronto-based McLean Asset Management Ltd.

A booming tech and financial sector helped send unemployment in the city to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as it remained a magnet for immigrants. Meanwhile, companies such as LaSalle Investment Management Inc. have launched funds focusing on Canadian commercial property as foreign investors seek a haven with open borders and stable finances.Among high-profile transactions was Alberta Investment Management Corp.\u2019s purchase along with KingSett Capital Inc. of the remaining 50 per cent stake in Scotia Plaza for $682 million. Also Leadon Investment Inc. bought the 567-room Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto for $216 million as part of their larger $1.1 billion portfolio acquisition of properties across Canada from British Columbia Investment Management Corp.Land sales took up the bulk of the annual increase in investment volumes rising 49 per cent to $8.5 billion, Altus said. Residential-land sales should remain strong this year, although high prices and policy changes have introduced more uncertainty to the market, Altus said.

Companies that may have specialized in shopping-mall development are now considering multi-use space that includes apartments, offices and rentals, he said.\u201cThe real estate landscape has changed to one where inventory management, understanding demographics, thinking about the use of property and about different rental scenarios is now a much more sophisticated game,\u201d he said.That\u2019s a bonus for Altus, which provides global data on commercial real estate and consulting options for everything from property tax to investment feasibility. \u201cWe bring a lot of expertise to those large complex type of opportunities.

The London, Ontario-based bank plans to have its digital vault ready by June and offer the service to global customers.\u201cWe\u2019re using what banks are all about \u2014 safety and security \u2014 only what we\u2019re doing now is saying that physical box in the basement is getting obsolete,\u201d David Taylor, chief executive officer of Canada\u2019s smallest bank by assets, said in interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cMost people\u2019s really valuable assets are contained in some sort of digital format, whether it be a deed or a contract or a cryptocurrency.\u201dThe move underscores a paradox of Canada\u2019s financial system, which is dominated by six large lenders. While its banks are regularly regarded as among the world\u2019s soundest, it\u2019s also home to a boisterous junior stock market where new trends from blockchain to marijuana can quickly captivate investors.VersaBank hired cybersecurity expert Gurpreet Sahota from BlackBerry Ltd. \u2014 the former smartphone maker long viewed as a world leader in security and encryption \u2014 to lead software engineers in designing its \u201cVersaVault.\u201d It\u2019ll securely store digital assets on computer servers around the world. Like a safety deposit box, the bank won\u2019t know what\u2019s inside.

Hackers typically steal money from crypto exchanges by gaining access to their internet-connected wallet that stores customer funds.Large funds are showing interest in storing their assets in VersaVault since the company announced the plan last month, Taylor said. Pricing hasn\u2019t been set, though it\u2019ll be expensive, he said.VersaBank is building its vault as Bitcoin plunged below US$7,000 on Monday for the first time since November, pulling down other digital tokens, as several U.S. banks said they\u2019re halting cryptocurrency purchases on credit cards, with some citing risk aversion and a desire to protect customers.VersaBank is an early mover among traditional banks. South Korea\u2019s Shinhan Bank said in November it planned to start a bitcoin vault by mid year. Outside banking, Palo Alto, California-based Xapo Inc. has offered clients secure storage for Bitcoin for about four years, while Goldmoney Inc., a Toronto-based firm that lets clients buy, sell and store precious metals in vaults in seven countries, started offering Bitcoin\u00a0storage in September.The bank wouldn't have any kind of back door to open up the vault, we're just providing the facility that folks could put their digital keys inTaylor is no stranger to innovation. He introduced a branchless bank to Canada in 1993, four years before ING Groep NV arrived in the country to offer telephone banking as ING Direct. VersaBank, which has its roots as a trust in Saskatchewan in 1979, still operates on a branchless electronic model, gathering deposits through a nationwide network of brokers and buying loan and lease receivables from non-bank financial firms while working with partners to offer behind-the-scenes financing for retail and small businesses.\u201cWe\u2019re a digital bank that has very little human interface and serves as a warehouse for assets and liabilities, and makes a good spread in the middle,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s banking in its essence.\u201dTaylor is an avid pilot and collects motorcycles \u2014 his 1969 Triumph Bonneville is his favourite. He lives 190 kilometres (120 miles) west of Toronto \u2014 Canada\u2019s financial capital \u2014 in London. His 100-acre farm has a 2,000-foot landing strip used for his three prop planes, including a Cessna 337 he retrofitted with a Corvette car engine and called Skyvette. He often flies into Toronto for meetings.Taylor\u2019s banking career began in 1977, when he applied for a job at Bank of Montreal \u201cas a lark\u201d because he couldn\u2019t find summer work in biology after getting his undergraduate science degree. He previously held a part-time job as a prison guard.VersaBank, with a market value of about $158 million (US$126 million), 80 employees and $1.73 billion in assets, has outperformed Canada\u2019s big banks, with shares soaring 24 per cent this year versus the 2.9 per cent decline of the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index. Last year VersaBank rose 19 per cent compared to the 11 per cent gain of the banks index. Taylor is now eyeing a bit more growth while staying the course.\u201cI\u2019m happy to be a niche player, but can probably double the size we are in assets,\u201d he said. \u201cI think $3 billion is kind of a nice number.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "If you think the U.S. stock sell-off was painful, just look at the rot in the TSX", "description": "Every major sector in the TSX has done worse than its U.S. counterpart this year, suggesting it's not just unlucky index composition that's plaguing the market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/if-you-think-the-u-s-stock-sell-off-was-painful-look-north", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0205stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 5, 2018 10:57 AM EST", "content": "The rot in the Canadian stock market is as wide as it is deep.Every major sector in the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index has done worse than its U.S. counterpart this year, suggesting it\u2019s not just unlucky index composition that\u2019s plaguing the market, the usual scapegoat whenever Canadian stocks are lagging.The TSX is down 3.7 per cent this year, versus a 3.3 per cent gain in the S&P 500, after the worst January for the Canadian index since 2010. Less than one-fifth of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 Index \u2014 the lowest number in two decades.\u201cThe easy answer is to look at the composition and say, well, the TSX doesn\u2019t have what\u2019s working and therefore we\u2019re going to underperform,\u201d said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cBut when you go below the surface, there\u2019s something more going on than just composition.\u201dComposition is certainly playing a part. The S&P/TSX\u00a0is heavily weighted toward financials, energy and materials, which together make up more than two-thirds of the benchmark. Energy in particular has been a chronic underperformer, as the gap between Canadian and U.S. crude prices is the widest since 2013.At the same time, the S&P/TSX is light on technology and health-care stocks, which have been huge drivers of the U.S. rally. Together, those sectors make up just 4.5 per cent of the Canadian market compared with 38 per cent of the S&P 500.\u201cThe composition component is one that\u2019s chronic for the domestic market, but is really showing its stripes in this environment,\u201d said Craig Fehr, Canadian investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co.The obvious culprit is U.S. tax reform, which has led to upward earnings revisions across most sectors and a broad repricing of shares south of the border, while having little to no impact in Canada.But the divergence goes beyond that. While the U.S. was cutting tax rates, three of Canada\u2019s biggest provinces hiked their minimum wage. While the U.S. dollar fell 3.4 per cent against major world currencies in January, making exports more competitive, the loonie rose to its highest level since September. And while Canada\u2019s economy was the hottest of the Group of Seven last year, it\u2019s expected to decelerate this year as U.S. growth picks up.\u00a0Add to this worries about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, high Canadian consumer debt levels and tighter mortgage-lending rules and it\u2019s not surprising that Canadian stocks can\u2019t keep up.Strategists expect Canada to close the performance gap eventually, but it won\u2019t be because stocks suddenly start to soar.\u201cRealistically you\u2019ll probably see equity markets in the U.S. settle down rather than Canada all of a sudden starting to run at a 20 per cent year-over-year pace and catching up,\u201d Kavcic said.That may have started on Friday when U.S. stocks plunged 2.1 per cent amid worries about rising interest rates, and Canadian stocks fell 1.6 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeremy Herron", "title": "Dow plunges to close down 666 points in worst drop since June 2016", "description": "There was nowhere to hide on the stock market, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors lower; TSX takes it on the chin, too, falling 4% this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/dow-sheds-400-points-heading-for-worst-week-in-two-years", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/0202traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 2, 2018 7:22 PM EST", "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 666 points in the biggest plunge since June 2016, as the worsening bond rout stirred angst that the Federal Reserve will accelerate its rate-hike schedule.Solid jobs data that underscored the strength of the economy sent bond bulls scurrying and rattled equity investors who haven\u2019t seen a week this bad in two years. The tandem selling accelerated after Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan suggested officials may need to hike more than three times this year to cool the advance. The 10-year Treasury yield popped above 2.85 per cent for the first time since January 2014.\u201cYields have risen, inflation evidence is rising rather broadly. It\u2019s that combo of factors that\u2019s starting to mount,\u201d Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden, said by phone. \u201cAnd then you get a report, and that\u2019s the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, and that\u2019s kind of what we got into today.\u201dThere was nowhere to hide on the stock market, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors lower. The index\u2019s five-day rout reached 3.9 per cent \u2014 marking its first pullback of at least that much in a record 404 days. Energy shares sank 4.1 per cent as earnings disappointed and crude slumped. The tech selloff worsened, sending the Nasdaq 100 index lower by 2.1 per cent. Its weekly rout hit 3.7 per cent, most since February 2006. Not even a record rally at Amazon.com Inc. could rescue the measure, as the world\u2019s biggest company, Apple Inc. hit its lowest since October.\u201cPeople are finally starting to reprice reflation; it\u2019s about time,\u201d Jeanne Asseraf-Bitton, head of global cross-asset research at Lyxor Asset Management, said by phone. \u201cGlobal economic growth is strong and corporate earnings are very solid, so there\u2019s no reason to question the equity bull market. The rise in bond yields is good, it\u2019s just the speed at which it\u2019s happening that is making investors nervous. Bottom line: this is a healthy correction.\u201dU.S. hiring picked up in January and wages rose at the fastest annual pace since the recession ended, as the economy\u2019s steady move toward full employment extended into 2018. Equities are being tested by the surge in bond yields, with some fund managers saying three per cent U.S. 10-year rates would signal a bond bear market. The level is seen by many stock watchers as a potential trigger for a correction in equities.In Europe, a bond selloff deepened across the continent, and equities dropped for a fifth straight day, the longest streak since November. Disappointing results from companies including Deutsche Bank AG and BT Group Plc. paced losses, with Germany\u2019s DAX giving up the year\u2019s gains, capping the worst weekly decline since 2016. Bund yields reached a fresh two-year high, while the euro and British pound weakened. Japanese debt gained and the yen declined after the Bank of Japan intervened to stem the rise in rates.Canada\u2019s main stock index also took it on the chin, sliding more than 250 points, down 4 per cent over the past week, in a broad-based decline that included drops in every sector. The S&P/TSX composite index fell 254.89 points to 15,606.03.The last such drop on the TSX was more than seven months ago when it lost about 269 points on May 17, 2017. While all sectors finished Friday in the red, shares in health care saw the steepest losses of an average 6.18 per cent.Cannabis stocks led the decline in the sector, with Canopy Growth Corp. dropping $3.44 or 12.49 per cent to $24.11, while Aphria Inc. shares fell $1.60 or 10.34 per cent to $13.88.

That\u2019s less than half Chevron Corp.\u2019s valuation.Among Canadian producers, what makes Calgary-based Husky appealing is that its significant refining capacity insulates it against the price discounts weighing on Canadian heavy crude, while its growing natural gas sales under contract make it immune to fluctuations at Alberta\u2019s AECO hub, said Chris Cox, an analyst at Raymond James. It\u2019s particularly attractive for fund managers who already have positions in Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\u201cAs the market is starting to get a little more constructive on oil prices, there\u2019s been this growing question of, \u2018OK, where next after Suncor?\u2019\u201d Cox said. \u201cWhen you consider all the various moving parts of the macro perspective \u2014 the concerns over heavy oil prices, concerns over AECO gas and this constructive outlook for refining \u2014 you could almost do a process of elimination and Husky really quickly came to the top of that list.\u201d\u2018Much of Husky\u2019s 9 per cent advance came in the final weeks of last year as oil prices surged past US$60 a barrel in New York and the company projected in early December that it would generate free cash flow of $1 billion (US$800 million) in 2018. The gains compare with a 10 per cent loss for the S&P/TSX energy index in 2017. Suncor and Canadian Natural both rose about 5 per cent. Husky rose 1.5 per cent to $18.94 at 11:59 a.m. in Toronto.Yet Husky still has a ways to go in regaining analysts\u2019 favour. Even after four upgrades last month, only 27 per cent of the analysts covering the company recommend buying the shares. That compares with 86 per cent for Canadian Natural and 63 per cent for Suncor.Still weighing on the stock is that it isn\u2019t as much of a pure play on the Canadian oilsands as its rivals, and some of its refining operations are less profitable than peers. Also, almost 70 per cent of the shares are owned by Li, and companies where investors are getting a minority interest tend to garner lower valuations, Cox said.Another factor that may lure portfolio managers back to Husky is the potential reinstatement of its dividend, which the company cancelled as oil prices sank in late 2015. Husky executives said last month that the board is likely to bring back a dividend this year because it has repaired its balance sheet and is generating free cash flow, and oil prices have rebounded.\u201cThey had to spend the downturn resetting some growth expectations, resetting the balance sheet, resetting the funding levels, and once they\u2019ve gotten those ducks in a row, especially with where crack spreads are and refining margins are, now they\u2019re at a point where they\u2019re going to be looking pretty decent,\u201d Cox said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "New junior marijuana ETF offers investors rare exposure to U.S. businesses", "description": "The U.S. recreational marijuana market has been largely avoided by other ETFs because of legal uncertainties", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/etfs/new-junior-marijuana-etf-offers-investors-rare-exposure-to-u-s-businesses", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0112marijuana.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 12, 2018 10:48 AM EST", "content": "A Canadian firm is launching an exchange-traded fund that gives investors exposure to the U.S. recreational marijuana market \u2014 a sector that\u2019s been largely avoided by other ETFs because of legal uncertainties.Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. has filed a preliminary prospectus to launch the Junior Marijuana Growers Index ETF, which includes companies with operations in the U.S. This is in contrast to Horizons\u2019s existing Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, which avoids U.S. growers and focuses on larger companies with ancillary exposure like Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.The new ETF will be listed on Canada\u2019s Aequitas NEO Exchange instead of the Toronto Stock Exchange, where Horizons\u2019s other marijuana ETF trades. That\u2019s because the TSX has said it may delist marijuana stocks which run afoul of U.S. federal law.\u00a0While pot is legal in several U.S. states including California and Colorado, it\u2019s illegal federally. Canada plans to legalize it across the country this summer. This discrepancy has created a valuation gap between pot stocks with Canadian operations and those with U.S. businesses, and prompted more companies with U.S. assets to list north of the border on exchanges like NEO and the Canadian Securities Exchange.Companies with U.S. operations that could benefit from inclusion in the new ETF include CannaRoyalty Corp., iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc., MPX Bioceutical Corp., Marapharm Ventures Inc., Friday Night Inc. and Sunniva Inc., according to Beacon Securities analyst Vahan Ajamian.\u201cThe next month would be a good time to start acquiring shares of U.S. operators and smaller Canadian cannabis companies,\u201d Ajamian wrote in a note published Thursday. \u201cShould it go forward as planned, share prices and liquidity of U.S. operators could be disproportionately impacted by the new buying power of an ETF.\u201dThe two existing marijuana exchange-traded funds \u2014 Horizons\u2019s and the U.S.-traded ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF \u2014 have captivated investors.

And he\u2019s taking advantage of a shortcut onto the Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s junior bourse to go public.Novogratz\u2019s plan is to acquire Vancouver-based First Coin Capital Corp. and then list the combined company through a reverse takeover of an inactive firm called Bradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc. Bradmer is currently listed on the NEX, a board for companies that fall below the TSX Venture Exchange\u2019s listing standards. If the deal goes through, it will change its name to Galaxy Digital Holdings and resume a listing on the Venture exchange.It may sound bizarre for a high-profile fund manager to list a new merchant bank via a tiny Canadian pharmaceutical company, but the strategy is widely used in the cryptocurrency space and other emerging sectors like pot. The TSX Venture Exchange has hundreds of \u201czombie\u201d shells that can provide access to listings via reverse takeovers.RTOs, as they\u2019re known, don\u2019t require a full securities commission review or the weighty prospectuses that are the hallmark of initial public offerings. Usually faster and cheaper than an IPO, RTOs have been used 265 times on the TSX Venture since 2001. By comparison, there were just 49 over the same period on the Nasdaq.Canada\u2019s widespread use of RTOs makes it an outlier, even as the bourse hails it as a way to develop small companies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules in 2011 that made it harder for private companies to use them, and the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services Authority took steps in 2012 to close loopholes that had allowed some ineligible companies to list that way.The strategy is often used by new companies in the cryptocurrency sector. Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. listed via a reverse takeover of Leeta Gold Corp. and soared 220 per cent on its first day of trading in September. Before the listing, millions of Leeta shares traded hands without a disclosed price, as required by securities rules. Hive says it was a private transaction involving a predecessor company, and that it meets all disclosure requirements.Hut 8 Mining Corp., another Vancouver-based Bitcoin company, plans to debut on the TSX Venture Exchange this month via a shell listing.Other sources of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related listings outside Canada have been even more bizarre. Long Island Iced Tea Corp. surged as much as 298 per cent after announcing a name change to Long Blockchain Corp., and Crypto Co. is the product of a reverse merger with a company that made water and radio-wave resistant sports bra pockets.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "'We will outperform': Canada's top preferred fund seeks value in turbo-charged market", "description": "The odds of a rate hike have more than doubled, but Canada's best-performing preferred share fund isn't rushing to adjust its strategy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/top-canada-preferred-fund-seeks-value-in-turbo-charged-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/01069boc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2018 10:01 AM EST", "content": "The odds of a rate hike at the next Bank of Canada meeting more than doubled after a blockbuster December jobs report, but Canada\u2019s best-performing preferred share fund isn\u2019t rushing to adjust its strategy.\u201cWe put less of a focus on interest-rate anticipation and more of a focus on selecting undervalued securities,\u201d said Ryan Domsy, manager of the $167 million (US$134 million) preferred share fund at Foyston, Gordon & Payne Inc., a Toronto-based investment manager with $13.3 billion under management. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re floaters, perpetuals or rate resets \u2014 if we\u2019re constantly buying what\u2019s undervalued, we will outperform.\u201dPreferred shares have had a great run as Canada\u2019s economy picked up steam in 2017, culminating in a plunge in the unemployment rate to 5.7 per cent in December \u2014 the lowest in more than 40 years. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates twice and investors expect it do so so at the next announcement on Jan. 17, holding out the prospect of fatter dividends as rates on preferred shares tied to government bond yields reset higher.The FGP Preferred Share Fund, which is also the sub-adviser for the Evolve Active Canadian Preferred Share ETF, returned 22 per cent in 2017. This makes it the best-performing preference fund in Canada, including mutual funds and ETFs. By comparison, the S&P/TSX Preferred Total Return Index gained 14 per cent last year.But Domsy said there are other factors besides interest rates that should go into investing decisions, including business risk, financial risk and structural risk. He believes this approach gives him an edge over other managers, who tend to measure value using more simplistic metrics like yield-to-reset or yield-to-call ratios.\u201cWhen you look at the financials, for example, people paint all banks with almost one brush, which is fairly ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s huge differences between the risk levels of a TD Bank and a National Bank, and when you look at the fixed-income securities that they issue, it\u2019s very rarely ever reflected in the pricing or the return characteristics.\u201dThe fund\u2019s small size gives it an advantage, Domsy said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a US$3 billion fund you literally have to hold everything, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201dBy contrast, FGP\u2019s fund can be \u201ca lot more nimble than some of the big managers that have to buy every new issue that comes to market,\u201d said Raj Lala, chief executive officer of Evolve Funds Group Inc., whose pref ETF mirrors the FGP fund.\u201cThe nice thing is right now preferreds have actually for the most part lagged the recent changes in interest rates,\u201d Domsy said. \u201cSo even if the interest rate increases aren\u2019t as aggressive as some people are expecting, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a problem with preferreds.

Leisure use began in California this week, and Blair said other jurisdictions have seen prices fall as their markets develop.\u201cI think there are, almost inevitably, economies of scale that will be realized both in production and in the distribution,\u201d Blair said. \u201cOver time, prices do come down.\u201dIn a follow-up written statement, Blair said the price of pot will be determined both by the market and by provincial regulators. \u201cThe provinces may use both price and tax levers to maintain a price that is both competitive with the illicit market and not so low as to create an incentive for increased use,\u201d he said.The Canadian government projects an annual market of about $4 billion (US$3.2 billion) for legalized marijuana.\u00a0The country\u2019s finance ministers have agreed on a marijuana excise tax of 10 per cent of the product price, or $1 per gram, whichever is higher. Sales taxes, ranging from 5 per cent to 15 per cent across provinces, will also be applied. The federal government has agreed to hand over at least 75 per cent of excise tax revenue to provinces for the first two years after legalization.Nick Dean, chief executive officer of licensed medical producer Emblem Corp., said he expects the marijuana industry will be able to compete with the black market.\u201cThe strategy right now is we would be selling at a competitive price and that\u2019s been supported by the government,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best way to displace the black market is through education and brand, and people are willing to pay a premium for a brand experience.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Canadian stocks destined for another lacklustre year with only meagre gains expected in 2018", "description": "Canada's equity benchmark will rise about 4.4 per cent in 2018, a return that would lag last year's 6 per cent gain that trailed most global indexes, strategists say", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stocks-set-for-meager-gains-in-2018-strategists-say", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0102tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 2, 2018 8:54 AM EST", "content": "Investors counting on a rebound in Canadian stocks following a lacklustre 2017 are likely to be disappointed.Canada\u2019s equity benchmark will rise about 4.4 per cent in 2018, a return that would lag last year\u2019s 6 per cent gain that trailed most global indexes, strategists say.The S&P/TSX Composite Index will end the year at 16,928, compared with 2017\u2019s closing mark of 16,209, according to the average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This compares with an average year-end forecast of 2,875 for the S&P 500 Index in the U.S, a projected gain of 7.5 per cent.\u201cA lot of people who are bullish are looking at valuations and thinking Canada\u2019s got to play catch-up,\u201d said Sadiq Adatia, who oversees about $20 billion (US$15.6 billion) as the chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into that story.\u201dSun Life has the most bearish forecast, calling for the benchmark to end the year at 15,200, a decline of 6.2 per cent.Adatia sees four key risks facing Canadian stocks this year: high consumer debt levels, falling home prices, a potential slowdown in wage and job growth and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He believes consumer discretionary stocks are most at risk, while utilities and telecoms will be the safest investments.Unlike other forecasters, Adatia isn\u2019t bullish on the outlook for the energy patch, which he believes won\u2019t start to rebound until West Texas Intermediate prices rise above US$60. Adatia\u2019s forecast calls for crude prices as low as US$50 in 2018, from about US$60 now.Luc Vallee, chief strategist at Laurentian Bank Securities, begs to differ. Vallee sees the Canadian benchmark hitting 18,000 by the end of the year, a target that makes him the most bullish forecaster with an implied return of 11 percent. Vallee was about 300 points off on his 2017 year-end forecast of 16,500.Vallee believes WTI prices will rise to the high US$60s in 2018, allowing Canadian energy companies to \u201ccry for joy,\u201d he said. On top of that, he sees an end to the glut that held down Canadian crude prices this year as pipeline building revs up.\u201cGiven the weight of the energy sector in the TSX, it\u2019s going to explode,\u201d he said. The energy index accounts for about 20 per cent of the benchmark.Craig Fehr, Canadian investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co., is in the middle of the pack with a forecast of 17,050. He sees energy stocks getting a lift from a rebound in the oil patch, while consumer discretionary and financials will face headwinds.\u201cThat\u2019s based on my view that I think economic growth is going to slow quite materially in 2018,\u201d Fehr said. He sees 1.5 per cent GDP growth this year, about half of what\u2019s expected for 2017.Some of the forecasts for 2017 were spot on; others not so much.\u00a0Among forecasts compiled by Bloomberg in March, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc.\u2019s Martin Roberge and RBC Capital Markets\u2019 Matt Barasch were tied for the closest estimate at 16,300, less than 100 points from the year\u2019s closing price. The most bullish forecast was from Fiera Capital Corp.\u2019s Candice Bangsund, who saw the TSX closing out the year at 16,575, while the most bearish was 15,150 from Manulife Asset Management\u2019s Philip Petursson.Here are the strategists\u2019 calls for 2018, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,200RBC Capital Markets: 16,300Russell Investments: 16,900Fiera Capital: 16,900Manulife: 17,000Edward Jones: 17,050Scotia Capital: 17,400BMO Capital Markets: 17,600Laurentian Bank: 18,000\u2013With assistance from Julie RombomBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson, Kristine Owram and Danielle Bochove", "title": "Bitcoin, pot stock crazes take root in Canada's wild west", "description": "How did safe, boring Canada become the financial home to pot growers and Bitcoin miners?", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/bitcoin-marijuana-stock-crazes-take-root-in-canadas-wild-west?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/baystreet.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 22, 2017 2:24 PM EST", "content": "When Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. was looking to tap into the cryptocurrency fervour by going public, Canada\u2019s junior stock exchange was the obvious choice. The bar for listing was low. Retail investors, used to the rise and fall of penny stocks, were eager for the next hot thing. To help ensure a spectacular debut, Hive paid online promoters more than US$750,000 plus options to sing the stock\u2019s praises.\u201cOur top stock suggestion for the history books!\u201d gushed Daniel Ameduri, president of Future Money Trends LLC, which was paid to recommend Hive. \u201cQuarterly filings from Hive could end up being big events, much like when Apple discloses its quarterly iPhone sales.\u201dIt all worked like a charm. Vancouver-based Hive, a cryptocurrency miner backed by mining maverick Frank Giustra, more than tripled on its first day of trading and would soar as much as 2,157 per cent. It hit a market value of $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) last month, making it one of the largest blockchain-related companies anywhere.Canada, a bastion of financial stability with some of the world\u2019s soundest banks, has become a launchpad for the next big thing \u2014 from lithium stocks to 80 marijuana startups and now Bitcoin miners. The easy listing rules on the country\u2019s junior exchanges have sparked some early-stage winners like Hive and made quick millionaires as stocks soar.Yet they can also open the door to blatant stock promotion, murky disclosure and spectacular volatility.Liberty One Lithium Corp., a Vancouver-based penny stock tapping investor demand for the metal used in electric car batteries, soared 250 per cent in October thanks in part to paid promotion. The stock promotions by Liberty and others led to a tightening of rules by the OTC Markets Group, the U.S. exchange where Liberty One trades. Liberty One, which has dropped by almost two thirds since its October peak, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.In October, West High Yield (WHY) Resources Ltd., a tiny magnesium explorer in Calgary, surged almost 1,000 per cent in one day after it said it sold a mining asset for US$750 million, or 46 times the value of the company. The financing fell through and the stock plunged when a five-week trading halt was lifted, wiping out $194 million in shareholder value.\u201cThe long and short of it is there\u2019s a lot of scope for potential problems,\u201d says Douglas Cumming, a finance professor at Toronto\u2019s York University, who has studied Canada\u2019s exchanges. Rule of thumb, he says, the bar lowers with each hop from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq to the Toronto Stock Exchange. \u201cAnd then it really drops off going to the Toronto Venture Exchange.\u201dWhile Hive has been a hit with investors, the company\u2019s paid promotion, though legal, wasn\u2019t fully disclosed by the company and promoters.\u00a0And just days before Hive got started by taking over a listed shell company in June, millions of shares in the shell traded hands without a disclosed price, as required by securities rules. Hive says it was a private transaction involving a predecessor company, and that it meets all disclosure requirements.Two features make Canada optimal for overnight sensations and crashes: easy listing requirements and hundreds of \u201czombie\u201d shells that are already on the exchange providing market access via reverse takeovers and other backdoor shortcuts to listings.\u201cIt\u2019s not that our listing standards are lower, but they\u2019re tailored to those companies that are still in that venture stage and growing,\u201d said Brady Fletcher, who heads the Toronto Venture Exchange.The TSX Venture\u2019s mining and oil and gas companies don\u2019t need to show any net tangible assets, earnings or revenue. Other sectors including industrial, technology and life sciences companies have to show net tangible assets and a \u201creasonable likelihood of revenue within 24 months.\u201dMany fail, and over the years have spawned a graveyard of companies that do little more than pay their listing fees. The TSX\u00a0Venture has a separate board, called the NEX, where about 328 companies that have fallen below the venture\u2019s listing standards trade, making fertile pickings for RTOs.RTOs and other shortcuts to listings using shells don\u2019t require a full securities commission review. They dispense with the weighty prospectuses vetted by regulators and scoured by investors for potential pitfalls. Usually cheaper and faster than an initial public offering, RTOs have been used 265 times on the TSX Venture since 2001. By comparison, there were just 49 over the same period on the Nasdaq.Reverse takeovers are \u201carguably the most efficient way to test the capital markets,\u201d said Fletcher. \u201cIt allows entrepreneurs to see if there\u2019s investor appetite in them being a public company\u201d without all the upfront costs associated with an IPO.\u00a0Some of Canada\u2019s biggest companies have been built using the RTO, said Hive Chief Executive Officer Harry Pokrandt in an email. \u201cIt remains a useful method to quickly build and efficiently raise capital for major new companies, such as Hive.\u201dCanada\u2019s widespread use of RTOs makes it an outlier. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules in 2011 that made it harder for private companies to use them, and the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services Authority took steps in 2012 to close loopholes that had allowed some ineligible companies to list that way.This approach has allowed dozens of companies to tap into the hottest corporate plays. The combined market value of Canada\u2019s marijuana stocks has soared to $20 billion, while the 19-plus blockchain and bitcoin-related firms are worth about $3 billion. GMP Capital Inc., an investment bank, said it expects as many as 50 cryptocurrency listings in Canada next year.Hut 8 Mining Corp., another Vancouver-based Bitcoin company, plans to debut on the TSX Venture Exchange next month via a shell listing.\u201cThe benefit of a reverse takeover is that you can literally take a back door onto the exchange\u201d without dealing with regulators, Chief Executive Officer Sean Clark said in an interview.Hive\u2019s case, meanwhile, shows how quickly a company in Canada can leverage the latest stock craze. Hive listed about three months after\u00a0announcing that it had found its shell in Leeta Gold Corp.Vancouver-based Leeta announced a pact for financial advisory services with Giustra\u2019s Fiore Management & Advisory Corp. on June 6, followed days later by its reinvention as Hive.Prior to that, on June 2, two existing Leeta shareholders sold 29 million shares and 27 million warrants, while 34 million warrants were exercised. It\u2019s not clear what prices were paid by whom for the Leeta shares as they weren\u2019t disclosed. Canada\u2019s early warning disclosure rules require the sellers to say how much they were paid in such deals, as they represented more than half the outstanding stock, including warrants.\u201cThere are some gaping holes in disclosure,\u201d in the Leeta-Hive transaction,\u00a0said Rob Bruggeman, a former research analyst and principal of Alpha Advisory Services Inc., which consults for small miners.The Leeta shareholders\u2019 sales were private transactions, not Hive\u2019s, Pokrandt and Giustra said. As far as they are aware, \u201call proper insider filings have been made,\u201d they said in separate emails. Former Leeta CEO John Brydle couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The British Columbia Securities Commission said it doesn\u2019t comment on specific filings.The involvement of Giustra, a prominent figure in Canadian deal making, was enough to prompt excitement about Hive on stock boards. The company partnered with the builder of the world\u2019s largest miner of ether, owns crypto mining assets in Iceland and has raised more than $200 million, says Pokrandt.Hive\u2019s paid promotion may also have helped. Hive entered a three-year agreement starting Sept. 1 for \u201cmarketing services\u201d with Future Money Trends, paid for with 1.3 million stock options and $1 million in cash, according to filings and disclaimers.In the first week of trading, Hive shot up more than 500 per cent as nearly a dozen articles streamed onto three websites, exhorting readers to buy the stock.Paying for promotion isn\u2019t illegal in Canada or the U.S. as long as the payments are disclosed and the content is accurate. Hive\u2019s Pokrandt said the agreements with Future Money Trends were filed as required with the exchange. No breakout of the $1 million cash payments to Future Money Trends appear in its filings, only the stock options. Pokrandt said in an email that $500,000 was expensed in the September financial statement and $500,000 will appear in December.Cumming at York University says the light touch to listing and regulation come with a cost. The quality of companies that list on the TSX Venture through RTOs \u201cis really low on average,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIt begs the question, why do people ever invest in these Venture Exchange RTOs?\u201dHis answer: \u201cA preference for lottery tickets.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "\u2018I don't believe in Warren Buffett\u2019: Maverick manager makes 21% gains chasing market extremes", "description": "Fidelity\u2019s Mark Schmehl flouts Buffett, thinks valuation is overrated and says most other rules of investing are \u2018total baloney\u2019", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/fidelity-manager-rips-up-buffett-playbook-goes-all-in-on-crypto", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/fidelity.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 15, 2017 1:52 PM EST", "content": "Mark Schmehl flouts Warren Buffett, thinks valuation is overrated and says most other rules of investing are \u201ctotal baloney.\u201dThe portfolio manager, who just completed Fidelity Investments\u2019 most successful Canadian fund launch ever, eschews investing obsessions such as earnings, cash flow and price-earnings ratios and invests at the extremes of the market instead, including Canadian cryptocurrency stocks.It is all about finding industries where rapid change is occurring\u201cI focus on the stuff in the tails: really cheap, broken, horrible stories that nobody wants to buy again, and stocks that everybody is excited about but their valuation is so high they can\u2019t bring themselves to buy them,\u201d Schmehl, 46, said in an interview at Fidelity\u2019s Toronto offices.His approach seems to be working. Fidelity\u2019s $1.86 billion Special Situations Fund returned 21 per cent in the first 11 months of the year and its $3.73 billion Canadian Growth Company Fund returned 17 per cent. That compares with a total return of 7.8 per cent for the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index over the same time frame. His new Global Innovators Class, launched on Nov. 1, raised $400 million in four weeks in Fidelity\u2019s fastest launch north of the border.It\u2019s all about finding industries where rapid change is occurring. This can include beaten-down sectors that are suddenly showing glimmers of hope \u2014 Schmehl owns The New York Times Co. \u2014 or stocks that are permanently disrupting their industries, like PayPal Holdings Inc. and video-game company Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in Warren Buffett,\u201d he said. \u201cI care about new things, things that are innovative, that are growing, that are changing the world.\u201dHe\u2019s unfazed if those stocks look expensive. \u201cValuation is an immaterial part of the process for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the least useful piece of information you will ever get because everybody knows what the valuation is.\u201dIn the current long-in-the-tooth bull market, Schmehl is finding fewer of the horrible stocks and more of the expensive change-makers. He\u2019s been adding to positions in copper and energy stocks, but otherwise is mostly focused on disruptors.Among Canadian stocks, he\u2019s the largest investor in toymaker Spin Master Corp., and he also owns Shopify Inc., Canada Goose Holdings Inc., and \u201ceverything\u201d in the emerging cryptocurrency space. Stocks that have sprung up in the Canadian sector include Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. and NetCents Technology Inc.Schmehl also invests more than 3 per cent of his Canadian Growth and Special Situation funds\u2019 holdings into private Canadian companies, including DeepLearni.ng, a Toronto-based artificial intelligence company, and Thalmic Labs, a maker of wearable technology based in Waterloo, Ontario.He plans to hang onto those companies right to the end of the bull-market cycle, and maybe even beyond. \u201cI always tell people I will ride this thing right over the top. I will own the best stocks right to the end.\u201dThis may mean losing 20 per cent when the market turns, but that kind of double-digit loss doesn\u2019t frighten Schmehl. He\u2019ll be ready to pounce on the next wave. \u201cThat\u2019s when I get all the money back,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "Why the top Canadian oil stock since the crude crash is a small driller in Colombia", "description": "Investors have taken a liking to small producers who focus their operations in one region and aren't too adventurous with their capital spending", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/top-canadian-oil-stock-since-crash-is-small-colombia-driller", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/1208pumpjack.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 8, 2017 9:46 AM EST", "content": "Since crude prices sank below US$100 a barrel three years ago, investors in oil stocks have been sending one clear message to companies: Stick to your knitting.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Canada, where the benchmark index\u2019s top-performing, post-crash energy producer \u2014 Parex Resources Inc. \u2014 is a small company focused on extracting one commodity from one geographic region. Parex is one of only four stocks in the 50-company S&P/TSX energy index that have gained since July 30, 2014, the last day oil closed above US$100 a barrel.The gain by Parex shows how investors have taken a liking to small producers who focus their operations in one region and aren\u2019t too adventurous with their capital spending. While their diminutive size may seem like a disadvantage in a business dominated by behemoths, being small allows producers to provide investors with a clear picture of their plans and to wring out costs that larger operations can\u2019t avoid.\u201cThey\u2019re just more focused, more focused on costs,\u201d said Ken Lin, an analyst at Paradigm Capital in Calgary. \u201cIn a lower price environment, the lower cost operator is the better operator.\u201dParex, based in Calgary, produces oil in Colombia through both new wells and by reactivating old fields using enhanced-recovery techniques. The company also held assets in Trinidad & Tobago when it was split off from Petro Andina in 2009, but sold them to focus on its more promising Colombian operations. The shares have gained 11 per cent since oil slipped below US$100. The broader energy index has slumped 33 per cent.In a lower price environment, the lower cost operator is the better operatorDriving Parex\u2019s gain has been a debt-free balance sheet and an ability to increase its reserves and production entirely out of its cash flow, said Lin, who in a recent note nominated Parex as perhaps \u201cthe best oil and gas company in the universe.\u201dChief Executive Officer David Taylor said that the company will continue to focus on Colombia, rather than try to transport its expertise elsewhere.\u201cWe know how to do business here,\u201d Taylor said in an interview from Bogota, where he spends four to six weeks a year. \u201cWe have a very strong team here, we understand the geology. Why would we change what we want to do?\u201dA similar story comes from Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd., the third-best-performing Canadian energy producer since the oil crash. Advantage owes its success to a concentration on producing natural gas from a prime land position in Alberta\u2019s Montney shale formation and production costs that are among the lowest in the industry, CEO Andy Mah said in an interview. Advantage had corporate cash costs of 73 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent last quarter.Mah says the company was an early adopter of a philosophy that junior and intermediate energy companies need to structure themselves to be able to generate long-term profitability and corporate returns, rather than simply develop an asset and sell themselves to a major within five years. While shares of Calgary-based Advantage are down 7.8 per cent since July 2014, that\u2019s outperformed both the energy index and the price of natural gas, which has slid 23 per cent.\u201cThere are probably going to be less of those peaks than valleys, and you have to be able to make money in the valleys,\u201d Mah said in an interview. \u201cAt US$100 oil, were a lot of companies doing everything they could to minimize their costs? I would say probably not.\u201dInvestors are tired of seeing oil and gas companies take cash flow that they are generating from one asset and plow it into other assets that don\u2019t generate the same returns, said Justin Anderson, an analyst at Mawer Investment Management Ltd. Energy producers could attract investors who normally wouldn\u2019t consider them by sticking only to a clearly defined set of assets and by paying only special dividends, instead of regular quarterly dividends, he says.\u201cIf you find some great new play, start a new company,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd execute under that strategy and have investors invest under that new asset.\u201dHowever, the big, diversified players haven\u2019t fallen too far out of favour. Suncor Energy Inc., Canada\u2019s largest oil company by market value, is the second best-performing producer in the energy index since the crash. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which produced more than a million barrels of oil equivalent a day last quarter, is the fourth.For many investors, more important than size or focus is how companies allocate capital, and on that front, Suncor and Canadian Natural both took advantage of the downturn to acquire billions of dollars of assets in deals that analysts have generally viewed as bargains.\u201cGood management teams understand when to do land capture, when to build infrastructure, and then when to push on the pedal for growth,\u201d Paradigm\u2019s Lin said. \u201cVery few teams are good on that.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander and Michael Bellusci", "title": "Canada set to become world hub for blockchain stocks", "description": "A least 50 firms tied to blockchain and cryptocurrencies are set to list on Canadian exchanges, thanks in part to a junior market that's more comfortable with risk than other ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain-stock-listings-set-to-explode-in-canada-gmp-capital", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bitcoins.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 7, 2017 11:40 AM EST", "content": "A least 50 firms tied to blockchain and cryptocurrencies are set to list on Canadian stock exchanges in the next year, thanks in part to a junior market that\u2019s more comfortable with risk than other parts of the world, the head of securities firm GMP Capital Inc. said.\u201cThe level of activity in this market of quality plays, quality teams is as high as I\u2019ve seen since the internet age,\u201d\u00a0Harris Fricker, chief executive officer of the Toronto-based firm said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s offices. \u201cCanada\u2019s place in this is dramatically more important than what it was in the first phase of the internet.\u201dCanada is emerging as a hub for bitcoin and cryptocurrency stocks amid \u201ca virtuous circle\u201d of expertise and business, backed by a capital markets ecosystem that supports small companies, particularly on the TSX Venture Exchange, Fricker said. While that system has been geared toward miners and oil and gas companies in the past, the marijuana industry has surged to a market value of more than $17 billion ahead of recreational legalization in July, and at least eight cryptocurrency-related stocks are now trading in Canada.The University of Waterloo and University of Toronto are \u201chotbeds\u201d for the crypto industry, Fricker said. Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin\u00a0introduced the world to his ethereum blockchain in 2013, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, near Toronto. It all makes Canada \u201cnicely positioned\u201d to be a leading hub for these technology companies, said Fricker.Bitcoin surged above US$15,000 on Thursday, extending its advance this month to more than 50 per cent, sparking worries over a bubble in the digital currency. Fricker said that while there\u2019s bound to be volatility in the market he\u2019s not concerned about its long-term viability. \u201cI believe that bitcoin is a rapidly emerging new asset class,\u201d he said. \u201cAll bitcoin does is it makes mathematics the central bank governor.\u201dClosely held firms will likely go public by acquiring existing listed companies rather than initial public offerings, Fricker said. The so-called reverse takeover structure has been used for years in Canada\u2019s resource sector as it allows a public listing without having to file a prospectus with regulators or to woo investors through a stock sale.All bitcoin does is it makes mathematics the central bank governor\u201cYou have a viable system for listing and getting capital for companies, you are involving accredited investors \u2014 there\u2019s no pitching of this to the retired people of Canada \u2014 and there\u2019s a proper weighting of risk and opportunity,\u201d said Fricker, a Rhodes scholar who counts Alan Turing, the\u00a0English mathematician who broke the enigma code during World War II, as one of his heroes.A reverse takeover was how crypto miner Hive Blockchain Technologies Inc. listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. The Vancouver-based firm, which is backed by Canadian mining maverick Frank Giustra and counts GMP as one of its investment banks, has soared more than 200 per cent since it began trading Sept. 18. Hive has a market value of about $824 million, making it the nation\u2019s largest blockchain company.\u201cThe reverse takeover structure will prevail for now, until the regulators provide full instruction on where they live on clearing of prospectuses,\u201d Fricker said.GMP is also helping Hut 8 Mining Corp., a Toronto-based bitcoin miner to join the public markets in January through an RTO. Hut 8, named after the facility where Turing worked to break the enigma code and help defeat the Nazis, has an exclusive partnership with Bitfury Group to acquire and operate bitcoin mining data centers in North America.GMP Capital has refocused its firm to capitalize on the emerging industry. In September it created a dedicated blockchain team, which comprises eight investment bankers \u2014 about a quarter of its current contingent \u2014 and two research analysts.

The decline pared this year\u2019s advance to 8.9 per cent. The stock was trading down 1.83 per cent at $81.95 by mid-afternoon.Lower trading revenue and investment-banking fees contributed to a 15 per cent drop in earnings for Scotiabank\u2019s capital markets business, the only division to report a decline for the fiscal period ended Oct. 31. Trading revenue fell 42 per cent to $220 million from a year earlier, led by declines in fixed-income and commodities, while underwriting and advisory fees slipped 2.9 per cent to $165 million.\u201cAlthough modest, this was Scotia\u2019s first earnings miss in several quarters,\u201d John Aiken, a Barclays Plc analyst, said in a note to clients. \u201cMuch of the weaker earnings against last quarter related to a drop in trading revenues and foreign-exchange translation pressure from the stronger Canadian dollar.\u201dNet income rose 2.9 per cent to $2.07 billion, or $1.64 a share, from $2.01 billion, or $1.57 a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said Tuesday in a statement. Adjusted profit was $1.65 a share, missing by 1 cent the average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Scotiabank is the first Canadian lender to report fourth-quarter earnings and may be a harbinger for how the country\u2019s other large banks fare on the domestic front and in capital markets. Canada\u2019s six largest are expected to increase profit by an average 6 per cent in the period from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Gulberg.Here\u2019s a quick summary of key numbers from Scotiabank\u2019s fourth-quarter results:\u2022 Canadian-banking profit climbed to a record C$1.07 billion from $954 million a year earlier. \u2022 Total revenue rose 0.9 per cent to $6.81 billion in the quarter, missing analysts\u2019 $7.1 billion estimate. \u2022 Earnings from international banking advanced 6.6 per cent to $660 million from a year earlier. \u2022 Total annual profit increased 12 per cent to a record $8.24 billion.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong, Gerrit De Vynck and Anders Melin", "title": "Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke joins ranks of Canadian billionaires as shares of tech company take off", "description": "Lutke, who founded Shopify in 2004, regained his status as a billionaire after Shopify bounced back from a short-selling attack in October", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/coder-in-tweed-cap-is-newest-canada-billionaire-as-shopify-soars", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1127lutke.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 27, 2017 11:28 AM EST", "content": "An unapologetic computer nerd with a penchant for tweed caps has become one of Canada\u2019s newest billionaires by helping small merchants sell online.Tobi Lutke, a 37-year-old German immigrant who built\u00a0Shopify Inc. into one of tech\u2019s hottest stocks, was worth US$1.1 billion from company shares, options and sale proceeds at the close of trade on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He owns almost 9.7 million shares and options in Shopify, equal to about 11 per cent of the business.Lutke, who founded the company in 2004, regained his status as a billionaire after Shopify bounced back from a short-selling attack in October. A spokeswoman for the Ottawa-based company declined to comment on the chief executive officer\u2019s wealth.Lutke stands out among the handful of Canadian billionaires, most of whom hail from family firms built over generations. The CEO, with vivid blue eyes, has cultivated an image as a direct, even-keeled leader who has said he still codes for fun at home. He joins other Canadian billionaires including grocery kingpin W.G. Galen Weston and heirs to the Thomson media fortune, including Sherry Brydson and David Thomson.The Shopify founder is one of the few billionaires in the country to get rich from Canadian-made tech. BlackBerry Ltd. co-founders Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis were billionaires before the smartphone maker\u2019s value imploded.\u00a0But others like Uber Technologies Inc. co-founder Garrett Camp and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Joseph Tsai made their billions outside the country. Lutke now leads a pack of entrepreneurs striving to build the next wave of Canadian tech companies.Shopify\u2019s shares jumped 4.4 per cent to US$116.75 at 10:52 a.m. in New York on Monday for a market value of US$11.6 billion, after the company reported record Black Friday sales. They\u2019ve gained 588 per cent since their trading debut in May 2015, compared with a 36 per cent gain for the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same time frame. The company is the second-best performing stock on Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index this year.Lutke\u2019s stake in Shopify consists mostly of Class B multiple-voting shares that give him more than triple the voting power of common shares in company affairs, according to the Bloomberg index. And he\u2019s probably made about US$40 million after taxes from selling more than 200,000 Shopify shares since the company went public.Shopify helps small and medium-sized companies set up online stores, and provides tools to make e-commerce as smooth as possible, including payment options, cash advances and integrating into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s marketplace. The company has beat revenue estimates like clockwork quarter after quarter for its first two years as a public company. It employs 2,000 people and says more than 500,000 businesses use its platform, from well-known brands such as Nestle SA to proprietors flogging ugly Christmas sweaters.Still, questions about Shopify\u2019s rocket-like growth are starting to emerge. In October, short seller Andrew Left alleged many of the company\u2019s users weren\u2019t successful on the platform and that growth would eventually fall off a cliff. Investors were spooked and the stock dropped 12 per cent in a single day. When the company reported in October that growth of the total amount of goods sold through its platform was slowing, the shares fell a further 14 per cent.Lutke, ordinarily soft spoken, hasn\u2019t hesitated to strike back. He called Left a \u201ctroll\u201d whose claims were \u201cpreposterous\u201d but declined to give new metrics to show how many users left the company every month. The shares have since rebounded as Shopify heads into the busy holiday season and equity analysts encourage investors to buy.Lutke is taking others along on the company\u2019s share surge. His father-in-law, Bruce McKean, a former Canadian civil servant, is one of the largest shareholders with about a 4 per cent stake that was worth about US$388.5 million at Friday\u2019s close,\u00a0according to Bloomberg data.When Lutke was building Shopify and expecting his first child with his wife Fiona McKean, Bruce offered them a place to stay to save money, according to a Globe and Mail profile. McKean wrote cheques for Shopify to meet its payroll when cash flow was tight, the story said.McKean, who keeps a relatively low profile save for a LinkedIn picture that shows him surrounded by his grandchildren, served as an early chairman of Shopify from 2007 to 2010. He worked for the Canadian government overseas including in India, Thailand and Egypt. He\u2019s volunteered at mental health associations and Cuso International, a development organization that aims to reduce poverty globally. McKean declined to comment for this story.Lutke is also involved with a few non-profit ventures, including some related to coding such as Canada Learning Code, an organization that helps women and other groups who are under-represented in tech learn digital skills. In a Globe and Mail opinion piece last summer he argued that it\u2019s \u201cabout damn time\u201d kids learned how to code.That maxim has certainly paid off for him.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Where are Canadian stocks headed?

Taking the bearish view is Matt Barasch, Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Barasch has a 2018 year-end target of 16,300, just 1.8 per cent above Monday\u2019s close.After struggling through much of 2017 in the red, Canada\u2019s benchmark index is up 4.7 per cent this year, still the third-worst developed market amid a ferocious global rally.Belski has previously accused Canadian investors of harbouring an \u201cEeyore complex,\u201d after the morose Winnie-the-Pooh character. He believes strong company fundamentals will eventually override investors\u2019 gloom.Canadian investors tend to overreact to bad news and then pile into stocks when the outlook starts to brighten, he said.\u201cIn 2016, Canadian investors were positioned for Armageddon and US$15 oil and the banks to go bankrupt; when that didn\u2019t happen, it was a rush to own stocks,\u201d Belski said. \u201cIn 2017, it was doubt and rhetoric and what\u2019s going to happen with NAFTA and tariffs and all of a sudden when nothing was happening there\u2019s a fourth-quarter rally.\u201dHe believes Canada is full of strong companies, citing the railways and consumer stocks like Loblaw Cos., Canadian Tire Corp., Dollarama Inc., and Restaurant Brands International Inc. Belski recommends an overweight position in financials, industrials and materials.Belski has a strong track record of calling the market. In 2016, his year-end level of 15,300 was only 12 points off, and his 16,000 target for 2017 is so far on track \u2014 unless a Santa Claus rally gives it another boost.Barasch, meanwhile, sees Canadian stocks as essentially range-bound for the next year. He lowered his recommendation on the S&P/TSX to market weight from overweight, blaming stretched valuations and a lack of catalysts to drive further multiple expansion.Possible headwinds include trade threats, central banks unwinding their balance sheets, slowing domestic growth, U.S. tax reform, stagnating oil prices, U.S. election risk, and signs that China is beginning to slow.\u201cAs markets become more fully valued and earnings are recovering, your willingness to look past some of these issues begins to wane,\u201d Barasch said in a phone interview.Barasch arrived at his 16,300 target by taking his 2018 earnings per share forecast of US$930, a number he calls \u201cfairly aggressive,\u201d and applying a multiple of 17.5 times.\u201cThat would be close to the 90th percentile in terms of valuation historically for the TSX, so it\u2019s not an insignificant multiple,\u201d he said.\u00a0Barasch recommends an overweight position in real estate, food-staples retail, railroads and life insurers.Barasch only initiated coverage of the index in May 2016 with a 12-month target for May 2017 of 15,200. It closed out that month not far off at 15,350. He then called for the benchmark to close out 2017 at 16,300 before pushing that target back to 2018.The biggest risk to his 2018 outlook would be a sudden rise in oil prices, Barasch said. West Texas Intermediate is currently trading at about US$56 a barrel.\u201cIf six months from now oil\u2019s at US$65 and some of these other issues have cleared the deck, then we\u2019re probably going to be wrong, but absent that I think there\u2019s a good chance that 2018\u2019s just going to be a year where you\u2019re going to really have to grind it out for returns.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove, Kristine Owram and Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Investors want to know why watchdogs didn\u2019t raise a red flag on a deal that sent a penny stock soaring 1,000% and then collapsed", "description": "The episode has sparked criticism that Canada's light-handed approach to regulating its venture market needs to get heavier", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadas-light-touch-on-penny-stocks-draws-ire-as-deal-fails", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tsx-venture.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 9, 2017 11:13 AM EST", "content": "Investors are fuming over the collapse of a US$750 million mining deal that sent a tiny magnesium explorer soaring, sparking criticism that Canada\u2019s light-handed approach to regulating its venture market needs to get heavier.Canada\u2019s investment regulator won\u2019t be reversing the trades on West High Yield (W.H.Y.) Resources Ltd. from Oct. 5, when the Calgary-based penny stock surged almost 1,000 per cent on a deal to sell its main assets to an unknown buyer. The announcement \u201cdid not contain information which was either misstated or inaccurate,\u201d according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg News that the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada sent to an investor in the company.Perhaps not, but the deal certainly raised some red flags. West High Yield filed a purchase and sale agreement that showed Gryphon Enterprises LLC as the buyer prepared to pay US$750 million for West High Yield\u2019s main magnesium assets in British Columbia when the whole company was worth only US$16 million. That price tag would have made the deal the fourth-biggest mining-asset sale this year globally \u2014 underpinned by a company with no website, whose chief executive officer uses an AOL email address, and is based at a residential house built in 1992 in Swanton, Maryland.\u201cThe regulators are letting people like me down,\u201d Manoj Khandavelli, an investor in Newfoundland who put $50,000 into West High Yield, or 60 per cent of his personal portfolio. He says he read the sale and purchase agreement 10 times and believed West High Yield had at least a financing commitment.Khandavelli bought the stock on Oct. 5 at about $2.40. After an almost three-hour halt the stock \u2014 which trades under the ticker WHY \u2014 jumped to as high as CUS$3.80, from just 36 cents the previous day. It closed at $2, giving the company with no revenue a market value of $114 million. Trading has been halted ever since. The Alberta Securities Commission declined to comment on whether it\u2019s still reviewing the company and the deal.Khandavelli has already lost 17 per cent on paper, and stands to lose more if the stock plunges once it resumes trading following the announcement of the failed deal.\u201cIf they don\u2019t reverse the trade, I think that is setting up a bad reputation for the regulators,\u201d said Khandavelli who\u2019s talking to lawyers to see what his options are. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why they exist then.\u201dPaul Howard, a spokesman for IIROC, as the trading regulator is known, declined further comment beyond confirming the trading letter sent to investors.Unproven penny-stock companies, in Canada or elsewhere, are never for the faint of heart. Canada\u2019s TSX Venture Exchange has proven an attractive home for junior miners because its listing standards give them some breathing room to raise money while chasing claims \u2014 they don\u2019t require any net tangible assets, earnings or revenue, but rather look for \u201csignificant interest in a qualifying property,\u201d along with investment pledges. In turn, it\u2019s typically drawn investors chasing high-risk but high-payoff gambles.\u201cI\u2019d say Canada is a little more comfortable with risk,\u201d said Cromwell Coulson, chief executive officer of OTC Markets. The Venture market\u2019s reputation as the \u201cwild west\u201d of exchanges with its plentiful listings and plucky investors cuts both ways. \u201cThere\u2019s an advantage on the capital formation side and there\u2019s a disadvantage in that there\u2019s a little bit more of a light touch.\u201dWest High Yield\u2019s Oct. 5 announcement prompted 2,254 trades valued at almost $5 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average size of the trade that day was about 1,000 shares, indicating small buyers were active.\u201cThat\u2019s what investors that participate in this market are looking for, is that potential outsized return, but it comes with outsized risks too,\u201d Brady Fletcher, head of the TSX Venture Exchange, said in an Oct. 10 interview. The exchange has the ability to freeze a stock, force additional disclosure or unwind trades if it believes there\u2019s been fraudulent activity but, \u201cwe don\u2019t try to sit here and determine what\u2019s a viable business plan on our own,\u201d he said.West High Yield had continued to trade on Oct. 5 as more red flags appeared. Its filing stated Gryphon\u2019s legal representative was Baker McKenzie, yet the law firm said later it had no knowledge of the deal. Google searches showed that Gryphon operates from a modest two-story, beige clapboard apartment in Janesville, Wisconsin and that CEO Stephen Cummins had a previous run in with the Colorado Securities Commissioner for operating without a license.After the morning halt, the stock traded for another four hours before it was halted again the next morning. The Alberta regulator said it was reviewing the deal given the magnitude of the transaction.\u201cFor them to have that halt on, we didn\u2019t even have a chance to get out,\u201d said Ross Arnold, an Alberta-based investor who is part of Khandavelli\u2019s online group of West High Yield investors. \u201cLight bad news would have been okay. I\u2019ll take my losses. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve lost money but the first time I\u2019ve lost money because it was a gong show.\u201dPromoting liquidity and an active market are one thing, but a deal of this size should have had the regulators scrutinizing more closely and acting faster to halt trading, says Tony Simon, a former junior mining deal-maker and co-founder of Canada\u2019s Venture Capital Markets Association.\u201cThey should\u2019ve been on to every brokerage house and saying these trades are frozen \u2014 nobody gets a nickel out of this until further notice,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond ludicrous. The regulators are operating as though we were still in pre-Google Map days. You can look all this up online.\u201dMeanwhile Gryphon\u2019s lawyer, Thomas J. Kenan, said by phone that Cummins, the CEO, still expects to get the money very soon.

Resources Ltd., the tiny Canadian miner that last month announced it was selling its main assets for US$750 million, said the deal may fall through because the buyer doesn\u2019t yet have financing.West High Yield surged almost 1,000 per cent last month, after the company \u2014 which has no revenue \u2014 announced it had sold a magnesium deposit in British Columbia for 46 times its market value. The shares have been halted since Oct. 6 and the Alberta Securities Commission launched an inquiry, citing \u201cthe magnitude of this transaction.\u201d\u201cThere is substantial risk that the purchaser may not be able to obtain financing necessary to complete the proposed transaction,\u201d the Calgary-based company said Friday in a statement. \u201cThe purchaser does not have the financial resources\u201d to complete the deal without third-party funding.The West High Yield purchase and stock surge raised eyebrows among some investors in Canada, where the junior stock exchange has been dubbed the \u201cwild west\u201d for its volatile penny stocks. West High Yield traded for just 36 cents before the US$750 million cash deal was announced on Oct. 5.The statement Friday raises several questions about the transaction and the buyer. The company and purchaser Gryphon Enterprises LLC haven\u2019t agreed on how liabilities will be settled if assets \u201cfail to produce sufficient quantities and grade of materials in the time required\u201d to satisfy agreements, West High Yield said. These so-called take or pay agreements must be negotiated for the deal to take place, according to the statement. The company has the right to terminate the deal if US$500,000 isn\u2019t paid by Gryphon by Nov. 4. It said it hasn\u2019t yet received the payment.West High Yield also clarified the buyer\u2019s legal advisers. In the filing last month, the law firm of Baker McKenzie was listed as representing the purchaser. The law firm said at the time it had no knowledge of the transaction.\u201cThe purchaser advised the company that Baker McKenzie LLP was identified in the agreement in error, that it has not engaged Baker McKenzie LLP as legal counsel for the transaction and that Baker McKenzie LLP has no relationship with the purchaser,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s statement.There is substantial risk that the purchaser may not be able to obtain financing necessary to complete the proposed transactionWest High Yield Chief Executive Officer Frank Marasco declined to comment when reached by phone late Friday.Meanwhile, in the mountains of British Columbia, there is little evidence of a major development on the site of the magnesium mine that West High Yield agreed to sell, in what would be one the world\u2019s biggest mining deals this year.A neon pink plastic marker wrapped around the trunk of a fir tree and some felled logs are the only signs of mining activity on the site. Few had heard of the Record Ridge deposit in a remote forest next to the Washington state border or Calgary-based West High until the Oct. 5 announcement.As the news spread, WHY rose as much as 955 per cent in one day, an extraordinary surge even on the TSX Venture Exchange.

White, 46, inherits a 200-year-old firm greatly reshaped during Downe\u2019s tenure, but one that struggles to distinguish itself from its Canadian rivals.It's hard for me to say in a few sentences what Bank of Montreal is\u201cBill Downe has done an OK job, but Bank of Montreal is not in the same league as TD, Royal Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia,\u201d said Ian Nakamoto, an equity specialist with Raymond James Ltd. in Toronto. \u201cDarryl White\u2019s got to define the bank better in investors\u2019 minds. It\u2019s hard for me to say in a few sentences what Bank of Montreal is.\u201dBank of Montreal didn\u2019t make White or Downe available to comment on this story, but White said in a July 5 Bloomberg TV interview to expect \u201ca reasonably similar\u201d strategy under his leadership, with an emphasis on getting a greater share of earnings from the U.S.During his tenure, Downe, 65, focused on takeovers outside the Toronto-based firm\u2019s home turf. He doubled U.S. deposits and branches at its Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, expanded in Europe with a 2014 takeover of F&C Asset Management and bought a transportation-finance business from General Electric Co. a year later.Despite the changes, Bank of Montreal lags behind its peers on many financial measures. The firm has been at or near the bottom among the biggest Canadian banks over the past eight years based on return on equity, a measure of profitability. Its price-to-earnings ratio is the second lowest of those lenders, exceeding only smaller rival Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. It also has higher costs relative to revenue, meaning it\u2019s less efficient than competitors.Bank of Montreal shares excluding dividends rose 41 per cent under Downe\u2019s tenure, trailing the 71 per cent advance of the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index. The lender has been Canada\u2019s cheapest bank stock, measured on price to tangible book value, for almost all that period.\u201cI like BMO personally, but I know a lot of people who don\u2019t,\u201d said John Kinsey of Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Bank of Montreal shares. \u201cPeople got tired of waiting for Harris Bank to kick in and that may be part of the problem. But I\u2019m a patient guy.\u201dKinsey said regular dividend increases, as well as Downe\u2019s focus on strengthening the U.S. business, helped make the bank stronger than before. Still, he said he\u2019s keen to see what White will focus on.\u201cI\u2019d like to see where he does go in Canada,\u201d Kinsey said. \u201cI like the U.S. platform. It\u2019s a very good asset and it has growth in it, and he could build on that. And I\u2019d like to see what he has planned for international.\u201dWhite, the one-time head of BMO Capital Markets, has been viewed as the heir apparent since being promoted to chief operating officer in an executive shuffle announced last year. He joined the bank in 1994 and has held a variety of senior management positions, including head of equity capital markets and CEO of the BMO Nesbitt Burns wealth-management unit. White is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario\u2019s Ivey Business School and a director of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team.He takes over in a very different climate than his predecessor did in March 2007. On his first day, Downe announced 1,000 job cuts, or 3 per cent of the workforce, to rein in costs. The bank was stung that year by the biggest trading debacle in Canadian history at the time \u2014 a $680 million pretax loss from bad bets on natural gas options. Then, the global financial crisis hit.Still, Downe took advantage of the crisis to expand, advancing as others retreated. A key was the $4.1 billion takeover of Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in July 2011, which became the cornerstone of the bank\u2019s further growth in the U.S.\u201cHistory will show that the move to acquire M&I, when the market was not yet sure that the banking and housing downturn was over, was very well-timed,\u201d said Sumit Malhotra, an analyst at Scotia Capital, who rates the stock as sector outperform. \u201cBMO deserves credit for having both the capital and fortitude to be able to get it done.\u201dWhite\u2019s to-do list should include building up the personal-banking business in the U.S. so that the firm is less dependent on commercial lending, and boosting productivity in Canada, said Steve Belisle, a portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management, who helps oversee about $4 billion. Belisle hasn\u2019t owned the stock for about two years, but said he\u2019s willing to reconsider.\u201cI\u2019d like to see an interesting and tangible plan to improve productivity and improve the U.S. banking franchise,\u201d Belisle said. \u201cIf I see that, I would expect better returns out of BMO now that relative valuation has come down.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "TSX enjoys a balmy autumn, reaching record high on Friday", "description": "Deriving strength from range of supports, but some see a cold blast on the horizon", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/equities-markets/tsx-enjoys-a-balmy-autumn-reaching-record-high-on-friday", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/agettyimages-866407196.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 27, 2017 5:04 PM EDT", "content": "Not even a record high can shake Canadian stocks of their Eeyore complex.The S&P/TSX Composite Index\u00a0closed up 0.4 per cent to 15,953.51 on Friday, surpassing the record of Feb. 21 after outpacing its global peers since early September.\u00a0Financials have accounted for more than half of the advance, with industrials, consumer discretionary and energy also contributing.But the grind higher has been so long and tortuous, investors are loathe to put much faith in the rally.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for opportunities to take money off the table,\u201d Sadiq Adatia, who oversees about $18.5 billion as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, said in a phone interview. \u201cJust look at all the risks that are there. Whether it\u2019s NAFTA, real estate, consumer debt \u2014 all those things are negatives to Canada\u2019s economy.\u201dAfter wallowing in the red for a good chunk of the year, the S&P/TSX has gained 6.5 per cent since its September low. That strength is the result of improving oil prices, rising interest rates which have fattened banks\u2019 lending margins and, perhaps most important, a market that had simply become too cheap to ignore.The S&P/TSX\u2019s gains since\u00a0Sept. 8 surpass a 4.9 per cent increase in the S&P 500 Index and a 3.6 per cent gain in the MSCI World Index. This is a reversal from the first eight months of the year, when the Canadian benchmark fell 0.5 per cent compared with a 10 per cent gain for the S&P 500 and a 12 per cent increase for the MSCI World Index.Even with its recent gains, the Canadian index is way behind its U.S. counterparts, which have hit a series of record highs this year. The year-to-date gain for the S&P/TSX is just 4.4 per cent versus 15 per cent for the S&P 500. Canada still lags most developed markets, ahead of only Israel and Australia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canada\u2019s stock underperformance came, ironically, as its economy outpaced its Group of Seven peers with 4.5 per cent growth in the second quarter.\u201cThis Eeyore complex has been the defining theme for Canadian equities throughout 2017 and has resulted in Canada being one of the worst-performing equity markets year to date,\u201d Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a recent note, referring to the morose Winnie the Pooh character who sees doom and gloom at every turn.\u00a0Belski, who predicted the rebound in a Sept. 14 note that argued a \u201cBIG bounce is coming once calmer heads prevail,\u201d is optimistic that the rally has legs, pointing to stronger-than-expected earnings growth and improving fundamentals. Belski\u2019s year-end target for the S&P/TSX is 16,000, a gain of just 0.3 per cent from here, although he says that may be conservative.\u201cI think people are genuinely negative Canadian stocks and it\u2019s a classic game of catch up,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that investors need to ditch their obsession with commodities. \u201cAll they really care about is gold and oil, gold and oil, and if those two things are going up we feel better. We\u2019ve got great companies in Canada but we consider ourselves a failure unless gold and oil are going up.\u201dBelski recommends an overweight position in Canadian financials, industrials and materials. He likes the big banks, insurers, railways and individual stocks including West Fraser Timber Co., Waste Connections Inc., Canadian Tire Corp., Dollarama Inc. and Loblaw Cos.Belski\u2019s view is supported by technical analysis. The $1.7 billion Horizon S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF recently formed a golden cross, meaning the short-term moving average has broken above the long-term moving average \u2014 a buy signal.\u00a0Others are more reticent. Javed Mirza, technical analyst at Canaccord Genuity Corp., said the S&P/TSX seems overbought and predicted a near-term pause or pullback. The index \u201cmay hit an air pocket sooner rather than later\u201d if investors don\u2019t embrace commodity stocks, because financials can\u2019t carry the rally forever, added Martin Roberge, portfolio strategist at Canaccord.TD Asset Management, meanwhile, is underweight Canadian equities on the expectation that the economy will underperform the U.S. due to high household debt, modest oil prices and low productivity.\u201cAll that says to me that the Canadian economy should slow a little bit, while the U.S. economy looks like it\u2019s in pretty good shape,\u201d Bruce Cooper, who manages $344 billion as chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, said in an interview this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a preference for global equities over Canadian this year, and that continues to be the case.\u201dSun Life\u2019s Adatia is also worried about tapped-out consumers, a deflating housing market and the risk that NAFTA renegotiations could fall apart.

The measures, known as B-20 guidelines, require lenders to test a borrower\u2019s ability to pay at the greater of the Bank of Canada\u2019s five-year benchmark rate or 2 percentage points higher than the offered mortgage rate starting in January.\u201cThis is likely to lead to a significant number of non-prime borrowers to either defer purchasing a home or seek out a mortgage from lenders such as credit unions/caisse populaires\u201d and, failing that, a mortgage investment corporation or private lender, the RBC analysts wrote.Alternative lenders fell in Toronto trading, with Equitable falling 1.6 per cent and Home Capital declining 2.3 per cent at 12:58 p.m. trading.

One change was adding the Bank of Canada benchmark rate to the stress test criteria.\u201cThe revision to the stress test requirement is intended to dampen incentives to take variable or shorter-term fixed rate mortgages,\u201d RBC said in its note.Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken doesn\u2019t expect a significant impact on banks\u2019 lending volumes.\u201cWhat is out for debate is the impact it\u2019s going to have on the monolines or some of the other providers,\u201dAiken said in an interview. \u201cThis could have an impact on overall lending volumes and then potentially have an impact on the housing market in totality.\u201dBroadening the stress test will likely further slow housing activity, depressing demand by 5 per cent to 10 per cent once implemented, Brian DePratto, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank wrote in a note. Price growth will also suffer, with the changes expected to exert a drag of between 2 per cent and 4 per cent over 2018.\u201cOn balance, these changes should help enhance the resilience of the Canadian banking system in a rising interest rate environment,\u201d DePratto said.Insured mortgages, which were already subject to the stress test, were down 4.5 per cent on the year, according to OFSI data, while uninsured mortgage credit grew 17 per cent. While this is partly related to the rising prices of Canadian real estate, with more and more of it priced above the insurance caps, it also likely reflects the skew stemming from the past stress test requirements, DePratto said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Bread-and-butter research makes Manulife top Canada stock fund", "description": "Returns are up 8.8 per cent this year, double the TSX Composite", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/bread-and-butter-research-makes-manulife-top-canada-stock-fund", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/amanulife_lkp_006.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 29, 2017 3:53 PM EDT", "content": "The managers of Canada\u2019s best-performing large equity fund know their sandwiches.That\u2019s because they obsessively researched Premium Brands Holdings Corp., a British Columbia-based company that makes processed meats and packaged sandwiches, before buying it for the Manulife Dividend Income Fund.The stock has helped drive returns at the $3.3 billion fund up 8.8 per cent this year versus 4.3 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index. Over five years, the fund\u2019s 93 per cent return is almost double the index.\u201cWe learned a lot about the sandwich business from that investment,\u201d said Chris Hensen, senior portfolio manager for equities at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto.\u00a0In order to know their companies inside out, the four-person team focuses on revenue drivers, margins, capital allocation and cash flow. They\u2019ve met with as many as six management teams on a single day in order to unearth opportunities in unsung corners of the market.The fund, which is invested 65 per cent in Canadian equities, 15 per cent in U.S. stocks and 20 per cent in cash, was the top performing of 48 funds with assets of more than $1 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The fund\u2019s research on Premium Brands set it up to pounce when another sandwich company with the odd name of AdvancePierre Foods Holdings Inc. filed to go public in mid-2016.\u201cWe had brokers who were like, \u2018How in the hell are you guys on this thing?\u2019 \u201d\u00a0Hensen said. \u201cWell, if you did your work on Premium Brands you\u2019d understand the sandwich business, too.\u201dIn less than a year, AdvancePierre was acquired for US$40.25 a share by Tyson Foods Inc., nearly double its US$21 IPO price. Meanwhile, Premium Brands has advanced 344 per cent, including dividends, in the three years the fund\u2019s owned it.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for opportunities to gain some kind of insight that the market is either missing or not fully appreciating,\u201d said Conrad Dabiet, senior portfolio manager for equities at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as going on the Bloomberg terminal and looking at the P/E and saying the stock is expensive or cheap.\u201dThe fund\u2019s top holding, Waste Connections Inc., illustrates how this strategy can pay off.\u00a0The fund had held both Waste Connections and competitor Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd. for several years and knew that Waste Connections had a strong track record of acquisitions, while Progressive Waste had good assets but a weak management team.When Waste Connections bought Progressive Waste in 2016, the fund had insight into both companies, Dabiet said. \u201cThat day we were out buying more stock because of that confidence. Those opportunities are rare and they don\u2019t last very long, but that\u2019s why we need to be there to execute them.\u201dThe fund aims to have no more than 10 per cent exposure to any given business risk \u2014 for example, oil and gas producers or Canadian banks \u2014 and credits this for forcing it to look in the \u201cnooks and crannies\u201d of the market to find under-appreciated stocks.\u201cWe\u2019re never satisfied,\u201d Dabiet said. \u201cIt takes us years to truly understand a business, but once we get to that level it really is powerful because everybody\u2019s on the same page and we can execute very quickly.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Retail crisis is nowhere in sight for Canada\u2019s Dollarama", "description": "The discount retailer is growing faster than its U.S. peers, opening new locations and improving profit margins", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/dollarama-q2-profit-soars-to-131-8-million-as-sales-rise-11-5-from-last-year", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/dollarama.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 7, 2017 10:42 AM EDT", "content": "By Sandrine RastelloThe crisis afflicting much of the retail industry has spared dollar stores in Canada, where industry leader Dollarama Inc. keeps opening new locations and improving profit margins.Canada\u2019s largest dollar-store chain posted earnings that topped analysts\u2019 estimates last quarter and raised its gross-margin forecast for the year.

Vancouver is among a clutch of cosmopolitan, attractive cities around the globe where the appreciation in home prices is seemingly unstoppable. New-home prices have gained 5 per cent since March, the biggest three-month increase since 1990, data released earlier this month show. Prices in Hong Kong and Sydney also continue to soar.Woodhouse\u2019s decision to flout traditional investment strategies has so far proved to be a winner. With the roughly $60,000 he had in hand, he took out a mortgage and bought a wood-shingled townhouse near a coastal inlet east of Vancouver for $240,000. Five years later, he figures his house has risen about 60 per cent in value if sales of nearby properties are anything to go by. In the meantime, he\u2019s accrued a nest egg of roughly $24,000 from rental income, even after accounting for expenses, mortgage payments and taxes.Vancouver, consistently voted one of the world\u2019s most livable cities, shows just how difficult it is for policymakers to control runaway prices. Despite a succession of government tightening measures, including a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers, the price of the typical detached house surged to a record $1.6 million in July.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very frustrating for local residents, but I don\u2019t see that buying interest going away anytime soon,\u201d Frank Giustra, a mining and film magnate based in the city, said in an interview. \u201cAll this free money has driven assets through the roof in Beverly Hills, London, Paris, all these desirable places.\u201dIn the city of Vancouver proper, which includes the downtown and some of the poshest neighborhoods, sitting on a house can be more lucrative than working a job. A single-family property appreciated almost $600,000 on average in the area in 2016, according to Jens von Bergmann, a mathematician and founder of MountainMath Software, a Vancouver-based data analysis and visualization company. As a group, the value of the properties surged by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of Vancouver\u2019s residents, Von Bergmann calculated.Eye-popping returns \u2014 coupled with Canada\u2019s reputation as a stable sanctuary \u2014 has made Vancouver a particular magnet for global cash. British Columbia slapped a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers a year ago after data showed more than $1 billion of overseas cash flooded into property in the region, mostly from China.The levy had an immediate impact on overseas investor participation but not on prices. Foreign buyers, who accounted for as much as 17 per cent of sales by value before the tax, plummeted to 1.8 per cent the month afterward. The cost of a typical home fell no more than 4 per cent before resuming its climb, according to figures from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.That indicates that Canadians, as much as foreign investors, are inflating the market. It\u2019s easy to understand why. The price of a typical detached home in Vancouver rose 69 per cent in the five years through July, compared with a return of 51 per cent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index, the country\u2019s benchmark equity index, and 7.6 per cent for Canadian government bonds. Some 41 per cent of baby boomers said home equity made up more than 60 per cent of their household wealth, according to a survey by Manuflife Bank published in May. For 21 per cent, it made up more than 80 per cent.But as in many asset classes, timing can be everything.\u201cEspecially one that rises really quickly, there can be some really precipitous drops there too,\u201d said Andrew Hallam, whose book on how he built a million-dollar portfolio on a teacher\u2019s salary was a top-selling personal finance book on Amazon, said by phone from Phuket, Thailand. \u201cIf wages aren\u2019t increasing by 15 per cent a year, then houses can\u2019t. At some point, there\u2019s a tipping component there.\u201dOnce they tip, they can take a long time recover: It took about a decade for U.S. home prices to return to the peak they\u2019d reached before the housing market crash and more than 10 years for Toronto to recover levels lost in the late-1980s slump.\u201cIn this environment, every purchaser has become a speculator,\u201d says Rhys Kesselman, an economist and public-policy expert at Simon Fraser University. He believes a capital-gains tax on home sales is the way to cool the market. Property sellers don\u2019t pay taxes on gains made from a principal residence in Canada.\u201cWe tax our gains in the stock and bond markets, and small businesses, but we don\u2019t tax the money we put into homes,\u201d says Kesselman. \u201cThere\u2019s an extra incentive to put our money into housing. Savings and capital are diverted from the productive sector of our economy.\u201dThe New Democratic Party, which took power last month, campaigned on a speculator\u2019s tax, suggesting taxing gains on properties that are flipped could lie ahead. It\u2019s propped up by the Green Party, which supports the introduction of a capital-gains tax. Realtors have described any such move as \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d in a country where homeownership is considered a basic right, with many banking on real estate to fund their retirement.Still, it\u2019s not clear even that would have the intended effect in a city where homes to many appear to be the closest thing to a sure bet. Woodhouse says a capital-gains tax wouldn\u2019t faze him because he never intends to sell. He owns his primary home plus two rental properties, has paid the down payment on a fourth and is looking for a fifth to invest in. His plans to own 10 properties will be funded by working harder, belt-tightening and leveraging the equity in his existing homes.\u201cIf the values fall by half, I don\u2019t care \u2014 it\u2019s going to give me grocery money, clothes, a roof over my head,\u201d says Woodhouse, who quotes the 19th-century steel tycoon, Andrew Carnegie. \u201cThe way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "TMX clearing shift would undermine system, Canada pot firm says", "description": "'It undermines the efficiency of an independent marketplace and it completely undermines, in my opinion, the regulatory scrutiny'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/tmx-clearing-shift-would-undermine-system-canada-pot-firm-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/acolorado_pot_tourism_20170503.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 23, 2017 9:12 AM EDT", "content": "Any move by the Toronto Stock Exchange owner to stop settling trades for marijuana companies with U.S. operations would undermine the market\u2019s regulatory system, according to one Canadian pot company.CannaRoyalty Corp. already went\u00a0through a \u201cvery formal\u201d review with the Ontario Securities Commission in which its operations and assets were scrutinized before being allowed to list on an exchange, said\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Marc Lustig.

There are five marijuana companies listed on the TSX, another 18 on the TSX Venture, and 44 on the CSE, according to exchange data.Shares of CannaRoyalty fell 15 percent this month in Toronto amid the uncertainty, while other peers with U.S. exposure including Aphria Inc. declined 9.4 percent and iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc. dropped 12 percent. Aphria said in a statement Monday it\u2019s pleased the TMX is working to clarify the CDS issue.A major policy change is unlikely as more than a dozen companies have public exposure to the U.S. marketplace and regulators would probably not allow TMX to disrupt the liquidity in an market with more than C$2 billion worth of securities, said Julius Kalcevich, chief financial officer for iAnthus, which has offices in New York and Toronto.Any material change to CDS rules must go through an approval process with provincial regulators, according to an Ontario Securities Commission order. Commission staff would review the rule and allow a time period for public comment, according to the document.U.S. Clearing\u201cWhen you add all of that up, the stakeholders and the amount of money that could be impacted or left vulnerable, it\u2019s something that the regulators aren\u2019t going to take lightly,\u201d Kalcevich said by phone.As deliberations over Canadian continue, CannaRoyalty and iAnthus are also exploring clearing their trades in the U.S. CannaRoyalty has been approved for trading on the OTCQB venture market in the U.S. and is eligible to settle trades through the Depository Trust Company, Lustig said. iAnthus\u00a0currently clears between 20 and 30 percent of trade volumes through the U.S. and plans to shift more volume there in the event of a policy change, Kalcevich said.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said\u00a0James Munro, a partner and co-chair of the cannabis practice group at McMillan LLP\u2019s Vancouver office. \u201cUltimately, it will be the Ontario Securities Commission which will likely have to make a decision.\u201d\u00a0"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Preferred rally has some sizzle left in Canada, top manager says", "description": "'With that kind of background, it's hard to see anything bad happening to the asset class before the end of the year'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/preferred-rally-has-some-sizzle-left-in-canada-top-manager-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/meeting.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 17, 2017 10:07 AM EDT", "content": "Preferred shares have further room to gain in Canada as a revving economy keeps interest-rate hikes coming and credit quality strong, according to the manager of the best-performing fund in the sector.The Dynamic Preferred Yield Class Fund has returned 9.2 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

They\u2019ve rebounded from a slump in early 2016 after the shares reset with lower dividends to reflect Bank of Canada rate cuts. Some issuers responded by adding a yield guarantee to protect investors from further erosion.Dynamic invests about 78 percent of its fund in rate-reset preferred shares that offer a fixed dividend for 5 years until the next reset date. The fund began allocating more of its investments into Canada during 2015 when the central bank was cutting rates and the market was cheap compared with the U.S. Now it has about 85 percent invested north of the border compared with as little as 50 percent in Canada before December 2015.It\u2019s a bit trickier to find value now as some preferreds are no longer cheap and trading above par but a good chunk of the market still trades at a substantial discount compared with the U.S., Rouleau said.

Energy stocks account for 20 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s weight.However, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Canadian investors. Of the 143 index members that have reported second-quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beat analyst estimates and 30 per cent have missed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This is a significant improvement from the first quarter, when 49 per cent beat and 43 per cent missed, and an indication that corporate fundamentals are improving.\u201cInvestors are finally going to come to grips with Canadian growth and earnings growth is a little bit better than everybody thought so that\u2019s where you can get more upside,\u201d Belski said.An upbeat earnings season hasn\u2019t had much impact on valuations yet. The gap in forward price-to-earnings between the S&P/TSX and the S&P 500 Index is the biggest it\u2019s been since 2008. Several strategists and investors say a gap this big can\u2019t last and will either be narrowed by declines in the U.S. or gains in Canada.\u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made for the bout of serious underperformance in Canada to subside,\u201d Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a recent note.Any recovery in the S&P/TSX will need energy stocks behind it, given their importance to the benchmark. Although there are plenty of unknowns for oil prices \u2014 including OPEC\u2019s commitment to production cuts and U.S. shale producers\u2019 ability to fill the gap \u2014 there are also signals that investors are getting more bullish on energy.Traders invested $42 million in the iShares S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF in July, the biggest exchange traded fund tracking Canada\u2019s energy index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That inflow was the largest since September 2016, a month when oil prices rose 7.9 per cent and energy stocks gained 3.5 per cent.Canadian oil producers are also more resilient than they were before the downturn following significant cost-cutting efforts. Meanwhile, the price discount between Western Canada Select and WTI has narrowed to about $10, the smallest in more than two years and down from a high of more than $40 a barrel in 2013 \u2014 another positive sign for the Canadian oil patch.\u00a0A rebound in Canadian stocks also won\u2019t get far without the help of financials, which account for 34 per cent of the S&P/TSX. Financials have lost 0.5 per cent this year as concern about overheated housing markets weighed on shares of the big banks.Belski said that will change as investors look for dividend growth as an alternative to bonds in a rising-rate environment.

Trump\u2019s plan is \u201cstill to be confirmed,\u201d said SNC Chief Executive Officer Neil Bruce.\u201cThe Canadian infrastructure market is far more attractive for us, certainly in the short term, than the U.S. market,\u201d Bruce said last week in a telephone interview. \u201cIf you just look at the whole process, the commitment to do that, the U.S. is starting two or three years behind Canada.\u201dBruce is looking to bolster SNC\u2019s backlog of contracts after it tumbled 24 per cent in a year to $9.58 billion. While Canadian projects remain a major focus, the Montreal-based company is also adding to its international footprint with its $3.6 billion purchase of the U.K.\u2019s WS Atkins Plc, a deal that closed last month.\u201cIf you take the bidding activity that we are involved in, plus our bid-to-win ratio, I\u2019m confident of replenishing the backlog\u201d in the second half, Bruce said.SNC shares have dropped 7.3 per cent this year through Friday, while Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index was little changed. On Friday, the last trading day before a holiday Monday, SNC declined 0.3 per cent to $53.60.In the U.S., Trump has promised a plan to invest US$1 trillion over 10 years upgrading deteriorating roads, bridges, airports and other assets.For SNC, potential contract wins both internationally and in Canada \u201cposition the stock for outsized returns in the foreseeable future,\u201d Frederic Bastien, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc., said Aug. 4 in a note to clients. The shares have a potential return of 27 per cent over the next 12 months, based on the average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. SNC has 10 buy recommendations, two holds and zero sells.Canada made up a little more than 40 per cent of SNC\u2019s revenue last year, compared with about 11 per cent for the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Australia was the company\u2019s second-biggest jurisdiction, accounting for 19 per cent of 2016 sales. The addition of Atkins widens the company\u2019s geographic reach and bolsters its capabilities outside the energy industry.The purchase, which boosts SNC\u2019s global workforce to about 50,000, will lead to cost savings of $120 million by the end of next year. About $30 million of that will be realized this year with the rest coming in 2018, Bruce said. Most of the benefits will probably come from grouping offices together and eliminating duplicate functions such as investor relations, as well as a \u201cpretty small\u201d number of job cuts, the CEO said. He didn\u2019t provide specific figures.\u201cFrom an operational perspective there\u2019s no real overlap in terms of the work that Atkins does and the work that we do,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThe areas that will provide the cost synergies have more to do with real estate. We have got lots of offices in similar locations. We are looking to sell it if we own it, or find a way of optimizing on a lease basis.\u201dBloomberg "}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Don't fear REITs when interest rates rise \u2014 unless you are in Canada", "description": "Canadian REITs tend to have longer-term leases and less tenant turnover, meaning fewer opportunities for landlords to raise rents.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/dont-fear-reits-when-interest-rates-rise-unless-you-are-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 8, 2017 8:44 AM EDT", "content": "Real estate investment trusts aren\u2019t to be avoided as interest rates rise \u2014 except in Canada, where lower cash-flow growth and higher leverage make them riskier bets, according to the head of securities at a $6.5-billion real estate fund.\u201cIf you look at the empirical evidence, REITs\u00a0actually outperform in a rising-rate environment,\u201d Corrado Russo, global head of securities at Timbercreek Asset Management Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cThey tend to do better both on a relative and on an absolute basis.\u201dToronto-based Timbercreek analyzed the performance of U.S. REITs over the past nine rate-hike cycles by the Federal Reserve and found that they rose in eight of those nine periods.\u201cIt\u2019s counter to perception, but real estate is much more correlated to a strong economy than it is inversely correlated to interest rates,\u201d said Russo, who manages $1.2 billion of public securities.This is less true in Canada, where REITs tend to have longer-term leases and less tenant turnover, meaning fewer opportunities for landlords to raise rents. This results in steady cash flow and higher leverage, creating bond-like securities that are more sensitive to interest rates than their global counterparts, he said.Some of this divergent performance is playing out this year as the Fed and Bank of Canada raise borrowing costs. The biggest ETF tracking Canadian REITs, the iShares S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index ETF, is down 1 per cent. By comparison, its U.S. and global counterparts are up 1.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.\u201cIn an income environment, they outperform; when people want growth, they underperform. And in a rising rate environment, people want growth,\u201d Russo said. \u201cIf you want to protect against interest rate rises in Canada, you should be going outside of Canada to get your REIT exposure.\u201dRusso recommends U.S. industrial and data-center REITs, German office REITs and exposure to undervalued Hong Kong REITs.There are also opportunities in Canada if you know where to look.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to invest in Canada, it\u2019s got to exhibit either very attractive growth in cash flow or underlying net asset value, or it\u2019s got to give me a good valuation,\u201d Russo said. \u201cIt\u2019s where do we see management teams that have the ability to add value.\u201dFor growth, Timbercreek holds office-focused Allied Properties REIT and retail-oriented First Capital Realty Inc. for their development projects, which will add to cash flow and net asset value in the coming years.For value, Timbercreek likes OneREIT, another retail name that has been upgrading its portfolio by removing weak tenants and replacing them with higher-quality names like Walmart and Dollarama. OneREIT announced Friday that it\u2019s selling its assets to Strathallen Capital Corp. and SmartREIT at a 15 per cent premium to Thursday\u2019s closing price.\u201cIt\u2019s one of our largest holdings so we expect to benefit from that,\u201d Russo said.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "'Astoundingly clean' balance sheet: Canada's auto parts makers just keep roaring along", "description": "'It might surprise people that these stocks have been really good investments'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/peak-u-s-autos-may-not-mean-peak-canadian-auto-parts-stocks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/0917-biz-xfpmagna.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 2, 2017 8:02 AM EDT", "content": "TORONTO \u2014 It\u2019s hard to be a Canadian auto-parts bull when U.S. car sales are falling, NAFTA negotiations are about to start and the loonie is rising, but there are reasons for investors to hold their nerve.No subsector of the S&P/TSX Composite Index has generated more consistent outperformance when bond yields are rising, according to Matt Barasch, Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.The Bank of Canada raised rates last month for the first time since 2010 and the market is expecting at least one more increase this year, pushing long-dated bond yields to the highest since 2014.Over 11 episodes of rising Canadian and U.S. bond yields since 2000, auto suppliers have generated a median return of 19 per cent, Barasch wrote in a note.\u00a0Looking at the four periods of rising yields since the financial crisis, Magna International Inc. and Linamar Corp. were the sixth and seventh best-performing stocks on the S&P/TSX, respectively.The sector has generated a minimum of 18 percentage points of outperformance versus the broader index when rates are rising, Barasch found.\u00a0Some of this is attributable to the auto-sales cycle, as higher rates generally signal a stronger economy, but \u201cregardless, their outperformance stands out,\u201d he said.\u201cAgainst this backdrop, we believe the auto parts sector continues to trade at attractive valuations with the index\u2019s two largest names \u2014 Magna International and Linamar \u2014 trading well below the U.S. peer group average,\u201d Barasch said.Magna trades at a price-earnings ratio of 8.4 per cent and Linamar Corp. trades at 7.9 per cent compared with 13 per cent at both BorgWarner Inc. and Johnson Controls International Plc.Magna, Linamar and\u00a0Martinrea International Inc. have gained an average of 23 per cent over the past 12 months compared with 5 per cent for the broader composite.\u201cWe think people pay a little bit too much attention to the cyclicality of the auto industry,\u201d said David Baskin, president of Toronto-based Baskin Wealth Management, which has about $1.1 billion of assets under management, including shares of Magna. He likes its \u201castoundingly clean\u201d balance sheet and global diversification, which help insulate it from consumer vagaries.Warnings have been growing that the auto-sales cycle has plateaued and may be turning downwards, particularly in the U.S. where 2017 sales are expected to decline from last year\u2019s record level. General Motors Co. posted a 15-per-cent drop in July sales on Tuesday, the worst in more than a year.\u00a0Ford Motor Co. reported its biggest sales decline since October and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV had its second-worst tumble this year.Add to this the looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement,\u00a0which President Donald Trump has vowed to tilt more in the U.S.\u2019s favour, and a Canadian dollar that\u2019s jumped nearly 10 per cent since May \u2014 making exports less competitive \u2014 and it seems like a perfect storm for Canada\u2019s auto suppliers.Martin Roberge, North American portfolio strategist at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., called auto suppliers \u201cclassic value traps,\u201d in a note.But David Tyerman, transportation and industrial products analyst at Cormark Securities Inc., is unfazed.\u201cIt might surprise people that these stocks have been really good investments,\u201d he said. He points out that U.S. vehicle affordability is at record highs, while ownership rates and sales per capita are below the peaks of previous cycles. Canada\u2019s auto-parts stocks can do well even when the industry is flat or slightly negative because of strong backlogs, he said.\u201cMagna looks particularly interesting because its growth is accelerating right now,\u201d said Tyerman, who rates the stock a top pick.In contrast to the U.S., Canadian auto sales surged to a record for July and the country is on track to report a fifth consecutive annual high. European auto sales, meanwhile, have improved for three consecutive years, hitting a nine-year high in 2016, but demand is expected to wane in the back half of 2017.As for renegotiating NAFTA, Martinrea\u2019s chairman doesn\u2019t expect major changes.\u201cWe are the postcard for NAFTA.

The stock has gained 6.3 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 0.3 per cent decline for Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Operating ratio, a widely watched measure of railroad productivity that compares expenses to sales, improved to 58.7 per cent from 62 per cent a year earlier.

The fund is divided about 50-50 into Canadian and U.S. equities, with the U.S. holdings providing diversification from Canada\u2019s commodity-heavy stock market.\u201cWe\u2019re a growth investor but we\u2019re not hyper-growth,\u201d said Dina DeGeer, senior vice-president and team lead of the Mackenzie Canadian Growth Team. \u201cWe don\u2019t like deeply cyclical businesses, we don\u2019t like commodity businesses, we don\u2019t like capital-intensive businesses.\u201dInstead, Mackenzie looks for stocks with a strong leadership position in their sector. \u201cWe love duopolies because they have pricing power and if you\u2019ve created a big strong business moat you don\u2019t have new competition coming in,\u201d DeGeer said.One of the fund\u2019s top holdings is Canadian National Railway Co. The Canadian rail industry is a quintessential duopoly, dominated by CN and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and CN gives Mackenzie exposure to natural resources while reducing the cyclicality that\u2019s typical of commodities, DeGeer said.Another top investment is toy-maker Spin Master Corp., which makes up just under 5 per cent of the fund\u2019s holdings. DeGeer described the Toronto-based company as \u201ca real gem.\u201d The company counts Hatchimals and PAW Patrol, two of the hottest toys going, in its stable.We're a growth investor but we're not hyper-growth\u201cWhile the industry long-term grows 4 per cent organically, they have grown at least two-and-a-half to three times that,\u201d she said, citing the innovative culture that won Toronto-based Spin Master three Toy of the Year awards in February. \u201cI think they\u2019re just in a class of their own.\u201dOther top Canadian holdings at April 30 included Royal Bank of Canada, Telus Corp., CAE Inc., Metro Inc. and CCL Industries Inc., a labels and packaging manufacturer that entered the money-printing business when it acquired Innovia Group for $1.13 billion in December. Innovia makes the polymer banknotes used in Canada, the U.K., Mexico and several other countries.\u201cIt\u2019s a very stable business with four to five per cent organic growth year in and year out, always getting operating efficiencies and very big free cash flow,\u201d DeGeer said. \u201cThey have made a lot of acquisitions in their history and they have been excellent allocators of capital.\u201dThe Mackenzie Canadian Growth Fund\u2019s strategy of focusing on stable businesses that generate consistent free cash flow growth works in most market environments except when the market \u201cgets very excited and concentrated in one area,\u201d such as the tech bubble of the late 1990s, Arpin said.That\u2019s not the case this year. The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index is flat this year, lagging most of the developed world.\u201cIn markets like we\u2019ve seen for the last five or so years, which have been sloppy, slow, sluggish, that\u2019s probably our best environment,\u201d Arpin said.Bloomberg News"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Will Canada's potential pot market go up in smoke?", "description": "More marijuana outfits are listing on the TSX Venture Exchange and Canada Securities Exchange as the country gears up to legalize recreational pot within the next year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/theres-a-marijuana-frenzy-that-could-end-very-badly-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/canada_marijuanaa.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 17, 2017 3:25 PM EDT", "content": "By Jen SkerrittThere\u2019s one bummer question haunting all the marijuana businesses popping up between British Columbia and Newfoundland.How much do Canucks like weed, eh?A year before recreational cannabis is expected to become legal in Canada, there\u2019s an explosion in companies cultivating the stuff. At least 10 marijuana outfits have new listings this year on the TSX Venture Exchange and Canada Securities Exchange. Some 51 enterprises have gotten the green light to grow pot, and 815 applicants are in the queue. All told, it could be enough to raise the country\u2019s raw-weed output more than tenfold.This is where skeptics see froth. \u201cIf you ask people today why they don\u2019t use it, it\u2019s a small percentage who say \u2018because it\u2019s illegal,\u201d\u2018 said Neil Boyd, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. \u201cIn many respects there might be an overestimation of demand.\u201dLong-time users and growers insist he\u2019s wrong, but investors aren\u2019t so sure.\u00a0Producer MedReleaf Corp. tumbled as much as 28 per cent last month in the worst debut for a Canadian IPO in 16 years amid concern pot stocks are overvalued. Shares of Canopy Growth Corp., the country\u2019s first billion dollar marijuana start-up, are down 21 per cent in the past three months.The North American Medical Marijuana Index, which tracks leading cannabis stocks in the U.S. and Canada, has plunged 21 per cent since\u00a0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government in April unveiled its plan to legalize the drug by next July, 16 years after Canada permitted it for medical use.Of course, some of the decline may be attributed to the situation in the U.S. Many in the Trump administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions in particular, are no friends to the industry. For Canadian companies, the risk isn\u2019t political.\u201cThere seems to be a little bit of investor fatigue,\u201d\u00a0said PI Financial Corp. analyst Jason Zandberg. He said they\u2019re having trouble differentiating between the producers, new and old, and what might give them competitive advantages.That\u2019s to be expected, according to marijuana bulls, in a brand-new market that hasn\u2019t even arrived yet. Parliament still has to pass the recreational law (though there\u2019s little question it\u2019ll do so). Then the federal government will have to write rules on taxation, and each province will have to decide how to regulate distribution.\u201cNothing is going to be perfect right off the hop,\u201d said Jon Bent, a licensed medical marijuana grower who has been cultivating plants on his 11-acre farm outside Winnipeg for five years. \u201cIt\u2019s baby steps \u2014 and the industry is moving quickly.\u201dThe question is whether it\u2019s going too quickly, considering the variety of estimates about how much recreational weed Canadians will end up regularly ingesting. Some educated guesses are that about 15 per cent of Canadians partake now, legally and otherwise. That\u2019s around 5.4 million people, roughly the population of Colorado, which gave the nod to recreational marijuana in 2014. Medical and recreational sales there rose 56 per cent last year, to nearly $1 billion, according to Cannabase, operator of the state\u2019s largest market.One projection, from the Canadian Parliamentary Budget Officer, is that 4.6 million people age 15 and over will use cannabis at least once and consume 655,000 kilograms next year, and that 5.2 million will be doing so by 2021. Other reports peg future recreational consumption at 420,000 kilograms a year with sales reaching $6 billion by 2021, Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. said in November. For its part, the government agency Health Canada anticipates a mature medical marijuana market will be around $1.3 billion.That could underestimate the number of Canadians who will refuse to buy from corporate weed growers, said Chad Jackett, 38,\u00a0who runs a medical marijuana dispensary in Squamish, British Columbia, and uses cannabis oil everyday to treat nerve pain. His concern is that new regulations will sideline the independent farmers who advocated for the plant for years, and grow small amounts. \u201cI will definitely not be using anything\u201d from one of the big outfits, Jackett said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have enough of my own then I\u2019ll be getting it from somebody else whom I trust.\u201dUnderscoring how confusing it all is, a few alarms are being sounded that there won\u2019t be enough to pass around on Day One. In fact, Colorado faced some shortages of legal supplies in the first year. A similar rush emptied shelves in Nevada, where sales started on July 1.By 2015, Colorado had the opposite problem,\u00a0according to Denver-based researcher Marijuana Policy Group, with supplies approximately 51 per cent larger than demand. The average price sought by wholesalers for recreational flower has fallen 52 per cent since lawful sales began, according to Cannabase.None of this has dampened enthusiasm in some quarters in Canada.\u00a0MedReleaf has raised $100 million, all of which is going toward expanding capacity, said Chief Executive Officer Neil Closner. He said the disappointing IPO was due to a general market slowdown and \u201cnot a reflection of demand for our product.\u201d Like others in the business, he is confident Canadians will be keen enough to lawfully imbibe that the blossoming industry will be supported.Bent, the pot farmer outside Winnipeg, is just as upbeat. Surveying part of his crop, in a room brimming with 30 bushy plants ripening under the glow of hot lamps, he said the oft-misunderstood reefer is definitely going mainstream. Even his cousin, a \u201creligious librarian,\u201d became a convert after experimenting in Denver, he said. \u201cThese are people who would never, ever try it\u201d if it were illegal.\u201cIt\u2019s really gaining popularity and really starting to lose that stigma,\u201d Bent said. \u201cI see a lot of money being spent.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Jennifer KaplanBloomberg "}]
