Since then, they\u2019ve been little changed even as market transactions have fallen sharply.To be sure, risks remain. Young home buyers have never faced anything other than historically low mortgage rates and many will have to refinance over the next few years, while policy makers remain concerned about a cluster of highly indebted borrowers.Growing signs of a sustainable housing market allow the Bank of Canada to keep moving ahead with modest interest-rate increases in an economy that\u2019s otherwise at full capacity. Government officials can also hold back on new interventions that could spook households.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re settling into this environment in Canada where price growth is going to be flat in real terms,\u201d something that hasn\u2019t happened outside of a recession since the 1990s, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said by phone from Toronto.Prices and sales showed modest gains or losses for October in reports Thursday from the Canadian Real Estate Association and from the Teranet land registry. That\u2019s a switch from most of the last year where they swung in response to tougher mortgage qualification rules and the first interest-rate hiking cycle from the central bank in almost a decade.Home sales held close to their 10-year average after falling for a second month in October, the realtor group said. Benchmark prices rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, and gains in Vancouver and Toronto were close to the national average.Canada would stand out if it comes through its housing boom without a crash like those seen in the U.S., the U.K. or Spain. \u201cOverall, yes the medicine is working,\u201d Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe are reaching some sort of landing, how soft it will be I don\u2019t know, but we aren\u2019t in a free-fall by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Tal said.Even with the latest figures showing stability, it could take years to unwind the imbalances that have built up. The rise of the million-dollar home in some of Canada\u2019s biggest cities has also created affordability challenges for buyers as builders struggle to offer new supply.\u201cIts absolutely fair to say the Canadian housing market is off the boil,\u201d Lascelles said, adding a note of caution: \u201cThere is no pre-ordained conclusion here.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Vancouver leads Canada's first home sales decline in five months", "description": "Sales in Vancouver fell by 1.5 per cent in September and benchmark prices declined 1.2 per cent, CREA said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/vancouver-leads-canadas-first-home-sales-decline-in-five-months", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 15, 2018 10:52 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian home sales declined for the first time in five months as activity in Vancouver and Toronto weakened.Sales in the west coast city fell by 1.5 per cent in September and benchmark prices declined 1.2 per cent, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Monday.

Consumers still have to prove they can be resilient to higher interest rates, Donald said Tuesday at the Bloomberg Canadian Fixed Income Conference in New York.\u201cThis is something that we are going to have to deal with for several years,\u201d she said.Consumers no longer have the capacity to lead Canada through another recession the way they did after the global financial crisis a decade ago, said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. While Canada\u2019s fastest population growth in decades provides some support to demand for housing, high debt levels remain a problem that could exacerbate the next recession, she said.Past 2020, \u201cit\u2019s really going to hit the fan,\u201d Caranci said. \u201cAt that point you have high level of indebtedness combined with income stress happening simultaneously.

The central bank will re-assess its path after moving the policy rate to 2 per cent, he said, adding that will help avoid a consumer-led downturn. \u201cI don\u2019t see an accident waiting to happen in the housing sector,\u201d Marion said.U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields could rise towards 3.5 per cent in a time of government deficits and tightening by the Federal Reserve, Marion said, something that will be felt in Canada and its mortgage rates, Marion said.All three economists said that the risks of higher interest rates will be felt more around 2020. Many mortgage borrowers have fixed-rate loans for terms of up to five years, meaning rate increases over the past year won\u2019t affect their payments for a while.Additional global risks include potential for a U.S. slowdown or recession in the next few years and trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Donald said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe and Natalie Wong", "title": "Cost of owning a home in Toronto, Vancouver \u2018off the charts\u2019 \u2014 and likely to get worse, warns RBC", "description": "Typical Canadian household forking out 54% of income for housing, the highest in 28 years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/cost-of-owning-a-home-in-toronto-vancouver-off-the-charts-and-likely-to-get-worse-warns-rbc?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/house-money.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 28, 2018 12:02 PM EDT", "content": "The cost of owning a home in Canada is at the highest level in 28 years and likely to get only more onerous as interest rates continue to rise, according to a report from Royal Bank of Canada.Carrying a home, including the cost of a mortgage, property taxes and utilities, took up 54 per cent of a typical household\u2019s pre-tax income in the second quarter, the Toronto-based bank said in a report on Friday.

In addition, across most economies there has been no significant recent rise in mortgage rates, which have even fallen in some cases.\u201cSo, the classic \u2018trigger\u2019 for house price declines is largely absent,\u201d Slater said. \u201cHowever, rising rates are not strictly necessary for prices to start falling.\u201dHouse prices are falling in Australia, down almost 3 per cent in the year through August in major cities, and 5.6 per cent in the Sydney market. Meanwhile, three of the nation\u2019s four major banks raised mortgage rates in recent weeks, blaming higher funding costs. The increases came even as the central bank leaves official rates at a record low.Oxford said it compared markets across OECD countries from 1970 to 2013 and found a clear negative relationship. Where valuations had risen 35 per cent or more above the long-term average over that period, real house prices fell 75 per cent of the time over the following five years, it said.\u201cThis points to many OECD countries seeing stagnant or negative real house price growth in the next few years: the scope for a further house price \u2018melt-up\u2019 in highly valued markets looks extremely limited,\u201d Slater said.Stretched valuations also matter because house price changes can have a significant impact on economic activity, Oxford said, citing a sample of 83 house price booms.

In a separate report, the Ottawa-based agency said retailers recorded a 1.2 per cent sales drop in April, also unexpected.The reports \u2014 which come on the heels of other disappointing data \u2014 raise questions about the underlying strength of the economy and could cast some doubt about how quickly the Bank of Canada proceeds with future rate hikes.\u201cThe soft patch in Canadian data continued today,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors.The Canadian dollar fell after the reports, and was down 0.2 per cent to 74.95 US cents at 8:38 a.m. in Toronto trading. Investors pared their expectations for rate hikes this year. Swaps trading suggests a 54 per cent probability of a hike at the Bank of Canada\u2019s next rate decision on July 11, down from about two-thirds earlier in the day. A hike isn\u2019t fully priced in until October, with chances of a second hike by December below 50 per cent.As recently as last month, more than two more rate hikes had been priced in this year, adding to the three increases the Bank of Canada has already taken.The \u201cbad data make it even more difficult for the Bank of Canada to hike rates in July,\u201d said Mendes. There is \u201cstill time for the data to turn\u201d before the next rate decision with the April GDP release and June employment data due before then, he said.The inflation numbers were a major surprise given economists were anticipating a sharp pick-up in prices in May on the back of higher gasoline prices. However, a sharp decline in telephone services and cars last month acted as a brake on inflationary pressures coming from higher gas prices, the effects of minimum wage increases and higher mortgage rates.On the month, consumer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in May, down from a 0.3 per cent gain in April and well below expectations for a 0.4 per cent gain, Statistics Canada reported.Core measures of inflation \u2014 seen by officials as a better gauge of underlying inflation trends \u2014 posted their lowest readings since January.The weak April retail sales numbers reflected a sharp decrease in car sales. Even excluding autos, the numbers came in below what economists were expecting. Sales excluding car dealers were down 0.1 per cent, versus economist expectations for a 0.5 per cent gain. Retail sales were also down 1.4 per cent once price changes were factored out.One explanation for the poor retail numbers may have been poor weather, Statistics Canada said.\u201cInclement weather in many parts of Canada may have contributed to the overall decline in April,\u201d the agency said in a statement.Nor are the inflation numbers out of line with the Bank of Canada\u2019s own estimates. Its last forecasts \u2014 released in April projected second quarter inflation to average 2.3 per cent \u2014 and the numbers are currently on track for 2.2 per cent. That\u2019s still a lot higher than what the nation has been able to produce recently, with inflation averaging just 1.4 per cent between 2015 and 2017.Yet, the recent pattern has been one of weakness across the economy \u2014 which could be a concern. The poor inflation and retail sales data have come on the back of weak manufacturing sales and employment data \u2014 all within the context of growing trade worries.\u2022 The average of the Bank of Canada\u2019s three key core\u00a0inflation\u00a0measures fell to 1.9 per cent in May from 1.97 per cent in April \u2022 The \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cmedian\u201d core rates were unchanged at 1.9 per cent, while the \u201ctrim\u201d rate fell to 1.9 per cent from 2.1 per cent \u2022 Inflation for services was unchanged in May at 2.3 per cent.

In addition, the mortgage market looks set for a particularly heavy year of renewals in an environment where debt-servicing costs are already rising at the fastest pace in a decade.All we know is it's going to be painful, but how painful isn't quite clearHow well Canadian households can weather the squeeze has become one of the biggest questions for policy makers and will determine whether the economy is headed for a mild, or sharp, slowdown. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will address the topic in a speech on Tuesday.\u201cThe economy has never been as levered as it currently is, and the economy is far more interest sensitive than it has been in the past, to a degree that we don\u2019t have certainty over how each interest rate hike is going to affect Canadian consumers,\u201d Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cAll we know is it\u2019s going to be painful, but how painful isn\u2019t quite clear.\u201dThe heavy debt burden is one of the reasons the central bank has been reluctant to raise borrowing costs further, after hiking interest rates three times between July and January. Given the nation\u2019s debt load \u2014 as of February, households had a record $2.1 trillion of mortgage and non-mortgage debt \u2014 Poloz estimates the economy is 50 per cent more sensitive to rate hikes than in the past.Here\u2019s what households are up against:Canada is entering its busy season for real estate, with purchases concentrated in the April to July window. Some 47 per cent of existing mortgages need to be refinanced this year versus 25 per cent to 35 per cent typically, according to Ian Pollick, head of North American rates strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.At the same time, the country\u2019s biggest banks are raising key mortgage rates. Toronto-Dominion kicked it off Thursday, hoisting its five-year fixed mortgage rate 45 basis points to 5.59 percent. Royal Bank followed with its own hikes Friday.New mortgage stress tests are pushing some borrowers from the big banks to alternative lenders charging higher rates.\u201cThat\u2019s an unfortunate outcome of the stress test,\u201d Will Dunning, an economic consultant who specializes in the housing market, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIn that sense, the stress test is not reducing risk. It\u2019s increasing risk.\u201dThe vise is tightening. According to Statistics Canada, total payments on debt made by Canadian households rose 6.7 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and the interest-paid component climbed 9.2 per cent.

Tougher mortgage rules went into effect on Jan. 1 just as higher interest rates began to bite, and the market\u2019s on edge, waiting to see if a downturn that began last year will accelerate under the added pressure.\u201cLots of people are sitting on the sidelines waiting or hoping that prices would fall,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto-based Realosophy Realty Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see a rapid increase in prices or a big turnaround this year.\u201dToronto\u2019s housing market has cooled for seven months, with prices falling and listings surging. The market has begun to buckle under a raft of measures to curb prices that were soaring at a 20 per cent clip a year ago and saddling Canadians with debt, part of a global real-estate boom that\u2019s swept cities from Hong Kong to New York.The latest move requires that even people with a 20 per cent down payment, who don\u2019t need mortgage insurance, prove that they can make payments at much higher rates. The so-called stress tests, which already exist for insured mortgages, will be calculated at a rate of at least 2 percentage points above the contracted rate.And those rates are going up. The country\u2019s central bank increased its overnight target rate three times in the past year, to 1.25 per cent. The country\u2019s big banks have followed suit, nudging mortgage rates to a four-year high.Reality is sinking in as buyers update their pre-approved mortgages at the higher rates, Dawna Borg, a sales representative at Remax Premier Inc., said in an email.\u201cThey seem to feel defeated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel they will fail the stress tests and they will be forced out of the market.\u201dAnalysts at Macquarie Capital Markets Canada Ltd. say the new stress tests and mortgage-rate hikes in Canada\u2019s environment of \u201chyper-leveraging\u201d will have a more severe impact than policymakers expect. The rules alone will reduce purchasing power by as much as 17 per cent, the bank said in a report. Add in the mortgage-rate increase and that number jumps to about 23 per cent.The Magnelli family is feeling the effects. Mom Loredana Magnelli has saved for a few years to help her two kids, age 30 and 26, put together down payments to purchase apartments in Toronto. Their price point of about $300,000 each seemed like a viable opportunity two years ago. Now, that seems impossible.\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at a $400,000 to $450,000 mortgage and your interest rate is going to be higher, that\u2019s huge money,\u201d Magnelli said. She considered adding another mortgage to her own house to help get her kids their dream homes, but ultimately decided against it. They\u2019ve put a stop to their search for now in hopes that home prices will fall to more affordable levels.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is 30. He\u2019d like to have a place of his own.\u201dAmid the crunch in single-family homes, Tim Syrianos, president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, has seen a \u201ctremendous spike\u201d in interest for more affordable housing types like condominiums, townhouses and semi-detached homes. While the city\u2019s detached-home segment tumbled in the second half of 2017, condominium prices rose at a double-digit pace.Activity is also seeping out into surrounding suburbs that are near public transit and far more affordable than the city core, real-estate agents say.And just when you think the Canadian housing market is down for the count it tends to find a second wind. Vancouver\u2019s housing market plunged for five months after policymakers introduced a foreign-buyers tax in 2016 but has been recovering steadily since last year. Toronto\u2019s economy meanwhile is booming with the unemployment rate falling to 4.3 per cent in December from 5.5 per cent a year ago even as the city remains a magnet for immigrants.Syrianos\u2019s big worry isn\u2019t a cooling market but the lack of supply. \u201cIf supply continues to be as tight as it is, we will see double-digit increase in values.\u201dTwo of his clients for example were looking to buy a new house after having a baby but no longer qualify for a bigger mortgage under the new stress tests. They\u2019re renovating instead.\u201cYou\u2019re creating a heated renovation segment of the market and you\u2019re stifling supply,\u201d Syrianos says. \u201cIt just leads to more values going up faster than they should and making it harder for the average Canadian to buy a home.\u201dUltimately, policymakers and brokers alike want steady, incremental home price gains. Double-digit price growth was volatile and dangerous, said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, real-estate management company. The new stress test will help make sure \u201cthat we don\u2019t have unqualified people creating bidding wars,\u201d he said in a phone interview.The Toronto Real Estate Board will release an outlook for the market on Tuesday with January numbers due in the next several days.

Canada\u2019s housing market slumped in the early 1990s after that rate-hike cycle and a recession.\u201cThe Canadian economy has experienced an unprecedented period of hyper-leveraging,\u201d analysts including David Doyle wrote in the note released Thursday. According to Macquarie, this is underlined by the fact that:About 30 per cent of nominal GDP growth has come from residential investment and auto sales over the past three years. This is about 50 per cent greater than what has been experienced in similar prior periods. The wealth effect from rising home prices has driven nearly 40 per cent of nominal growth in gross domestic product over the past three years, about two to four times the amount experienced previously when the BoC was hiking rates. Even as this has occurred, fixed business investment and exports have struggled, limiting the ability for a virtuous domestic growth cycle to unfold. This again is in sharp contrast to similar periods in the past when these were accelerating.New mortgage stress-test rules will also have a larger impact than estimated, Macquarie said. The new rules in isolation are expected to reduce buyers\u2019 maximum purchasing power by as much as 17 per cent. That jumps to about 23 per cent after incorporating the rise in mortgage rates since mid-2017, according to the note.Governor Stephen Poloz has indicated high household debt could make the slowing impact of rate hikes harsher, and that the impact of 2017\u2019s increases will not be fully clear for 18 months, Doyle said.\u201cWhen taken together, these observations mean the Bank of Canada is proceeding with hikes despite uncertainty surrounding the severity of tightening performed so far,\u201d Macquarie writes. \u201cThis elevates the risk of policy error.\u201dMacquarie expects only one more rate hike in either April or July.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely", "title": "Mortgage bond market may get a boost from new Canadian rules", "description": "It could make sense for more lenders to package uninsured mortgages into bonds, which over time could become a cheaper and more reliable form of funding", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/mortgage-bond-market-may-get-a-boost-from-new-canadian-rules-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/0104sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 4, 2018 3:04 PM EST", "content": "The Canadian government is increasingly reluctant to insure mortgages against default. That may end up giving new life to a nascent bond market in the nation.For decades, most home loans made in Canada were made by the biggest banks and guaranteed by the government\u2019s housing agency. In late 2016, regulators tightened the requirements for qualifying for that insurance, resulting in more people doing without it: about three-quarters of the mortgages made by federally regulated banks last year didn\u2019t have government backing. Nearly half the nation\u2019s $1.5 trillion (US$1.2 trillion) of home loans are now uninsured.For lenders, consumers\u2019 growing demand for loans with no government backing creates a thorny problem: funding. A bank can easily bundle government-insured loans into bonds and sell them to investors. That bond market was $463 billion as of Sept. 30.Without that backing, banks and other lenders have to rely on deposits, asset-backed commercial paper, and other forms of funding that can be more expensive and less accessible, particularly for smaller firms. That\u2019s why it could make sense for more lenders to package uninsured mortgages into bonds, which over time could become a cheaper and more reliable form of funding, said Moti Jungreis, head of global markets at Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s TD Securities. He thinks an RMBS deal could be sold this year.\u201cThe market has to come up with a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise there will be no financing available for mortgages.\u201dThere are some headwinds though.\u00a0Investors became cautious with housing market debt last year after regulators said one mortgage lending company, Home Capital Group Inc., failed to properly disclose possible mortgage application fraud. And the market for bonds backed by uninsured loans is tiny.Right now, it includes just a $200.8 million 2014 offering from alternative lender MCAP Corp. and a small portion of the bonds backed by $2 billion of uninsured home loans from Bank of Montreal.\u00a0Investors will have to devote the time to understanding a different kind of security. The Canadian asset-backed securities market was around $41.8 billion overall as of Sept. 30, and is dominated by credit-card bonds, which account for 64.5 per cent, according to DBRS Ltd.Adding to the trouble of starting up the market, the federal government is worried about rising household debt levels for Canadians and nosebleed prices for homes. And regulators introduced rules effective Jan. 1 that make it tougher for home-buyers to get a mortgage without government insurance from a federally regulated bank, further\u00a0tightening access to home loans.\u201cI think the first bond sale past the post will have to be attractive to investors given the inherent risk with being close to the top of the market,\u201d\u00a0said Mark Carpani, a portfolio manager at Ridgewood Capital Asset Management in Toronto.The biggest commercial banks can still sell securities known as covered bonds, which are backed by a pool of home loans that stay on the lender\u2019s balance sheet. The most likely candidate to experiment with uninsured residential mortgage bonds would be smaller banks and finance companies known as \u201calternative mortgage lenders,\u201d\u00a0said Jamie Feehely, a structured finance analyst at bond rating firm DBRS Ltd. in Toronto.\u00a0If prime mortgage rates rise another half or full percentage point from their current level of around 3.5 per cent, which seems like a real possibility given expectations for central bank rate hikes, the securities would likely yield enough to entice investors, Feehely said.One company that would consider selling mortgage bonds backed by uninsured loans is Home Capital,\u00a0said Brad Kotush, chief financial officer of the company, in an emailed statement. The firm would want the market to become more active first, he said.\u201cHome would be open to taking advantage of any opportunity that made sense in the context of our funding strategy,\u201d Kotush said. Home Capital Group was rescued last year by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which gave the lender a $2-billion credit line and about $400 million of equity capital.Growth in the market for bonds backed by Canadian home loans without government insurance will likely take time as issuers and investors learn about the securities, said TD\u2019s Jungreis.\u201cThere\u2019ll be a couple of deals and people will figure out what they want to get paid,\u201d Jungreis said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity for us and the market, but it will have to evolve.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Allison McNeely and Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "Canada\u2019s housing risks haven\u2019t gone away \u2014 they\u2019ve just moved to the shadows", "description": "New rules that make it tougher to get a mortgage are driving borrowers to a lending market where there is less oversight and regulation", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/risk-shifts-to-shadows-in-canadas-whac-a-mole-housing-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/shadow.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 13, 2017 11:51 AM EST", "content": "Mortgage broker Samantha Brookes is trying to figure out how to get one of her clients out of a housing-fueled debt hole.The couple, a 59-year-old Toronto city worker and her husband, 58, have so much debt that they stopped making payments on the $410,000 mortgage for their suburban home. They wanted to refinance but regulations imposed last year will disqualify them. In a few weeks, they won\u2019t even qualify for an uninsured loan at an alternative lender as more rules come into effect.They opted for a third route: adding a second mortgage with an interest rate of 10.5 per cent to pay off their debt. Their salvation came from a private unregulated lender, a move many other Canadians are making as the government tries to rein in a home-price surge that\u2019s driven household debt to a record. But like a giant game of Whac-A-Mole, the risk to the financial system from tapped out borrowers is merely shifting \u2014 this time to a market where there\u2019s no oversight from the country\u2019s national bank regulator and new stress-test rules don\u2019t apply.People need solutions, it could be temporary, but at least they have a home over their head\u201cWe\u2019re transferring risk from the regulated segment to the unregulated segment of the market,\u201d Benjamin Tal,\u00a0deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIf we have a significant correction, clearly the unregulated markets will suffer even more because that\u2019s where the first casualties would be. And then you will see it elsewhere.\u201dBrookes says more than 90 per cent of her business in the last two months has been lining up funding from non-bank and private sources, or shadow banks \u2014 versus a 50-50 mix previously.\u00a0\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to stop buying, they\u2019ll just find different ways of doing it.\u201dFor the government, it may be a case of careful what you wish for. Anxious to prevent a repeat of the kind of taxpayer-funded bank bailouts that occurred in the U.S. after its housing crash a decade ago, the federal government has been moving to reduce its exposure to the mortgage-insurance market.Rules last year added a stress test for insured loans backed by the government. That sent more buyers to the uninsured space, where a 20 per cent down payment is required. As of Jan. 1, these borrowers will also need to qualify at a rate two percentage points higher than their offered rate, a move which could lower mortgage creation by as much as 15 per cent, Canada\u2019s bank regulator has said.Roughly 90 per cent of new mortgages in Toronto and Vancouver this year are now uninsuredEarlier changes have already had a dramatic effect. Uninsured mortgages made up about three-quarters of new loans at federally regulated banks this year,\u00a0up from two-thirds in 2014, according to the Bank of Canada. Roughly 90 per cent of new mortgages in Toronto and Vancouver this year are now uninsured, in part because government insurance is forbidden on homes priced over $1 million and prices have risen, the bank said.On the one hand, taxpayer risk has dropped as insured mortgage origination fell 17 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the bank said in its semi-annual financial system review. About 49 per cent of all outstanding mortgages are now uninsured, up from 36 per cent five years ago. The credit quality of some of the loans at the big banks have also improved as borrowers buy less expensive homes, the Bank of Canada said.The rules, along with other measures such as a foreign-purchase tax, have had an initial bite \u2014 with Toronto house prices falling 8.8 per cent from May to November and the average price of a home posting the first annual drop since 2009. Vancouver prices have reclaimed new heights after cooling earlier this year.But the risks to the financial system haven\u2019t gone away. In the uninsured space, mortgages are increasingly going to highly indebted households and for amortizations for longer than 25 years, the central bank said. And like Brookes\u2019s clients drowning in house debt, more borrowers are turning to lenders whose activities fall outside federal regulatory scope.These include credit unions and mortgage-investment corporations, pools of money from individual shareholders, which aren\u2019t subject to the new rules,\u00a0Tal said. Credit unions hold about 17 per cent of uninsured mortgages, according to the Bank of Canada.Canada\u2019s patchwork regulatory system also doesn\u2019t encourage comfort, Tal said. Banks are regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, but credit unions and brokerages are overseen provincially. Mortgage-finance companies are semi-regulated, and MICs and other private lenders are unregulated.MICs currently make up about 10 per cent of mortgage transaction volume, or 6 per cent of dollar volume, according to research from Tal at CIBC said. Transaction volume will likely grow to about 14 per cent under the new rules, and in the event of defaults in a housing correction, those MIC investors would be open to losses, he said.\u201cAnything over 10 per cent is sub-optimal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this market to be too big because you don\u2019t want to increase the blind spots.\u201dSound underwriting is an important element in maintaining a strong and stable Canadian financial system and OSFI will continue to monitor the country\u2019s housing and mortgage markets under the new rules, Annik Faucher, spokeswoman for Ottawa-based organization said in an email.Like her clients, Brookes\u00a0said borrowers will get creative to get around the new rules. Options include companies like Alta West Capital, Fisgard Asset Management Corp. and Brookstreet Mortgage Investment Corp. or just a wealthy individual willing to lend at interest rates starting around 12 per cent.Fisgard didn\u2019t respond to request for comment, Brookstreet declined to comment while Chuck McKitrick, chief executive officer at Calgary-based Alta West said MICs are regulated\u00a0by the country\u2019s securities commissions and various real estate bodies.\u201cWe\u2019re scrutinized a hundred different ways,\u201d said McKitrick. \u201cThere\u2019s very little difference between us and other regulated entities.\u201dDespite the expectation that MICs will see more business, McKitrick said the big financial institutions will adapt to new regulations to keep lending. Shawn Stillman, a mortgage broker at Mortgage Outlet Inc., said banks could lower their mortgage rates so homebuyers would still qualify under the new stress-test rules.\u201cThe bank doesn\u2019t care because they\u2019re still going to make their fees and get their money,\u201d Stillman said by phone from Toronto.Alta West predominantly lends to entrepreneurs and new Canadians, groups that typically have a harder time getting a mortgage at one of the big banks. Its rate of mortgages in arrears is about 2 per cent, he said. That compares with about 0.2 per cent at the big banks and about 0.4 per cent for the credit unions, according to data compiled by the Canadian Credit Union Association.\u201cPeople need solutions \u2014 it could be temporary, but at least they have a home over their head,\u201d Brookes said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "BoC sees risks easing, but cure is higher rates and tougher rules", "description": "The central bank cautioned that the process to rein in risky borrowing will take time and the outcome is uncertain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-sees-financial-system-vulnerabilities-easing-1", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 28, 2017 3:56 PM EST", "content": "The Bank of Canada is optimistic higher interest rates and regulatory efforts to rein in risky borrowing will make the country\u2019s financial system more resilient, though the process could take time to unfold and the outcome remains uncertain.In its semi-annual financial stability report, Canada\u2019s central bank painted a picture of a housing market where key steps have been taken to improve the quality of lending, particularly in the most expensive cities such as Toronto.

The currency was down 0.2 per cent to C$1.2798 per U.S. dollar at 10:48 a.m. in Toronto trading.The central bank cited three main reasons why it expects risks to mitigate over time: income growth, new mortgage finance policy measures and higher mortgage rates.New regulations \u2014 the federal government\u2019s in 2016 and the banking regulator last month \u2014 limit the creation of new highly indebted households, and should reduce demand in cities like Toronto where speculative demand has been a factor, the central bank said.\u201cThe effects of tighter mortgage rules implemented last year have already improved the quality of new insured lending,\u201d the Bank of Canada said. \u201cIncome growth, new mortgage finance policy measures and higher mortgage rates are expected to mitigate this vulnerability over time.\u201dOne area that remains a major concern for the central bank is the growing share of uninsured mortgages, those with loan to value ratios at or below 80 per cent, which is being fuelled by higher Toronto and Vancouver home prices and tighter qualification rules for insured mortgages. The issue was a focus for a second consecutive report, with the central bank saying a portion of these loans are displaying riskier characteristics.The proportion of low ratio loans to highly indebted households is trending up, and the share of these mortgages amortized longer than 25 years is also increasing, it said. The issue has been particularly prominent in regions with the highest price growth, such as Toronto.The Bank of Canada analyzed the impact of October regulatory changes by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which make it more difficult to qualify for insured mortgages. It concluded they are \u201cexpected to decrease the proportion of highly indebted households among new borrowers\u201d particularly in high price growth regions.But the end result is still uncertain, the central bank cautioned.\u201cAs borrowers and lenders adapt to the new OSFI guidelines, it will take some time to assess the extent to which this vulnerability is being alleviated,\u201d it said.Based on the impact of the federal government\u2019s 2016 measures to curb riskier insured mortgages, \u201ca material impact\u201d on new lending could take as long as six months, it said. And because of the largest stock of debt, it could take \u201cseveral years\u201d to have a significant impact on overall vulnerability.The central bank had a similar message for how higher borrowing costs and the new regulatory measures will impact housing markets like Toronto. It should reduce demand, \u201cbut the impact of these policy measures on the market is uncertain,\u201d it said.\u201cThere is uncertainty about how borrowers and lenders will react to the new OSFI measures,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is also uncertainty around the sensitivity of the housing market to higher interest rates.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
