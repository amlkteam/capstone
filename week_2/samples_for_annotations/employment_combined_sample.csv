 Analysts David Mericle and Ronnie Walker estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 25 per cent, up from a previous forecast of 15 per cent, as “more workers will lose their jobs and a larger share of them will be classiﬁed as unemployed,” according to a research note late Tuesday. The rate would then remain near 10 per cent at year-end, near the highs of the last recession, they wrote. 
 Goldman Sachs revised the figures following last week’s monthly jobs report showing a record contraction in payrolls in April and a 14.7 per cent unemployment rate, the highest since the Great Depression era. A jobless rate of 25 per cent would be in line with estimates of the peak during the Depression. 
 Despite expectations for a bigger hit to the labor market, the analysts see relief in sight for the world’s largest economy, as some indicators point to a slow resumption of activity and companies are starting to ease back to business. Reopening still presents one of the largest risks, though, with second waves of infections possible along with a renewed tightening of restrictions, they said. 
 The new forecast also includes a deeper hit to quarterly gross domestic product, with an annualized second-quarter decline of 39 per cent instead of 34 per cent. 
 But the recovery is also seen as faster than before with a 29 per cent gain in the third quarter, suggesting a more “V-shaped” or immediate recovery path for the economy. They had previously estimated a 19 per cent jump.

They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell’s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in MarchThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.“Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,” Powell said. “The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.”While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksCongressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump’s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank’s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.“While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,” Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would “continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,” but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.“When this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise.Wall Street’s three major averages closed around their session lows.

Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels — less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were “horrifying.”West Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn’t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico’s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20.

In other words, a lot of the bad news is already built into the market.”The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent for the week, largely holding a rally that propelled it 18 per cent higher in three days last week.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump’s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.For individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn’t require members to travel to Washington — as long as the bill does not have any “poison pills” Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the “the president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation’s economy as we work through this crisis.”The size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation’s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third — and biggest — plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing. It also will send tens of billions in fresh aid to states.Bloomberg.com"
5,Bloomberg News,Kait Bolongaro,"Canada received over 500,000 EI applications this week","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said half a million Canadians, or about 2.5 per cent of the labor force, have applied for jobless claims this week, smashing previous records and suggesting the nation is already in a deep recession.",,,,,2020-03-20,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-received-over-500-000-ei-applications-this-week-1.1409633,,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said half a million Canadians, or about 2.5 per cent of the labor force, have applied for jobless claims this week, smashing previous records and suggesting the nation is already in a deep recession. 
 Speaking outside his residence in Ottawa, Trudeau said Service Canada has received more than 500,000 applications this week, 20 times the number recorded in the same week a year ago. The Minister of Families, Children and Social Development’s office confirmed Trudeau was referring to applications for unemployment insurance. 
 The speed of the meltdown in the labor market has no precedent. The largest number of jobless claims for a whole month was 499,200 in 1957, according to Statistics Canada data. 
 “This is of course an unprecedented situation and it is putting a lot of pressure on our system but we’re on it,” Trudeau told reporters Friday at Rideau Cottage, where he is governing from home after his wife tested positive for coronavirus. 
 The number highlights just how quickly economic activity has come to a halt as Canadians stay home and governments tell businesses to close to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. It also indicates the depth of the contraction may be worse than even the most pessimistic analysts had feared. 
 ‘Depression of 2020’ 
 “There are going to be large contractions in economic activity, that’s unavoidable when you’re shutting down portions of the economy,” said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto Dominion Bank. “What you’re ultimately hoping for is you don’t get the negative dynamic on duration.” 
 In Canada’s case, the economy is facing a double whammy of the pandemic and tanking oil prices, devastating an energy sector that still accounts for about one-tenth of output. 
 “This is going to be the depression of 2020,” said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc. 
 The extent of the slowdown also suggests policy makers will need to have a bigger response to keep companies afloat and avoid a long downturn, Rosenberg said. Trudeau’s government has announced an aid package worth CUS$82 billion (US$57 billion), which is mostly temporary tax deferrals. The Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by a full percentage point, but still has its benchmark above other countries. 
 “It’s one thing to have everybody filing for claims but if they have no job to go back to, it’s going to compound things,” he said.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was “closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.”Powell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said “we do like our current policy stance,” before repeating the Fed’s reference to taking action if needed.The Fed’s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would “use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.”The vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the “fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.”The decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today’s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed “must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.”The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday’s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.As recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to “act as appropriate,” which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they’re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries — known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is “carrying the domestic burden and the global burden” because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. “The fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.”With assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"
7,Bloomberg News,Shelly Hagan,Healthy labour market is providing wage relief in Canada,"Canadians have become more confident in the prospect of wage hikes if they leave their job, another sign of health for the country’s labour market.",,,,,2020-02-13,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/healthy-labour-market-is-providing-wage-relief-in-canada-1.1389701,,"Canadians have become more confident in the prospect of wage hikes if they leave their job, another sign of health for the country’s labour market. 
 The share of workers who say switching jobs would leave them better off financially has jumped sharply since 2018, according to a Nanos Research Group poll conducted for Bloomberg. Almost two in 10 respondents said their wages would increase if they lost their jobs or chose to find a new one. That’s an improvement from prior surveys, including one in December 2018, when as few as 12 per cent said they would be able to find a job that pays more. 
 The results are broadly consistent with a strong labour market over the past year, and appear to reflect confidence that the economy can sustain recent wage gains. Stronger wage expectations would be good news if they encourage labour churn, whereby workers feel free to leave their jobs to find something more suitable. 
 It’s a process Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said is worth nurturing because it’s an important source of productivity gains. In December, Poloz said labour churn has picked up recently, indicating workers have the confidence to leave their positions for new ones. 
 “The average wage increase of people who switch jobs is very high, in the 10 per cent to 12 per cent range, because people are finding the right matches,” Poloz told reporters Dec. 12 in Toronto. “Those matches inevitably bring higher productivity.” 
 
 The Nanos poll results are in line with findings published by the Bank of Canada in its fourth quarter survey of consumer expectations, which found rising probabilities of Canadians voluntarily leaving their jobs. The pick up in wage expectations largely reflects improved sentiment among younger workers, the data show. 
 Last year, the nation’s economy added almost 300,000 jobs, the unemployment rate hovered near four-decade lows and wages rose near the fastest pace since the recession. The strength of the labour market, in part, allowed the Bank of Canada to keep interest rates on hold, even as its counterparts in other countries lowered rates due to slowing economic growth. 
 “We’re now several years into having unemployment in the six per cent to below six per cent range,” said Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada. “That’s going to help build confidence in the job market overall.” 
 It’s clear the labour market boon hasn’t been equally distributed across Canada. Residents in the Prairies are most pessimistic about job pay, with only 14 per cent expecting higher pay if they left their job. That region is also the only one where more than half of respondents expect they would get paid less if they had to find a new job. Confidence in Quebec was highest of all provinces, with 26.2 per cent saying they would get paid more in a new position. 
 The poll, a hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,000 people, was taken between Jan. 27 and Jan. 29. The survey has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

Economists in a Bloomberg survey had anticipated starts would be 205,000.It’s the highest level of new construction in four months, after a slowdown at the end of 2019, and suggests builders may be responding to the recovery in demand in some of the nation’s largest housing markets. At the same time demand is increasing, a shrinking supply of available homes is driving up prices in several cities.“With recent data pointing to further tightening in demand-supply conditions in many resale markets, a solid pace of home building to start the year will be welcomed,” Josh Nye, a senior economist at RBC Economics, said in a note to investors.In a separate report Monday, Statistics Canada said building permits rose 7.4 per cent in December, more than double the 2.8 per cent median forecast from economists. The increase is consistent with the housing starts data for January, and included a 47 per cent surge in Toronto intentions, the most 2014.A combination of steady population growth, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs have brought buyers back into markets that had been lacklustre for much of 2018 and early 2019. Combined with shrinking supply, the rising number of buyers has driven bids for homes higher in places like Toronto, where benchmark prices are up 9 per cent over the past year.Starts in Toronto were up 51 per cent from December, on a seasonally adjusted basis, CMHC said. Montreal, another market that has been doing well, saw starts rise 53 per cent.Overall, Canada recorded a 13.6 per cent jump in multiple urban starts during the month, while single-detached starts fell 0.9 per cent. Bloomberg.com"

That represents the biggest annual increase since October 2017, the month controversial stress tests for mortgage eligibility were announced by the country’s financial regulator. The price gains are being fuelled by a combination of strong demand and shrinking supply, with new listings down 17 per cent in January from a year ago.“Strong sales up against a constrained supply continues to result in an accelerating rate of price growth,” Jason Mercer, director of market analysis for the realtor group, said in the statement.Toronto’s housing market is bouncing back after a dismal period that lasted through 2018 and early 2019. A combination of steady population growth, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs have brought buyers who had been sidelined by the stress tests back into the market, Mercer said.Still, the tightening supply has had a dampening effect on sales in recent months, with the number of transactions falling 2.7 per cent in December. That trend reversed sharply in January, with sales rising 4.8 per cent during the month on a seasonally adjusted basis to the highest level in more than a year.The average sale price for a detached homes was $1,038,247 in January, up 10.5 per cent from a year earlier.

The Fed also raised its overnight reverse repurchase rate by the same amount to 1.5 per cent. It also extended term and overnight repos at least through April. The central bank had earlier signalled such measures were possible.In addition, the FOMC downgraded its assessment of household spending to say it has been rising at a “moderate” pace, instead of its earlier characterization of the rate as being “strong.” The committee repeated that economic activity has been rising at a “moderate” rate, with “strong labour market conditions.”Officials gathered with financial markets on edge as a deadly virus in China weighs on its economy and could threaten global growth. Policy makers also endured another attack from President Donald Trump, facing reelection in November, who reiterated in a tweet Tuesday his latest call for the Fed to cut rates.The FOMC decision was the panel’s second-straight unanimous vote.Following three cuts in 2019, U.S. central bankers have said their policy is supporting the country’s record expansion despite headwinds from trade and geopolitical uncertainty.Nonfarm payroll growth averaged 176,000 a month last year, while the unemployment rate held below 4 per cent for most of the year.Data since the December FOMC meeting have shown the housing market has held up, fuelled in part by last year’s rate cuts. Consumers also remain upbeat about their prospects, surveys have shown.Manufacturing, however, has showed scant improvement, consistent with a downshift in investment and sluggish markets for exports.Business investment could be further dented by Boeing Co.’s suspension of 737 Max production starting in January.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It’s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.“It is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,” Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. “On the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.”The remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada’s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation’s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy’s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.On trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.“We are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,” said Poloz. “In this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.”Outside of trade, Poloz said the country’s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation’s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation’s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn’t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"

Forecasters see it benefiting from an improving global economic outlook and fading political tensions.Betting on euro gains is among Morgan Stanley’s top trades for the new year, a view shared by analysts at UBS Wealth Management and Credit Agricole, among others. Options markets also signal improved confidence in the common currency, which touched a one-week high Friday as broad risk sentiment picked up on signs of improving U.S.-China trade relations.“Euro-dollar is particularly sensitive to global growth upgrades,” said Stephen Innes, strategist at Axitrader Limited. “With trade optimism swinging positively for global growth, the euro’s trend-following dynamics could start to argue for a push above.”The euro climbed as high as $1.1150 Friday, its strongest since Dec. 18. The Bloomberg survey predicts the shared currency will end 2020 at $1.16. It is down by around 3% this year, after a 4.5% loss in 2018.One-year risk reversals on the pair were at 36 basis points in favor of call options, close to a 20-month high of 43 reached on Dec. 13. The one-month measure, which covers the next European Central Bank decision on Jan. 23, was at 20 basis points.The euro wrong-footed markets this year by falling against a surprisingly resilient dollar, when it was forecast to rally around 5%. Fears that the U.S.-led tariff war with China could spread to Europe, concerns around Brexit and an overall subdued outlook for the global economy weighed on the shared currency. While Danske Bank’s Jens Peter Sorensen also sees the euro “slowly move” toward $1.15 by the end of 2020, he cautions on being overly optimistic amid accommodative ECB monetary policies.“We have a fairly benign view on the euro with it range-trading in the first quarter versus the dollar,” Sorensen, Danske’s chief analyst, said. “Even though we have the first steps toward both a trade deal and an orderly Brexit as well as some signs of a stabilization in the global economy, this fragile recovery needs plenty of stimulus. especially in Europe.”What to Watch:U.S. fixed income markets close early at 14:00 EST on Dec. 31; most global markets closed on Jan. 1 for New Year’s DayU.S. Fed’s FOMC minutes released Jan. 3Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly participate on a panel discussing global economic outlook (Jan. 3)Economic releases include:U.S. wholesale inventories, pending home sales, MNI Chicago PMI, Spain GDP, CPI (Dec. 30); U.S. FHFA house price index, consumer confidence, China manufacturing/non-manufacturing PMI (Dec. 31); U.S. jobless claims, Markit PMI manufacturing for countries/regions including Canada, U.S., Germany, Euro-area, U.K. (Jan. 2); U.S. construction spending, ISM manufacturing, France CPI, Germany unemployment, CPI, U.K. consumer credit (Jan. 3) Bloomberg.com"

 BNN Bloomberg Commentator Andrew McCreath takes a look at the Canadian jobs report, and why the significant losses will put pressure on Stephen Poloz and the BoC at the next interest rate meeting.   
 
 Key Insights 
 • The weakness in November’s report contrasts with the Bank of Canada’s view in the rate decision this week that a healthy labour market will fuel consumption and remain a source of resilience amid trade tensions 
 • A question now is whether or not the labour market will continue to cool down from a strong year or if it will reverse course 
 • Some of the losses in the month were in public administration, which saw a pickup last month due to election-related hiring 
 • Wages for permanent employees rose 4.4 per cent on the year, matching the prior month’s rate; hours worked slowed to 0.2 per cent, from a year earlier, versus 1.3 per cent in October 
 Get More 
 • Private sector employment was responsible for a majority of the job losses while self-employment and public-sector employment were little changed 
• November saw fewer workers of core-aged men and women 55 and over

So far in 2019, there have been 102,023 consumer insolvencies, the second-most for the first nine months of a year in records dating back to 1987.While the increases are coming from low levels, the trend is a worrying development that suggests cracks are starting to appear in Canada’s household debt landscape, at least for the most extended individuals. That would be all the more concerning, since it could foreshadow pressure on the country’s financial system. And it’s a bit of a puzzle, given the economic backdrop has been positive, including an unemployment rate that’s dropped to historically low levels.“Normally there’s a story you can tell, like there’s some underlying weakness that shows up with a bit of a lag in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies,” said Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Université Laval in Quebec City. “It’s just hard to see that now. It’s perplexing.”Insolvencies are accelerating at a pace that’s been associated with periods of distress: the start of the 2008-09 financial crisis, immediately before the 1990-92 recession, and during the period of pronounced economic weakness in 1995-96 that was tied to the Mexican peso crisis.The significance of the latest data is open to debate. For one thing, the insolvency numbers are at odds with other indicators that show a more benign environment for household debt. For instance, mortgage arrears were 0.23 per cent nationally at the end of July, close to the lowest they’ve ever been, and delinquency rates on non-mortgage debt remain subdued.It's perplexingIn addition, a strong labour market, rising wages, interest rates that are lower than they were at the start of the year and a recovery in home prices all suggest borrowers should have more breathing room, not less.It’s “hard to square” the jump in insolvencies with that backdrop, according to David Tulk, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. “Maybe it isn’t a trend that would represent the average borrower, but is instead catching the fringe that have over-extended themselves,” he said in an email.That’s not to say he’s downplaying the insolvency numbers, but rather they confirm his prior concerns about Canadian households. “What I worry about more is that households use the retrenchment in rates to add even more leverage, and then we get an employment shock,” he said.Brett House is more sanguine. While the latest surge in filings is “a bit concerning” given low unemployment and low interest rates, the deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto said “there are a number of important factors that temper the implications of the September print.”For one thing, the share of insolvencies to the total amount of household debt is falling. There were 5.3 filings for every $1 billion ($760 million) in total household debt as of September, versus 17.8 in 1997.Adjusting for population growth, the numbers also looks less dramatic. For instance, some 0.06 per cent of the Canadian workforce filed for insolvency, based on September numbers, versus 0.09 per cent a decade ago — though the rate has moved higher over the past 20 years.Tulk said he won’t read too much into one month’s worth of insolvency data. But if next month’s print shows a further increase and if things look shaky elsewhere, “I will be sufficiently nervy,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The next day, his Quebec counterpart Eric Girard will raise the province’s economic growth forecasts and announce plans for a sixth straight year of balanced books.The country’s two largest provincial economies are updating their budget outlooks one week after Alberta said it would cut spending and increase taxes in an effort to wrestle down a budget deficit ravaged by a slump in oil prices. Premier Jason Kenney has floated the idea of re-negotiating equalization payments that funnel tax revenue between the provinces via the federal government to help Alberta cope.“It plays in some way into the frustration” in Alberta, said Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Credit Union Central Alberta in Calgary. “The current economic situation seems to be forgotten by the rest of the country.”Tax collections in the two provinces, which account for about 57 per cent of the country’s economy, have been supported by booming job markets which have driven Ontario’s unemployment rate down to 5.3 per cent and Quebec’s to 4.8 per cent. In contrast, Alberta’s jobless rate runs at 6.6 per cent and Kenney plans to cut the government’s operating expenditures by 2.8 per cent and its public sector workforce by 7.7 per cent to reduce the budget deficit to $5.9 billion next fiscal year from $8.7 billion this year.Ontario’s budget shortfall for the year ending March 31 will be smaller than the $10.3 billion projected, said Phillips in October. Quebec will boost its 1.8 per cent growth forecast for this year, Girard said at a Bloomberg conference in October. Economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank see growth of 2.5 per cent for Quebec.The current economic situation seems to be forgotten by the rest of the countryThe extra yield investors demand to hold Alberta’s 10-year bonds instead of Ontario’s widened to around 11 basis points on Tuesday compared with a recent low of 6 basis points on May 17, according to Bloomberg Valuation prices. Quebec yields are lower by around 2 basis points along the curve for any duration shorter than 15 years.Even as Quebec and Ontario have consistently outperformed Alberta’s economy during the last four years, Alberta hasn’t received anything under the equalization system, because its traditionally had higher income per capita. Quebec has received almost US$46 billion in the last four years, and Ontario received about US$4.7 billion, according to government data.The equalization boost is helping Quebec to balance its books and even set aside some cash under its so-called Generations Fund to help repay existing debt. It also helped Ontario — though to a lesser extent, to deal with its deficits.The situation is fuelling resentment in Alberta which has seen thousands of job losses, and an exit of foreign capital during the oil slump.“Equalization payments are a big part of what keeps Quebec on balance,” said Randall Malcolm, senior managing director of fixed income at Sun Life Investment Management. “When you think about equalization payments coming over and Quebec running a generations fund, which part of it is essentially run as a hedge fund, it does seems a little strange.”Bloomberg.com"

Three-month bill yields fell on the comments, while U.S. stocks pared losses and the dollar was higher.“I want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,” he said. “Neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy.”The Fed has cut interest rates twice this year to shelter the U.S. economy from weak global growth and trade-policy uncertainty. Traders in federal funds futures are betting that the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting from the current target range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.Powell was non-committal on what the Fed’s next move would be.“Looking ahead, policy is not on a preset course,” he said. “The next FOMC meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.”He said the actions that the Fed has already taken “are providing support for the outlook,” which remains favorable but faces risks, principally from global developments such as trade and Brexit.But he added, “we will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 per cent objective.”The economy has recently shown signs of slowing as weakness overseas has spread to the U.S. and moved from domestic manufacturing industries to services.The job market has also downshifted, even as unemployment has fallen to a half-century low of 3.5 per cent. Nonfarm payrolls grew by an average of 157,000 per month in the third quarter, compared with gains above 200,000 earlier in the expansion.Powell said that work done by the Fed mining private-sector data suggested the most recent job gains may ultimately be revised lower, but that the pace would still be above the level needed to hold unemployment steady.Money markets were roiled last month as a combination of corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury debt purchases temporarily sent short-term interest rates skyrocketing.The Fed announced last week that it will extend through October the ad hoc liquidity lifeline that it’s been offering to U.S. funding markets since then.“We will not hesitate to conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range,” Powell said.“As we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point, we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves,” he added. “That time is now upon us.”Bloomberg.com"

The layoffs have added to fears that a weakened manufacturing sector could tip the economy into recession — potentially playing a role in next year’s election especially in a swing state like Michigan.“It’s a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurt,” said Mike Luna, a warehouse worker and a chairman of United Auto Workers Local 652, which is made up of striking GM workers and many laid off supplier employees.Luna works at a Ryder Integrated Logistics warehouse, where about 500 workers have been laid off, leaving the semi-trailers in the parking lot. They are chock full of auto parts destined for one of two nearby GM plants: Hoods and painted body panels for Chevrolet Camaros; and hinges, hubcaps and exhaust systems for Cadillac sedans, Buick SUVs and Chevys.The automaker itself has already lost more than US$1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, according to one analyst estimate. GM’s bigger parts suppliers are losing as much as US$2 million a day by the same measurement. Workers at smaller parts makers across the U.S. are sending employees home.It's a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurtIn Michigan, parts workers furloughed by the walkout do not get strike pay and just this week began receiving state unemployment benefits that max out at US$342 a week — not enough for most of his co-workers to live on, Luna said. Striking workers at GM get even less from a UAW rainy day fund, just US$250 a week.In a letter to members dated Friday, Terry Dittes, the union’s vice president in charge of talks with GM, said “good progress” has been made negotiating issues such as health care and the treatment of temporary workers.The parties have moved closer to a deal but two sticking points remain. They are employee pension plans and shortening the length of time required for entry-level workers to earn top hourly pay of US$28, according to people familiar with the matter on Saturday.The strike comes at a potential inflection point for America’s economy. New statistics last week showed a sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing in September.The GM strike isn’t helping. It’s chopped US$400 million in direct wages out of the U.S. economy, with half of that loss coming in Michigan, Patrick Anderson, chief executive officer of Anderson Economic Group in Lansing, estimated. The U.S. Treasury has lost US$154 million so far just in payroll and income taxes.In the southeast Michigan economy, a factory-heavy region, the layoffs have shaved off 1.8 per cent of earned income, he said. If that trend lasts for a quarter, “the chances of southeast Michigan going into a recession are pretty high,” Anderson said in an interview.The impact stretches beyond Michigan. Canadian components maker Linamar Corp., which makes metal parts for drivetrains like camshafts and transmission cases, said Wednesday the sudden drop in GM orders is costing it up to one million Canadian dollars (US$750,000) a day in lost revenue. Shares of the supplier slid as much as 13.8 per cent Thursday to a six-year low.The walkout has forced American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. to lay off workers at its largest driveline plant in the U.S. The company, which was spun off from GM in 1994, still relies on the automaker for 39 per cent of its revenue. CEO David Dauch told Bloomberg last week his company may adjust its full-year earnings outlook if the strike continues for “an extended period of time.” Its stock has fallen 18 per cent since the labour action began on Sept. 16.The strike is costing Axle and Lear Corp., another big supplier, US$2 million a day each while the toll on parts-maker Tenneco Inc. is US$1 million daily, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.GM and its suppliers can make up some production once the strike ends, but not all of it. So some profit will either be lost or shifted to next year.“We are getting to the point where it will be difficult to recover the lost production this year,” Spak wrote in a research note. “In some respects, that makes the remainder of 2019 somewhat of a throwaway for the group and could shift the focus to 2020.”From the union’s perspective, GM turned out record profits over the life of the expired four-year deal and CEO Mary Barra made more than US$66 million. It wants a pay raise, especially for newer employees who start at less than US$20 an hour, and a clear path for temporary workers to become full-timers making US$30 an hour.GM is looking to hold costs down, arguing that its current total compensation package of US$63 an hour is already more than that offered by Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler and the Japanese plants in the U.S.While the two sides wrestle over those and a few other issues, furloughed parts workers struggle to make do. At Ryder and most of the smaller suppliers, workers make around US$15 an hour. Union leader Luna said he cautioned workers a year ago to save for the strike. But at that wage, which equates to US$31,000 a year without overtime, many workers live check to check.Some employees have gone to the United Way and other charities for help with buying food and other essentials, he said. A few have applied for new jobs, but that’s a tough sell.“They are trying to get work,” Luna said, “but then you have to tell an employer that when the strike ends, you would go back.”Bloomberg.com"

The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its interest rate to a record low and said it may ease further.There can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptionsAlthough a measure of Chinese manufacturing improved, the overall tone was of the world economy failing to rebound from the slowdown that has plagued it for the whole of this year amid mounting trade tensions. That leaves the U.S. and China under pressure to resolve their differences as well central bankers and governments to find ways to support demand.“There can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptions,” Fitch Chief Economist Brian Coulton said.The WTO cut its 2019 trade growth forecast by more than half to 1.2 per cent, and warned that further rounds of tariffs could spark a “destructive cycle of recrimination.”UBS Group AG economists reckon global expansion is tracking just 2.3 per cent at the moment, almost a percentage point less than the start of the third quarter. Those at Danske Bank are warning there is a 30 per cent chance of a global recession in the next two years.While global trade tensions are part of the story, there’s also industry specific issues — autos in Germany, semiconductors in South Korea — adding to the hurdles.German car-parts giant Continental AG last month laid out a sweeping restructuring plan that could affect as many as 20,000 jobs worldwide. Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries cut its forecasts, citing sales to chipmakers.Central banks around the world are fighting the slowdown with rate cuts and monetary stimulus. But they are also ramping up calls on governments to jump in too with fiscal measures, saying they can’t do all the heavy lifting.In the meantime, global bond investors are betting against a meaningful inflation pickup. Even with sovereign yields below zero, they are still piling into government debt, and so-called deflation trades are on the rise. Germany’s 10-year borrowing costs are at minus 0.5 per cent.The latest Purchasing Managers Indexes may reinforce those views. German manufacturers cut prices in September by the most in more than three years. In Japan, where manufacturing sentiment is declining, factories lowered selling prices for a fourth straight month. British companies warned of “Brexit uncertainty and clients routing supply chains away from the U.K.”Such an environment is worrying for central bankers with inflation already low and well short of targets. Consumer-price growth in Germany and the euro area slipped below 1 per cent in September for the first time since 2016. For the latter, that’s far short of the European Central Bank’s goal.In the U.K., the PMI reading improved, but still remained below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.China’s numbers were mixed. The Caixin/IHS Markit measure to 51.4 in September from 50.4 in August. The nation’s official PMI was less upbeat — edging up to 49.8 from 49.5.Parts of the global economy still show resilience. Services are growing, and falling unemployment is supporting consumer spending. U.S.-China trade negotiations remain a critical risk for the outlook, with a Chinese delegation set to visit Washington for further talks this month aimed at hammering out a deal.“We would hear a great sigh of relief form central banks around the world if the trade situation were to be somewhat resolved,” Holger Schmieding, Berenberg Bank chief economist, said on Bloomberg Television. “I’d be positively surprised if we had a lasting resolution within the next few months. Both sides want a deal, but they still seem far apart.” Bloomberg.com"

Switchboard operators were done in by the dawn of direct dialling. And in the car industry, auto workers are deathly afraid the engine assembler will give way to battery builders.Dread over the prospect that plug-in cars — which have fewer parts and require less labour to build — will doom auto jobs helped spark the first United Auto Workers strike against General Motors Co. in over a decade. Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which are rolling their own battery-powered models to market in the coming years, could face a similar fate if they’re unable to quell the UAW’s concerns that widespread adoption of EVs endangers the employment of 35,000 union members.“There’s a potential for our jobs to be gone — they don’t need us anymore,” said Tim Walbolt, president of the UAW local representing workers at a Fiat Chrysler transmission components plant near Toledo, Ohio. “It scares us.”For all the buzz generated by Tesla Inc., the EV era is still in its infancy, with zero-emission autos having reached just 2 per cent of global production. GM has extended the UAW an offer to get in on the ground floor, pitching a new battery plant staffed by dues-paying union members in an Ohio town jarred by job loss. But the overture came with a catch: GM wants to pay the workers less, and the facility is unlikely to need as many staff as an engine or transmission factory would.A recent study of electric-vehicle production in Europe by consultant AlixPartners found that it took 40 per cent fewer hours to assemble an electric motor and battery than a traditional internal-combustion engine and transmission.“It’s a bad news story from a labour perspective,” said Mark Wakefield, the head of AlixPartners’s automotive practice. “You would just fundamentally need less people.”Perversely, GM also arguably has uncertainty on it’s side at the bargaining table. It’s going to want concessions to cushion itself against the risk that consumer adoption of electric autos remains slow. The carmaker isn’t fully utilizing the factory that builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV north of Detroit, and tepid demand for the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt put the future of the factory that assembles it in nearby Hamtramck in doubt.The collision with carmakers over electrification is one the UAW saw coming.“Electric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membership,” Jennifer Kelly, the union’s research director, said during a collective-bargaining conference in Detroit earlier this year.It’s almost certain to carry over from the UAW’s talks with GM to negotiations with Detroit’s other automakers. Ford has estimated electric cars will require 30 per cent fewer hours of labor per vehicle and 50 per cent less factory floor space.“Rationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s automotive president, told investors on an earnings call in April.Electric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membershipEven Fiat Chrysler, a laggard with regard to electrification, has stoked fear at union halls linked to internal-combustion components plants, where rumours are flying that the company plans to outsource work to lower-paying suppliers.“We cannot help but feel like the left behind stepchildren of the UAW,” Mike Booth, the president of the union’s local in Marysville, Michigan, wrote in a letter to the labour group’s Chrysler council last month. He and other UAW leaders fear that German mega-supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which took over operation of a Chrysler axle plant in 2008, will take work away from the automaker’s machining facility near Toledo and a transmission and castings complex in Kokomo, Indiana.A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said the operations the union are concerned about are critical to the business. ZF will continue to work with the UAW in Marysville, and an arrangement in which Fiat Chrysler licenses technology from the supplier in Kokomo may be creating some confusion, a spokesman said. He declined to comment on Toledo.In August, GM shut down a transmission plant outside Detroit, affecting more than 260 workers as part of a larger restructuring. That may foreshadow other closures as EV production ramps up. The supply chain is where the job risk is greatest, especially for workers employed making engines, transmissions and sub-components that aren’t needed in EVs.Consultant IHS Markit predicts the introduction of new gas-powered engine families will drop to zero in 2022, from nearly 70 in 2011, as automakers shift spending to electric propulsion. The market for a whole range of parts used in internal combustion vehicles — such as axles, mufflers, fuel tanks and transmissions — will shrink in a range from 6 per cent to 20 per cent by 2025, according to a study by Deloitte Consulting.“The value chain is shifting and companies and their unions are going to have to figure out how to change themselves or risk becoming part of a shrinking bubble,” said Neal Ganguli, head of the auto supply base group at Deloitte’s U.S. automotive practice.That’s a problem because engines and transmissions currently account for just under half of automaker manufacturing capacity, Credit Suisse auto analyst Dan Levy estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors. As a result, automakers may face labour, social and political challenges as they transition to EVs, he wrote.GM’s EV factory in Lake Orion, Michigan, offers a window into what the UAW is worried about.While the plant is unionized, the automaker staffs it in part with lower-wage employees under a special contract. What’s more, 64 per cent of the fully electric Bolt model’s content is made in Korea, including the battery.One of the biggest suppliers is Seoul-based LG Chem Ltd., which makes cells in South Korea and assembles packs for GM and Fiat Chrysler at a non-union plant in western Michigan with a starting wage for technicians of US$16 an hour.The UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they'll have a rough timeThat’s close to what Ford pays its entry-level temporary workers, but far below the US$28 to US$30 an hour for legacy UAW employees. Temp workers at Ford’s engine and transmission plants also can move up into legacy wage brackets, which isn’t the case at LG’s facility.“The move to electric could weaken the union further,” Joshua Murray, a labour expert and assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University. “Certainly, the UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they’ll have a rough time.”No major automaker entirely outsources engines, in no small part thanks to displacement and horsepower being the source of marketing buzz and bragging rights for decades. EVs are a different story — even Tesla relies heavily on Japan’s Panasonic Corp. in the making of its battery packs.Batteries — the single most expensive part of an electric vehicle — are almost exclusively manufactured overseas and mostly by companies relatively new to the automotive powertrain, such as China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and South Korea’s SK Innovation Co.SK Innovation broke ground earlier this year on a new battery factory outside of Atlanta, which will employ some 2,000 non-union workers. And CEO Jun Kim thinks carmakers will have a tough time replicating what his company does.“There is a difference between the DNA of automakers and battery makers such as us,” Kim said in a March interview. “There are only a handful of battery suppliers that are capable of delivering high-quality products while guaranteeing cost competitiveness.”Bloomberg.com"

Currently, the basic personal deduction is $12,069. The increase would be phased in, reaching $15,000 by 2023, the party said in a statement Sunday.“I’ve been talking to Canadians across the country and I keep hearing the same thing: even with our strong economy and record unemployment, it’s still tough to make ends meet,” Trudeau said.This measure alone will lift about 40,000 Canadians out of poverty, according to the party, as the “average family” saves $585 per year. It’s also expected to cost an annual $5.6 billion by the time it’s fully implemented, and paid for by soon-to-be-announced “measures that make our tax system fairer for Canadians,” the Liberals said. If re-elected, the Liberals would also seek to reduce the cost of wireless services by 25 per cent within four years, according to the statement. To do that, they will work with telecom companies to offer plans at globally comparable prices, encourage competition and allow regulators to step in if that competition isn’t leading to lower prices. They also plan to award new wireless spectrum on the basis of consumer choice and affordability, and not simply the highest bids.“Cell phone bills in particular put a lot of pressure on a family’s budget, with Canadians paying up to twice as much for wireless services than people in other G7 countries,” the party said in the statement.Bloomberg.com"

The only other months with negative returns over the same period were October, June and January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Don’t write off September just yet though, as the month has had its share of gains. The index has risen six of the last 10 Septembers, though massive declines in 2011, 2014 and 2015 pushed the average lower.Investors can be forgiven for wanting to see August behind them. Global trade tensions roiled markets throughout the month, leading to wild swings amid the China-U.S. showdown. After all the noise however, the benchmark climbed 0.2 per cent for the month, after the best weekly gain since January as energy and mining stocks rallied with commodities.Further along the Canadian equity train ride, the next stop is ‘Hobnob Station.’Investors will head to conferences in Toronto and New York to hear from senior executives of major Canadian companies about their growth plans and the state of their industries. There will also be plenty of time for dinners, drinks and one-on-one meetings.In Toronto, two events stand out:Scotiabank Financials Summit (Sept. 4-5): Presenters include C-Suite executives of the Big Six banks, life insurers like Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., and private equity firm Onex Corp.Toronto Global Forum (Sept. 4-6): Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci — who has set up a political action committee in a bid to prevent Donald Trump’s re-election — will speak along with the CEOs of various Canadian corporations and Canadian provincial and federal ministers.For Manhattan, investors are set to gather at the Sheraton Times Square Hotel for Barclays’ annual CEO Energy-Power conference, where majors like Suncor Energy Inc. will make presentations.There’s one major event that will have economists and market participants on edge: Bank of Canada’s rate decision day on Sept. 4. While most expect no rate change, Governor Stephen Poloz’s comments on monetary policy will be watched closely, especially after GDP expanded 3.7 per cent in the second quarter, beating the 3 per cent estimate. Investors are betting on a rate cut in October, based on trading in the swaps market.Here’s a recap of what happened last week.Canada recorded its largest inflow of foreign direct investment in four years, another sign global trade tensions haven’t reduced the appetite for investing into the Canadian economy.

Additionally, Hudson’s Bay will take a stake in Le Tote and get two seats on the board. That stake will be 25 per cent, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because that detail hasn’t been made public.Le Tote will operate 38 Lord & Taylor stores, according to the statement. Another five are set to shut down, according to the person. Previous closures of the chain have included the flagship Manhattan location. The San Francisco-based company said it will extend employment offers to “the vast majority” of Lord & Taylor employees.The statement confirms an earlier report by Bloomberg News.The deal gives the Canadian retailer a way to divest operations of the struggling Lord & Taylor chain while holding onto the more valuable asset — the real estate on which the stores are located. It also lets Hudson’s Bay focus on better-performing units such as Saks Fifth Avenue. However, Hudson’s Bay will still be responsible for making Lord & Taylor’s rent payments for at least three years, which it estimates at about $77 million (US$57.9 million) per year.The transaction, expected to close at the start of the 2019 holiday season, gives Hudson’s Bay some measure of flexibility in the future: Starting in 2021, both companies will have options to reassess the store network. Hudson’s Bay could then look into redeveloping some properties, including for mixed use.The move is Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes’s latest attempt to turn around the company, after selling flash-sale e-commerce site Gilt and cashing out of European operations. The deal brings together “fashion rental subscriptions with traditional retail,” she said in the statement.Meanwhile, the company is also mulling an offer by company Chairman Richard Baker and his partners, who collectively own about 57 per cent of Hudson’s Bay, to take the company private.Hudson’s Bay shares are up 39 per cent this year, largely related to Baker’s offer.Le Tote, based in San Francisco, was founded in 2012 and is backed by firms that include Lerer Hippeau, Azure Capital and Simon Ventures. The company offers monthly boxes of apparel items that users can purchase or return after use. The company is in the process of securing financing for the full purchase price, according to the statement.Lord & Taylor generated $1.4 billion of revenue in fiscal 2018, Hudson’s Bay said.

For Houston-based Kinder, the deal completes an exit from a country that has frustrated more than a few companies — from ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to Marathon Oil Corp.The drumbeat of exits, rare for such a stable oil-producing country, adds an extra layer of gloom for an industry that accounts for about a fifth of Canada’s exports. The energy sector — centred around Alberta’s oilsands — has struggled to rebound since the 2014 crash in global oil prices, with capital spending declining for five straight years and job cuts pushing the province’s unemployment rate above 6 per cent. Alberta is forecast to post the slowest growth of any region in Canada this year.The situation isn’t likely to improve any time soon, with key pipelines like TC Energy Corp.’s Keystone XL and Enbridge Inc.’s expansion of its Line 3 conduit bogged down by legal challenges. The lack of pipelines has weighed on Canadian heavy crude prices for years, sending them to a record low late in 2018.“If they thought things were getting better in Canada, they might hold on, but they don’t see things getting better,” Laura Lau, who helps manage more than $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. “The pipeline situation is getting worse; everything is getting worse.”Other recent major exits include ConocoPhillips’ US$13.2 billion sale of its oilsands and natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc. in 2017, and Shell’s and Marathon’s sales of their stakes in an oil-sands project to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for about US$10.7 billion that same year. Canadian Natural also bought Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp.’s Canadian heavy oil assets this year for US$2.79 billion. Norway’s Equinor ASA pulled out in 2016 after facing pressure at home to invest in lower-emission projects.The pipeline situation is getting worse; everything is getting worseWhile a government curtailment program has boosted oilsands prices to more normal levels, the system has prevented companies from investing in new deposits. What’s more, the oilsands are often viewed by investors as a higher-cost jurisdiction that produces a lower quality of heavy crude. Those persistent drags are likely to keep Canadian assets at the top of international companies’ lists for potential disposal, Lau said.Kinder Morgan is in many ways the perfect example of the troubles — including slow-moving regulatory processes, an active environmental movement, and a variety of inter-provincial squabbles. The company bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries crude and other products from Edmonton to a shipping terminal in Vancouver, for about US$5.6 billion in 2005 in a bid to gain exposure to the oilsands — the world’s third-largest crude reserves.But a plan to roughly triple the capacity of the line got bogged down amid opposition from indigenous groups, environmentalists and British Columbia’s government. Kinder threatened to scrap the expansion, which all but forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to step in and buy the entire line for about US$3.45 billion last year.“When they sold Trans Mountain, there wasn’t much left, and it was just a matter of time for them to exit Canada completely,” Lau said. “But definitely another foreign company exiting Canada doesn’t send a good signal.”Not all foreign operators have abandoned Canada. Exxon Mobil Corp. still has a sizable presence with its controlling stake in Imperial Oil Ltd., a $25-billion company. Shell, based in The Hague, still owns a refining complex and natural gas production in Alberta and British Columbia. France’s Total SA owns a portion of the Fort Hills mine, and Japanese and Chinese companies also have oilsands projects.A potential catalyst for the sector could be the election of a Conservative government in Canada’s federal election in October, said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial. That may change global investors’ perceptions about the support the industry would receive from the government.“The silver lining in this whole process is that Canada owns Canada again, and we got it pretty cheap,” Tahmazian said in an interview. “Now the question is can we take advantage of that by allowing ourselves a more friendly environment for foreign investment?”Bloomberg.com"

One rate cut by December is fully priced, as is one more cut by June next year. That may not be quick enough, especially with the country’s yield curve inverting to the point that historically has presaged central bank easing, Doyle said.“In the event that we are heading into a global recession and things turn ugly and you get rising unemployment rates globally, then Canada is going to have to ease, maybe even more than the U.S.,” Doyle said in a telephone interview.Macquarie is assigning a more than 50 per cent chance of a cut in September, plus another cut in October.Scotiabank also revised its rate outlook last Friday, predicting one rate cut this year from the Bank of Canada no later than at its Oct. 30 decision, and as early as Sept. 4. A second cut would come early in 2020. It based the revision on the view the U.S.-China trade war will persist through Donald Trump’s presidency.“Risks to the Canadian economy are on the rise,” Jean-François Perrault, Scotiabank’s chief economist, said in a note to clients. “Dependent as it is on international trade, Canada cannot be immune to the rising tide of protectionism.”Perrault is more sanguine about the domestic outlook than Doyle. He believes Canadian economic conditions don’t warrant rate cuts, but the heightened global uncertainty requires a cautious tone.“We now believe the Bank of Canada will follow those that cut rates to insure against potential damage,” Perrault said.Economists and markets have been expecting fewer moves, and a slower pace of cutting from Canada, for a number of reasons. The nation’s economy probably grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms, unlike the U.S., and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank’s target.Risks to the Canadian economy are on the riseBut historically it’s also rare for Canada to be so out of sync with the Fed, which has already cut its policy rate once and is seen moving again three more times over the next six months.As of Aug. 16, implied odds based on cash forward rates show investors are pricing in 37 basis points of easing over the next six months for the Bank of Canada, versus 81 points for the Fed. The discrepancy in expectations for Canadian and U.S. policy moves has been averaging the widest since 2010.Regardless, Doyle expects the domestic economic data to make a turn for the worse in the next few months. Inflation pressures are likely to moderate, particularly as mortgage costs fall, business investment looks uncertain, and inventories have built up to recession-era levels, all of which point to a softer second half for the Canadian economy, Doyle said in a recent research report.Bloomberg.com"
97,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Christopher Condon,"Fed looks locked in for quarter-point cut, but there may be drama",Unclear what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing,,,,,2019-07-31,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-looks-locked-in-for-quarter-point-cut-decision-day-guide?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jerome-powell.jpg,"The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by a quarter-point at its meeting that concludes Wednesday and leave the option open for additional moves despite demands by President Donald Trump for a “large” rate cut.“We may get a dissent or two, but it seems like a 25-basis-point cut is pretty much locked in,” said Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York.The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. after the two-day meeting concludes and Chairman Jerome Powell will brief reporters 30 minutes later.The immediate outlook for policy has been made crystal clear thanks to a communications flub by New York Fed President John Williams in a July 18 speech.Odds for a half-point cut rose after he recommended swift policy action if the economy weakens when rates are low, but fell back after the bank later clarified that he was not discussing upcoming policy moves. Trump weighed in on Williams’s remarks, saying a day later that he liked his first statement much more than his second.The meeting still contains drama. It’s unclear how much opposition even a quarter-point cut will face within the FOMC, or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing.Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U.S. economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond.“For a lot of them, 25 will feel like a down payment,” said William English, a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist. “But I think they’ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time.”“Uncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well-telegraphed rate cut looming at present. Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing.”— Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg economistsBefore Williams spoke on July 18, investors were pricing in a quarter-point cut. Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation. Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a “risk management” approach.In his remarks, Williams reviewed his long-standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero. Investors took it as a signal that a half-point move might be on the table, until the New York Fed issued the clarification.That steer, combined with a solid — though not spectacular — report on second-quarter economic growth, reduced the chances of a half-point cut to “almost zero,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago.The data showed the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.1 per cent, slower than the first quarter but above the 1.8 per cent expected by economists.Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all. That group includes two current FOMC voters, Kansas City’s Esther George and Boston’s Eric Rosengren, so resistance could spur two dissents. The meeting’s minutes will be released on Aug. 21, providing a fuller picture of any divide, and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime.Several economists expect the committee’s post-meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.” That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter-point cut as early as September, without committing the Fed to such a move.“The intention is likely to do another 25, but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York.Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations. Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news. Since the Fed last met, the U.S. and China have returned to the trade negotiating table, and fresh U.S. employment and spending numbers have come in strong.“That’s a tricky issue for him,” said English. “Since June, the data’s been pretty good.”He may also get questions on whether the Fed would join the U.S. government in intervening to weaken the dollar to aid U.S. exports after Trump told reporters last week that he had not ruled it out.Financial markets will also watch for an early end to the runoff of securities from the Fed’s balance sheet. That process, scheduled to conclude at the end of September, modestly tightens policy by removing downward pressure on long-term bond yields.Economists were divided on whether officials will want to halt the runoffs when they cut interest rates. Few saw an immediate cessation as likely, but some said it would simplify communications about the direction of monetary policy.“The markets won’t be affected either way, but it’s a cleaner message” if the Fed halts the runoffs, Coronado said.Bloomberg.com"
99,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Carolynn Look,"The world of monetary policy, according to Christine Lagarde","Her views on central-banking issues fall in line with the ECB's — that is, with at least one exception",,,,,2019-07-03,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-world-of-monetary-policy-according-to-christine-lagarde,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/aafp_1i98bb.jpg,"Governments hoping their nominee for European Central Bank president will keep a steady hand on euro-zone monetary policy can probably take heart from Christine Lagarde’s public views.Lagarde, a lawyer and former politician rather than an economist, has frequently commented on central-banking issues since becoming head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011. AsCentral guardian of the world’s second-biggest currency area from Nov. 1, giving press conferences after each ECB policy meeting, her opinions will be key even if she leans on colleagues such as Philip Lane to craft detailed plans.For the European Union leaders who nominated her, a smooth transition from Mario Draghi is key — Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that “we have someone who gives guarantees that they won’t constitute a rupture” with the current president’s strategy.Here is a selection of what Lagarde has said about the central bank’s actions and challenges:Outright Monetary TransactionsDraghi’s flagship tool for fighting the euro-zone debt crisis has never been used but it’s still critical that the incoming chief backs it. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann’s opposition to the bond-buying program known as OMT may have scuttled his own shot at the top job. Lagarde was in the audience when Draghi pledged in 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, and spoke in favor of OMT after the program was announced weeks later.“Many of the right decisions have been taken. Most recently, initiatives by major central banks — the European Central Bank’s OMT bond-purchasing program, QE3 by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan’s expanded Asset Purchase Program — are big policy signals in the right direction.” — Sept. 24, 2012, Washington DCNegative Interest RatesShortly after the BOJ followed the ECB in adopting a negative interest rate in 2016, Lagarde praised the tool while saying more time is needed to assess its side effects. That’s an issue on the Governing Council’s agenda now as officials consider whether to cut rates further and keep them below zero for longer.While banks complain that negative rates — effectively a charge on their overnight reserves — hurt profitability, the ECB says that’s outweighed by the boost to the economy. Lagarde thought so as well.“If we had not had those negative rates, we would be in a much worse place today, with inflation probably lower than where it is, with growth probably lower than where we have it.” — March 18, 2016, Ho Chi Minh CityQuantitative EasingDraghi had to fight hard against skeptics both outside and within the ECB’s Governing Council to launch his broad-based asset-purchase program. He finally announced it in January 2015, as the euro zone was teetering on the edge of deflation. Lagarde responded the same day.“We welcome the measures announced today that will strongly reinforce the ECB’s accommodative stance. The planned expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet will help lower borrowing cost across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation.” — Jan. 22, 2015, IMF statementFiscal SupportLagarde has demonstrated realism when it comes to central banks’ ability to counter the next downturn, backing the ECB’s repeated calls for governments to offer more support with better fiscal policies. She has urged nations to strike a better balance between growth, debt sustainability and social objectives.“Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, and should anchor expectations…. The reality is that many economies are not resilient enough. High public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will. For many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.” — April 2, 2019, WashingtonEuropean ReformsDraghi and his colleagues have also spent years urging governments to pursue structural reforms to bolster their economies, cries that have intensified as populist movements challenge European cohesion. Lagarde is on board with that as well, advocating flexible hiring practices, modernizing and harmonizing insolvency regimes, and spending more on innovation.“Our goal should be clear: Restarting convergence and ensuring the fruits of economic growth are shared broadly across the EU. This will help restore faith in the European project.” — Feb. 14, 2019, MunichFresh StimulusThe ECB and the Federal Reserve are expected to ease their monetary stances as soon as this summer in response to a global economic slowdown amid risks including U.S.-driven trade protectionism and Brexit. For that strategy, Lagarde has delivered praise, while again reminding governments that central bankers can’t do it alone.“These policy responses have provided vital support over the past few months.… When the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will, policy makers may need to use all policy tools to maximize their combined effect. This means supporting demand through decisive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus wherever possible.” — June 5, 2019, IMF blogRadical TheoryFinally, Lagarde has dipped into a topic that tends to make central bankers shudder — Modern Monetary Theory. Typically advocated as an argument for governments to worry less about budget deficits and use fiscal firepower to achieve full employment, monetary officials see it as poison to their independence. While Lagarde said MMT is no panacea, she didn’t reject it outright.“While it is tempting, when you look at the sort of mathematical modelling of it, and it seems to stand, there are big caveats about it, such as if the country is in a liquidity trap, such as if there is deflation. Well then, in those circumstances, it could possibly work for a short period of time probably, because interest rates stay low until such time when they start going up. And then it is a bit of a trap.” — April 11, 2019, IMF press conferenceBloomberg.com"

European governments turned to the 63-year old onetime lawyer and former French finance minister on Tuesday after hours of negotiations over a package of top EU jobs.In moving from Washington to Frankfurt, Lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19-nation economy which Draghi has already signalled will need more help, likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing. Inflation is running at barely half the ECB’s goal of just under 2 per cent despite years of negative rates and 2.6 trillion euros (US$3 trillion) of bond purchases.Investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis-fighter, Lagarde will share Draghi’s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy, especially as her appointment means the more hawkish Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann misses out. Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Morgan Stanley said the choice of Lagarde increases their “conviction” that the ECB will eventually resume buying bonds.Lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a “rough patch” and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response. In June 2014, she said she would “certainly hope” the ECB would conduct QE if inflation stayed sluggish — months before it announced it would do so.She also praised Draghi’s 2012 commitment to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns. In March, she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright Moliere: “The trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.”Just last September, Lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ECB, telling the Financial Times she was a ” bit annoyed and fed up” with the suggestion and that she was “not interested” in the role. Only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job, with Weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a tight race dominated by men.France has now twice secured the presidency of the two-decade-old ECB. Draghi, an Italian, was preceded by Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, who replaced Dutchman Wim Duisenberg.In common with Trichet, whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of Credit Lyonnais, Lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles. They culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi-million euro dispute linked to the same bank.Lagarde’s appointment also means the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve will be headed by former lawyers, a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as Ben Bernanke. That risks opening her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy.“She’s very political, she’s very wise, and I would assume she has the best economists that can help her with this,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment. “It is a little puzzling because she’s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there.”She does boast political nous though, which will be needed to unite fellow ECB officials when setting policy — especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy.“She has the political skills needed to build consensus on the Governing Council, is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ECB’s decisions on the larger European stage — though she may still face skepticism in Germany,” said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. “She would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space.”EU Council President Donald Tusk dismissed concerns about Lagarde’s lack of formal economic training. She will make a “perfect” ECB president, he said in Brussels.Alongside Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Lagarde will be one of two women on the six-member Executive Board. They are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25-member Governing Council, which includes the governors of euro-region national central banks and has long been dominated by men.Lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the IMF, being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016. She will now leave more than 1 1/2 years before that is due to end, likely sparking a fight between capitals over whether a European should always run the lender or if it’s time for an emerging-market candidate to do so.At the IMF, Lagarde helped negotiate the fund’s biggest ever bailout when it handed fresh aid last year to Argentina. She also sought to give emerging economies such as China more of a voice in its management, while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality. That helped broaden the fund’s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts.She sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set. As the leader of one of Greece’s major creditors, she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro-zone while at the same time persuading its European partners to allow debt relief. In 2018, she and Weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon Germany’s government to spend more and close its current account surplus.Lagarde was educated in France and the U.S., working as an intern in the U.S. Congress for a time. On graduating from the University of Paris, Nanterre, she joined the Paris office of Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. She focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions, rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999.Then-French President Jacques Chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade. She went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a Group of Seven economy in June 2007.She held that role as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro-area debt crisis. During the all-night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing M&M’s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs.“If it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today,” she once said.A past member of France’s synchronized swimming team, Lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to “grit your teeth and smile.”Bloomberg.com"

It emerged from bankruptcy just 10 months prior to two fires in June that closed down key gasoline-making units just as the summer driving season gears up.Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Wednesday the refinery will close within the next month. The complex produces 335,000 barrels a day, meeting about 3 per cent of gasoline demand in a densely populated region. Futures in New York jumped more than 5 per cent on a Reuters report Tuesday night that the refinery would close.PES will lay off half of its 640 union workers and 130 salaried employees Wednesday, said a person familiar with the plans.On Monday, the United Steelworkers union said any decision to shut the complex would have lasting consequences “starting with almost 2,000 workers directly employed by PES and tens of thousands more whose employment depends on the refinery to some degree,” according to a statement by USW International Vice President Tom Conway.PES officials will meet with Ryan O’Callaghan, president of USW Local 10-1 at noon local time, he said in an interview Wednesday. O’Callaghan, who represents 640 USW workers at the refinery, said he hadn’t been given prior warning of any plans to close.The refinery was beset by two fires, on June 10 and June 21. The most recent, affecting an alkylation unit used to make high-octane gasoline, was triggered by an explosion in the complex’s Girard Point section that could be seen miles away and was picked up by weather satellites. The earlier blaze was at a fluid catalytic cracker in the Point Breeze section of the refinery.The plant is the biggest of five refineries in the Northeast. It’s faced threats before. In 2012, with supply outpacing demand, it took a change of ownership and a push by lawmakers and unions to keep it operating.“That refinery plays a huge part in the gasoline market,” said Gene McGillian, vice president at Tradition Energy, a risk management firm in Stamford, Conn.The loss of the refinery will likely increase the region’s dependence on supplies from Canada, Europe and the Gulf Coast, potentially boosting prices for drivers and profit margins for the remaining plants in the area. Shares of PBF Energy Inc, which operates two refineries near Philadelphia, have surged 14 per cent since Thursday.“The U.S. Gulf Coast will remain a key supplier of refined products with supplemental gasoline imports from Europe likely needed to replenish lost production from the facility,” Marc Amons, senior research analyst, North America refining at Wood Mackenzie, said in an emailed statement.In 2012, the Philadelphia facility almost closed before being taken over by Energy Transfer Partners subsidiary Sunoco Inc. and the Carlyle Group. It emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August with the previous owners retaining smaller stakes.The fundamental problems that undercut the complex in 2012, though, largely remained.East Coast refiners aren’t on the receiving end of crude pipelines from America’s oil shale riches in Texas and North Dakota. So the only way they can get hold of U.S. crude is by train or U.S.-flagged tankers, which are much more expensive. The result: Philadelphia-area fuel makers still import crude from West Africa and the North Sea.PES used to take at least 200 rail cars a day of Bakken crude, but most of those barrels were diverted to the Midwest and Gulf Coast after pipeline expansions. Margins for processing imported crude sank in early June to the lowest in three years, according to Oil Analytics data. At the same time, refiners in the Midwest were threatening to encroach on part of the nearby western Pennsylvania market.Girard Point was already facing months of downtime as inspections continue to determine extent of damage from Friday’s explosions and fire.To permanently shut both Girard Point and the Point Breeze section “could take up to a year to fully secure the facility and removes the crude and products that remain in the process units and the storage tanks,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.Bloomberg.com"

The unemployment rate fell to 5.4 per cent, the lowest in data going back to 1976.Friday’s report reaffirms the labour market as the main driver of Canada’s expansion, and adds to a recent run of data showing clear signs the country is on the path back to growth after stalling at the end of last year. The currency jumped on the report, which is seen to give the central bank more ammunition to resist pressure to lower borrowing costs.The Canadian jobs report contrasts with weaker-than-expected payroll data in the U.S. that’s fuelling concern of a broader slowdown there and boosting calls for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.Canada’s report “was a good number with strong details, in contrast with pretty soft numbers in the U.S.,” Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank, said by phone from Toronto.“This suggests greater capacity for the Bank of Canada to stay on hold if the Fed does cut rates.” Economists forecast Canadian employment to rise by 5,000, after a record gain of 106,500 in April. Canada’s currency jumped 0.6 per cent to 75.30 US cents at 11:13 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on government 2-year bonds held steady at 1.38 per cent. The spread against U.S. Treasuries of equivalent maturity narrowed to 43 basis points, the tightest in more than a year.In Canada, all indications point to an economy growing at a much faster pace than it had in the final three months of last year and the beginning of 2019. Along with the jobs report, recent data show a strong rebound in output in March, signs of stabilization in housing and improving export numbers. Economists anticipate growth will accelerate to more than 2 per cent on an annualized basis in the second quarter.Canadian employment is now up 2.4 per cent from the same period in 2018, the largest year-over-year increase since before the 2008-2009 recession. The number of people unemployed is also the lowest in a decade. Over the past two years, Canada’s economy has added almost 700,000 new jobs.Three provinces relatively immune from the recent weakness in the oil sector — Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec — are mostly responsible for the growth in employment, as are service-related industries such as transportation, technology and professionals.Companies that have been hiring include Staples Canada, Canada Goose Holdings, Accenture, along with a surge in employment by technology companies.“One of the things that I suspect is happening there is that global technology companies that are by and large US-based, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons, etc., are hiring workers to a greater extent in this geography relative to the U.S.,” Neil Selfe, a founding partner at Infor Financial Group, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. That’s “because of the visa issues and the immigration issues of the Trump administration.”Canada has been able to produce strong job gains over the past two years largely because of a rapid increase in the labour force, on higher immigration and youth participation. The bigger risk in Canada is the labour force growth won’t be sustained and the market could tighten. For example, the labour force dropped by 49,200 in May, one of the largest one-month declines, after surging in recent months.As a result, rising demand for workers was met by tapping into the unemployed ranks. The number of people looking for work and unable to find it dropped by 76,900 in May, the biggest one-month decline since 1993.Another sign of tightening is that the recent acceleration in wage growth is holding. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.8 per cent in May, from 2.5 per cent in April, bringing it to the fastest since August last year. Pay gains for permanent employees were steady at 2.6 per cent.Bloomberg.com"
114,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Susanne Barton,Markets are more gloomy about our economy than the Bank of Canada — who’s right?,Some see the loonie falling below 74 cents after the central bank’s rate decision this week,,,,,2019-05-27,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/traders-worry-as-hopeful-bank-of-canada-officials-meet-this-week,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/poloz-5.jpg,"As the Bank of Canada meets this week amid trade-war chaos, a big unanswered question will loom over the gathering: Who’s right about the nation’s economic prospects, gloomy traders or optimistic policy makers?Markets are worried that Canada is deeply exposed to the U.S.-China trade spat. The Canadian yield curve is inverted, with three-month government debt yielding more than 10-year notes, suggesting fear the dispute will weigh on global growth. The rates market is pricing in 17 basis points of central bank easing through the next 12 months, according to trading of forward contracts.But the Bank of Canada has been resolute. Governor Stephen Poloz said May 17 that there’s much evidence the economy is strong, calling signs to the contrary just a “detour” and saying interest rates will rise once the headwinds dissipate. The central bank will reveal its latest policy decision Wednesday morning.The pesky trade dispute seems to be the wild card here. And it’s little wonder why: The U.S. and China are Canada’s biggest trading partners.The BoC is “caught between big global uncertainties that are negative and recent data surprises erring on the positive side,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. “There’s a tendency in the U.S. and Canada for the market to take a more dovish view of expected policy than policy makers. The curve will be another element encouraging caution.”Around the world, traders have pushed bond yields lower, as appetite for risk assets wanes and central banks around the globe cut forecasts for growth. The trade war has taken a toll on sentiment, weighing on global stocks and sapping demand for most commodities.The foreign-exchange market isn’t pricing in a dovish central-bank policy stance in Canada just yet. As of Friday, the loonie was still the best performer among currencies from Group-of-10 nations in 2019, supported by crude oil, which had gained 30 per cent this year despite recent losses. The loonie was up 1.5 per cent this year versus the U.S. dollar.Still, the outlook is cloudy. For Canada, 17 per cent of its economic growth is exposed to the fight between the U.S. and China, according to a May 24 report from Bloomberg Intelligence economists. That means the Canadian dollar is 10 per cent overvalued, they argued.Recent economic data indicating strong Canadian employment and retail sales strengthen Poloz’s optimistic position even after the central bank last month abandoned its bias toward rate hikes and dropped a reference to future increases. Citigroup Inc.’s Canada economic surprise index, which measures data surprises relative to market expectations, is at the highest level since April 2017.“That outperformance alone tilts the balance of risks towards a constructive assessment of prospects” in the next BoC policy statement, Shaun Osborne, strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a May 24 note to clients. It “provides the basis for a mildly hawkish hold decision from the policy makers.” He sees the Canadian dollar strengthening to end the year at 78.12 US cents against the greenback. It finished Friday at $74.62.Others aren’t so bullish. The loonie will weaken toward 73.96 US cents after Wednesday’s decision, strategists Andrew Kelvin and Mark McCormick at TD Securities wrote in a note May 24. They expect the yield differences between 5-year and 10-year as well as 10-year and 30-year Canadian government debt to narrow.“The balance of risk around the BoC also supports continued flattening,” they said. The narrative “remains biased towards lacklustre performance” in the currency as better Canadian data “reflects very weak expectations rather than strength in the economy.”Bloomberg.com"

That in turn is likely to impact employment and consumption, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the country’s output.“The Bank of Canada is underestimating what’s to come in regards to residential investment,” Brown said in an interview Monday in Toronto.Capital Economics estimates that the Bank of Canada will cut rates twice this year, dropping the benchmark rate to 1.25 per cent, from 1.75 per cent. That’s far from consensus, with implied policy rates in the swaps market signalling just one rate cut over the next two years, Bloomberg data show.The research firm expects that families will have to use a bigger portion of their income to bolster savings because home equity will be constrained by muted price gains.The Bank of Canada is underestimating what's to come in regards to residential investmentNew home sales in Toronto declined at the start of the last year and remained flat since then, averaging 25,530 units per month, compared with a monthly average of 46,841 units in 2017, according to data from real estate consultant Altus Group. The housing starts adjustment is just beginning, with monthly averages since January 2018 at 39,301 units, compared with 39,703 average in 2017, according to data compiled by Capital Economics based on Statistics Canada data.“Condo developers have to sell about 70 per cent of the units in their condo before they start construction, in order to secure financing,” Brown said. “So the current housing starts represent homes that were actually sold, as pre-construction units, around 18 months ago.”He added that a similar trend is playing out in Vancouver.“It’s a niche data that not many are looking at it,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The unanimous 10-0 decision left the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate at 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Reporters are likely to prod him over whether upside and downside risks remain truly balanced in the eyes of policy makers.Officials also adjusted one of the tools they use to keep the fed funds rate within its target range. In addition to weighing economic developments, Fed officials have endured a steady drumbeat of criticism from Trump over past rate hikes. Powell and his colleagues have said repeatedly they’ll ignore the pressure and chart policy according to what best suits the longer-run prospects of the world’s largest economy.As with recent economic data, the Federal Open Market Committee’s assessment of conditions had something for both hawks and doves.Officials slightly upgraded their assessment of the economy, saying “economic activity rose at a solid rate” while “the labour market remains strong.”That characterization followed a report this week showing consumer spending rebounded in March following a lacklustre start to the year. Previous data had pointed to the consumer as a weak spot in an otherwise solid first quarter.The economy expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized pace from January to March, boosted by exports and inventories growth. The labour market remains robust, with unemployment at around a half- century low and wage gains near the best pace of this expansion.Still, even with consumption intact and the labour market tightening, inflation has remained vexingly low. The Fed’s preferred price gauge climbed just 1.5 per cent in March from a year earlier, well below the central bank’s 2 per cent target.In subtle changes from their last statement, officials said gauges for both overall and core inflation “have declined and are running below 2 per cent.” That removed a line from March blaming energy prices for below-target price gains and removed a reference to core inflation being “near 2 per cent.”The Fed’s fears over low inflation have been mounting, with Powell recently calling it “one of the major challenges of our time.” That’s spurred some speculation that a further slowing in core price gains could prompt officials to cut rates even during a healthy expansion.In a supplemental statement, officials adjusted a tool they use to keep the fed funds rate within its target range, lowering the interest paid on bank reserves deposited with the Fed to 2.35 per cent from 2.4 per cent.This was the third such adjustment in a year for interest on excess reserves, or IOER. As in June and December, the step was taken after the rate banks pay to borrow overnight, known as the effective fed funds rate, drifted upward and threatened to reach the upper end of the target range.The move “is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range,” the technical statement said.Bloomberg.com"

 The bank has introduced an informal rule to allow hiring of one back-office employee only if five are leaving, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. For client-facing staff, the rule is less strict: Managers can hire one banker for two departing ones, the people said. 
 A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. 
 Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti has been hit by a slew of bad news, ranging from investor discontent with his strategy to the departure of his former investment bank head to a US$5 billion penalty in a French tax case. That’s left the stock trailing the rebound in the shares of its main rivals this year. 
 UBS said earlier this year that it would slow hiring and deepen cost cuts during one of the worst first quarters in recent history, which forced the bank to cut an additional US$300 million in costs. The bank said this month that the cost cuts announced in March should pay off in the second half of the year. 
 The Swiss bank slashed thousands of investment banking jobs over the past decade in a pivot toward private banking. While that shift has reduced earnings volatility, it’s left the bank open to revenue dips after market corrections or when clients stay on the sidelines. 
 Its first-quarter results last week were propped up by wealthy private banking customers in Asia, who added the lion’s share of net new money to help offset the investment bank, as it battled through a market trough that left many industry players hurting.

 Jobless claims rose 37,000 to 230,000 in the week ended April 20, according to Labor Department figures Thursday that matched the highest estimate in Bloomberg’s survey. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, increased to 206,000. 
 Key Insights 
The increase in claims snapped a five-week streak of declines, the longest since 2016, indicating that while the labor market may have cooled somewhat it remains robust. Employers in several regions and industries confront higher turnover and find it difficult to hire workers, according to the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book. A Bloomberg survey of economists forecast a gain of 200,000 in the period. The rise in claims for the week was the most since September 2017, according to the Labor Department.

 What Bloomberg’s Economists Say: 
 “Jobless claims continue to point to tight labor market conditions. The number of workers filing new applications for unemployment increased more than expected, but it is not unusual to see some volatility in the week before or after the Easter holiday. Jobless claims will likely revert back to the pre-holiday trend.”-- Eliza Winger, economist

Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, rose slightly to 1.655 million in the week ended April 13. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.2 per cent. The prior week’s claims were revised up to 193,000 from the 192,000 initially reported, which was the lowest level since September 1969."

The two-month gain is the best start to a year since 1981. Canada’s economy has added 290,000 jobs since August, the largest six-month increase since the early 2000s.The much-stronger-than-expected labour market is the only thing giving policy makers comfort amid a run of bleak data in recent months. It’s a key reason why the Bank of Canada is sticking to its belief the economy will rebound and interest rates will likely head higher.The employment gains in recent months come amid an otherwise dismal performance for the economy recently, amid stresses in the oil sector, weakening housing markets, volatility in global financial markets and waning consumer and business confidence. Economists were forecasting a gain of just 1,200 in February.Last week, Canada’s statistics agency reported the nation’s economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the final three months of 2018. Most economists expect the sluggishness to persist in the first six months of this year, before growth picks up steam later in 2019.The jobs increase largely reflects higher labor force numbers, rather than falling unemployment, due to rising participation rates and accelerating population growth over the past couple of years. Much of the increase in Canada’s population comes from international working-age migrants. In an economy with more than half a million vacant jobs, many seem to be finding work.The labour force increased by 55,100 in February, and is up by 159,000 so far this year. Canada’s jobless rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent, even with the employment gains, because more people were looking for work.The breakdown in the numbers was also positive, with 67,400 new full-time jobs offsetting a loss of 11,600 part-time positions.Even the wage picture is looking better.

 Nonfarm payrolls increased by 20,000 after an upwardly revised 311,000 gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for an increase of 180,000. Average hourly earnings rose a better-than- projected 3.4 per cent from a year earlier, while the jobless rate declined to 3.8 per cent, near a five-decade low. 
 Even with faster pay raises, the big miss on payrolls may fuel concern about the mood among U.S. consumers following a December retail-sales slump that was the worst in nine years. Economists project the expansion will slow this year, amid weaker global growth and the fading impact of fiscal stimulus such as President Donald Trump’s tax cuts. 
 At the same time, policy makers and economists might wait for several months of weak hiring before concluding there’s cause for concern in the labor market. Some of the weakness could be chalked up to winter weather, as construction jobs fell by 31,000, though many other sectors were soft including education and health services as well as leisure and hospitality. 
 Even with the pickup in wages, Federal Reserve policy makers have indicated this year they won’t raise interest rates again until seeing inflation advance. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony last week that “the job market remains strong.’’ 
 February Miss 
 This marked the first February since 2011 that the initial reading on payrolls missed the median estimate of economists. The 20,000 gain was the lowest since September 2017, a month marked by the impact of several major hurricanes. 
 Manufacturing payrolls increased by 4,000, trailing the 12,000 median forecast. Retail jobs fell by 6,100, while education and health services posted a meager gain of 4,000 and leisure and hospitality payrolls were unchanged. One solid reading was professional and business services, with a 42,000 increase. 
 The labor-force participation rate was unchanged at a five-year high of 63.2 per cent, while the employment-population ratio, another broad measure of labor-market health, held at 60.7 per cent. 
 Companies have said shortages of skilled workers limit expansion plans. In addition, broader headwinds include continuing uncertainty surrounding trade tension with China, a waning boost from fiscal policy and threats from abroad. 
 Just this week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3.3 per cent from 3.5 per cent, China lowered its economic growth target, and the European Central Bank slashed its projection for the region. 
 Average hourly earnings for private workers rose 0.4 per cent from the prior month, topping estimates, following a 0.1 per cent gain. The annual increase came after a downwardly revised 3.1 advance. Average hourly earnings for production and non- supervisory workers accelerated to a 3.5 per cent annual gain.

Revisions added 12,000 to the payrolls tally from the prior two months. Private payrolls rose by 25,000 in February, compared with the median estimate for 170,000. Government payrolls decreased by 5,000. The average work week decreased to 34.4 hours from 34.5 hours in the prior month; a shorter workweek boosts average hourly pay. The U-6, or underemployment rate, plunged to 7.3 per cent from 8.1 per cent. This includes part-time workers who want a full-time job and people who are less active in seeking work. A separate government report Friday showed new-home construction rebounded in January by more than expected as building permits hit a nine-month high, indicating the housing market is stabilizing amid lower mortgage rates."

Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, climbed 0.8 per cent from the prior month to $767,800.The decline in transactions so far this year extends 2018’s losses which were the worst in a decade, leading to speculation policy makers went too far when they added stress tests to mortgage-lending requirements. The regulator that imposed the rules —the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions — should review them, and amortization periods for federally insured mortgages should be extended to 30 years to give buyers a break, the real estate board said.“The OSFI mandated mortgage stress test has left some buyers on the sidelines who have struggled to qualify for the type of home they want to buy,” Gurcharan Bhaura, TREB’s president, said in a statement. “There is a federal budget and election on the horizon. It will be interesting to see what policy measures are announced to help with home ownership affordability.”Meanwhile, new listings also declined, falling 6.2 per cent from a year earlier to 9,828. The fact new listings fell more than sales suggests conditions became tighter over the past year, supporting price growth, the board said. Average home prices rose 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to $780,397.The semi-detached segment was the best performer, with average prices rising 9.9 per cent to $832,569 on the year. Condo prices jumped 6.1 per cent to $562,161. Detached homes declined 2.1 per cent to $980, 914.The realtor board warned of the potential consequences of any further declines, saying the substantial drop in sales compared with the 2016 peak has translated into a “hit to the economy” in the billions of dollars.“This hit has also translated into lower government revenues and, if sustained, could impact the employment picture as well,” Jason Mercer, the board’s director of market analysis, said in the statement.With assistance from Natalie WongBloomberg.com"

But one group of Apple contractors finds another building, six miles away on Hammerwood Avenue in Sunnyvale, to be a more apt symbol.This building is as bland as the main Apple campus is striking. From the outside, there appears to be a reception area, but it’s unstaffed, which makes sense given that people working in this satellite office — mostly employees of Apple contractors working on Apple Maps — use the back door. Workers say managers instructed them to walk several blocks away before calling for a ride home. Several people who worked here say it’s widely referred to within Apple as a “black site,” as in a covert ops facility.Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending machines to be understocked, and to have to wait in line to use the men’s bathrooms. Architectural surprise and delight wasn’t a priority here; after all, the contract workers at Hammerwood almost all leave after their assignments of 12 to 15 months are up.It’s not uncommon for workers not to make it that long. According to 14 current and former contractors employed by Apex Systems, a firm that staffs the building as well as other Apple mapping offices, they operated under the constant threat of termination. “It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time,” says one former Hammerwood contractor, who, like most of the workers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with Apex. “There was a culture of fear among the contractors which I got infected by and probably spread.”Apex, not Apple, manages the workers it hires. Apple says it requires contracting firms to treat workers with “dignity and respect.” Following an inquiry from Bloomberg News, the company says, it conducted a surprise audit of the Hammerwood facility and found a work environment consistent with other Apple locations. “Like we do with other suppliers, we will work with Apex to review their management systems, including recruiting and termination protocols, to ensure the terms and conditions of employment are transparent and clearly communicated to workers in advance,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement.Buddy Omohundro, Apex’s chief services officer and general counsel, says in an email that his company strives to ensure it’s creating the best possible work experience. “Apex provides multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns, both directly and anonymously, and to have those concerns addressed,” he wrote.It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time.Apex is one tiny part of a sprawling global network of staffing firms working with Apple; it is not even the only firm staffing the facility at Hammerwood Avenue. For Apple Maps alone, workers are spread across several locations in Silicon Valley, as well as in Austin, Tex.; London; the Czech Republic; and India, according to people who worked on the project. The operation involves thousands of contractors. At Hammerwood, the population has exceeded 250 at times, although the number fluctuates and Apple declined to give a current count.Places like Hammerwood undermine the mythology of Silicon Valley as a kind of industrial utopia where talented people work themselves to the bone in exchange for outsize salaries and stock options. A common perception in the Bay Area is that its only serious tech-labour issue is the high cost of living driven by the industry’s obscene salaries. But many of the poorer residents work in tech, too. For decades, contractors and other contingent workers have served meals, driven buses and cleaned toilets at tech campuses. They’ve also built circuit boards and written and tested software, all in exchange for hourly wages and little or no job security.In different forms, temporary labour as an alternative to full-time employment has grown across the U.S. economy. Companies in many industries now use staffing firms to handle work once done by full-time workers. The technology industry offers one of the starkest examples of how the groups’ fortunes have diverged. While companies aren’t required to disclose the sizes of their contingent workforces, there’s ample evidence that tech companies use large numbers of contractors and temps. Last year, Bloomberg News reported that direct employees at Alphabet Inc.’s Google accounted for less than half its workforce.The treatment of these workers is emerging alongside sexual harassment and military contracting as a principal target of the wave of tech worker activism that’s been building over the past two years. When Google employees staged a walkout last November, many contingent workers didn’t learn about it in advance because they don’t have access to internal mailing lists. A month later, Googlers sent an open letter to the company’s management demanding better working conditions for temporary workers, vendors and contractors.The Apple Maps operations staffed by Apex provide a dim view of contract work, according to current and former Apex workers. Some took jobs there with the hope of landing full-time work at Apple — a possibility they said Apex played up —only to find the chances were small. As Apple has faced headwinds in recent months, it has further reduced the practice of converting any contract workers to full-time positions, according to a person familiar with Apple’s operations.Other Apex workers took the job just to put Apple on their resume. Even that benefit was tenuous. Apex managers initially distributed specific wording they could include on their LinkedIn profiles referring to their employer as Apple, via Apex Systems. Last summer, Apex said they had to remove the word “Apple,” describing their employer only as “A Major Tech Company Via Apex Systems,” according to two former employees.The restrictions were just one of many reminders of the contractors’ inferior status, right down to the apple design on their ID badges. For direct employees, the apples were multi-colored; contractors got what one described as “sad grey.” It’s common for companies to distribute different badges to contractors, a practice that discontented workers across the industry have seized on as evidence of a caste system. Amber Lutsko, who worked for Apple through Apex in 2017 and 2018, described an opening-day pep talk that aimed to make her feel both honored and excluded. “‘You work at Apple now! You have made it!’” she recalls being told. “‘You’re not allowed to use the gym.’”The companies of Silicon Valley have created vast fortunes with far fewer employees than the corporate behemoths that came before them. In part, this is because you can replicate software infinitely in a way you can’t with, say, a Model T. But the tech industry was also an early adopter of offloading core functions to contract workers. Tech was quick to embrace contractors because of rapid advancements requiring constant adjustments in the composition of the workforce, according to Louis Hyman, author of the 2018 book “Temp.” All those changes helped nurture Silicon Valley’s ideology of flexibility and speed, first in hardware, then in software and business operations. Hyman quotes a 1993 issue of Apple’s internal magazine that describes the transition away from direct employees to contractors and outsourcing firms as both a “predictable evolution” and “the future.”Conflict is inevitable in a two-tiered workforce. As far back as the 1990s, Microsoft Corp. contractors challenged their employment status in court and attempted to unionize. In 2014 a group of Microsoft bug-testers won the right to bargain with their employer, a staffing agency called Lionbridge Technologies Inc. Within a few years, Lionsbridge had eliminated all their jobs.Apple, which has about 130,000 full-time employees, also accepts workers from about three dozen staffing firms, according to OnContracting, a website providing market information to staffing companies. Contracting firms work on iTunes and server infrastructure, handle customer support, and select articles for Apple News. Apex, the largest division of ASGN, a staffing company based in suburban Los Angeles, has provided Apple with a steady stream of mapping technicians, whose jobs consist of checking to make sure that Apple’s software is drawing roads in the right places, or responding to reports of inaccuracies in existing maps.They’re largely in their early- to mid-20s, and have often just graduated from college. Wages are generally about US$25 an hour, which some workers consider generous and others see as stingy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median hourly wage for mapping technicians nationwide was $20.84, while the median per-hour rate for the same jobs in California was $30.61.Apex employees have access to health insurance, although the premiums are high enough that some people opt not to take it. Because the workforce is young, Apex workers often stay on their parents’ health insurance.The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they'd made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The 'Oh you didn't make it through training, please give us your badge now'.Apex has also suddenly changed aspects of employment. In November, it cut the maximum amount of paid sick time employees could take annually from 48 hours to 24 hours, saying the policy would go into effect in two days, according to two current employees and an internal email viewed by Bloomberg. The email, which Apex workers received on a Thursday afternoon, inspired a rare moment of collective action. A group of over a dozen workers said they had suddenly fallen ill, and left, according to one current Apex employee who participated in the protest.“At all times, Apex has provided as much paid sick leave as required by applicable law,” says Omohundro, adding that the company worked to find exceptions in individual cases.Many Apex employees first heard about the company through LinkedIn. The company trawls the website for people with proficiency in skills for mapmaking like geographic information systems or geography, then messages them repeatedly. Lutsko had worked as an archaeologist and was between jobs in 2017 when, as she describes it, she basically gave in. “They’re pretty aggressive, so it was easy to take the job,” she says.At the beginning of the interview process, Apex doesn’t mention the company where people will work. But the revelation can tip wavering candidates over the edge. “They said it was with Apple — they were super hush-hush originally — and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’,” says a former Apex worker who started in 2017. “‘That will be on my resume? Bang!’”They said it was with Apple — they were super hush-hush originally — and I was like, 'Oh my God! That will be on my resume? Bang!'The secrecy just made the job seem sexier. Many Apex workers assumed discretion was required because Hammerwood had some connection to self-driving cars. Their own work turned out to be drudgery. Still, they gossiped about the mysterious group of direct Apple employees who also worked on the site. They never knew for sure what those people were up to, since they say managers at Apex kept them from communicating with Apple employees unless it was necessary to do their immediate jobs. One former Apex worker says the contractors weren’t allowed to use the bathrooms on the direct employees’ side of the building.Complaints about the bathrooms were common. Lines formed outside the men’s rooms, especially around lunchtime, according to former employees. (Because the workforce was predominantly male, the women’s rooms had ample capacity.) Anonymous complaints about inadequate facilities were scrawled on white boards around the office. Twice in 2017, Hammerwood workers filed complaints against Apple with the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA. Apple told Cal/OSHA it had examined the situation and determined it was in compliance with the law. There was no mention of Apex workers being discouraged from using certain bathrooms, according to records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request. The agency did not pursue the issue.The working environment was uncomfortable in other ways, according to current and former contractors. Apex managers sometimes broke up unauthorized water-cooler socializing. Several workers say their managers would get notifications if their workstations were idle for too long. “Being monitored like that is super dehumanizing and terrifying,” says one former Apex mapping technician.If Apex seemed not to trust its workers, the feeling was mutual. They described a hiring process that was misleading in several ways. For one, Apex failed to explain the one-year assignments started with several weeks of training followed by a test, many say. Anyone who didn’t pass was terminated immediately. The company recruited nationwide, so some workers showed up in California, signed leases in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and lost their only source of income within a matter of weeks.There are no reliable numbers on how common such firings were; Omohundro says the “vast majority” of employees complete their assignments. But they loomed large even for those who passed the test. Lutsko says watching colleagues suddenly lose their jobs soured her on her new employer. “I couldn’t handle the arbitrariness of everything,” she says. “The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they’d made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The ‘Oh you didn’t make it through training, please give us your badge now.’”Lutsko quit before her contract was up. The LinkedIn messages from Apex recruiters persisted. This was common. Two people who Apex had fired said the company periodically pitches them on jobs. “You got rid of me because of my quote-unquote performance, and every three months I get these emails,” says one of them. “It’s insulting, honestly.”Like any group of people in shared circumstance, workers at Hammerwood bonded. Several former contractors say it was fun to be around with people their own age, and say the odd atmosphere only made them closer. Because many of them were young, new to the area, and not making enough money to live on their own, they ended up pooling resources to rent apartments or houses nearby.Many people simply moved to similar contracting jobs with other tech firms once their positions at Apple end, so their homes ended up having a mixture of Facebook, Google and Uber contractors. Several people described the geographic information systems contracting workforce almost as if it were a resource the big tech companies shared. People who left Apple would join the GIS staff at another company and find it was staffed primarily by Apex veterans.Those who left Apple often say their lives improved. Facebook’s management put signs up around campus reading “Contractors Are People Too,” and contingent workers participated in on-campus arts and crafts activities. Google paid more than competitors and let everyone use the gym, says Nick Wilson, who worked at Apple through Apex, then worked at Facebook, and is now a contractor doing mapping work at Google.Moving between companies didn’t feel like advancement, says Wilson. “None of the skills I learned at Apple could be carried over,” he says, adding that his managers were indifferent to any attempts by employees to distinguish themselves. “There were many people who took initiative and made things, increased the efficiency. They weren’t rewarded in any way,” he says. “There were people who had abandoned any hope. They’d come in late, leave early, and just do nothing all day. They were treated the same as everyone else.” (Both Lutsko and Wilson declined to discuss the exact nature of their jobs or the building at which they worked, citing their nondisclosure agreements.)The mood at Hammerwood dimmed late last year, after the changes in benefits and after Apex suddenly fired about two dozen people, according to two current Apex employees. One described the workplace as depressing and quiet, with everyone on edge. “I’m afraid of being too social because they might see that as not working hard enough,” he says. “Apex handles all terminations in a sensitive and confidential manner,” says Omohundro. “The company does not share the details of employee terminations, regardless of whether they are for cause or not for cause.”Activists associated with the burgeoning labour movement in the tech industry say the contracting workforce is ripe for organization, but acknowledge it’s been challenging to organize white-collar workers. “It’s a new concept,” says Yana Calou, an organizer at Coworker.org. Information workers have been more reticent than security guards and cafeteria workers to confront tech companies because they’re angling for full-time work, says Calou. “I think there’s the tiny idea of, ‘I’ll be the exception that squeezes through.’ ”That feeling eventually wears off. One former Apex worker, a 32-year-old who lives in the maid’s quarters of a house with eight roommates, says years of uncertainty have left him worn out. “How are you supposed to plan for your future if your job has an expiration date?” he says. He’s a California native who moved to San Francisco over a decade ago, got a master’s degree, and internalized Silicon Valley’s brand of optimism. But that evaporated at Apple’s so-called black site. “It sounds good when you say you work at Apple, but when you’re not being paid the same amount, and you’re not treated the same way, it gets old quickly,” he says. “I don’t see why they don’t just hire someone and give them a stake in the company.”— With assistance from Josh Eidelson and Mark GurmanBloomberg.com"

That was driven by a 99,200 gain in services, which offset falling employment in goods producing industries. The gains were almost evenly split between full-time and part-time positions.The picture is much stronger than anyone expected in an economy hit by stresses in the oil sector, weakening housing markets, volatility in global financial markets and waning consumer confidence. The report could ease some concerns about the extent of a current soft patch. Economists were forecasting only a 5,000 employment increase in January.Even with the gains, Canada’s jobless rate jumped to 5.8 per cent last month, from 5.6 per cent in December. But the reason for the increase was more people looking for work — a sign of strength that could indicate the jobs market is pulling new workers into the labor force. That could give the economy more room to run without fuelling wage pressures.The labour force increased by 103,700, the biggest one-month increase since 2009. The increase was led by a 60,500 increase in the number of youth joining the jobs market. Youth — people aged 15 to 24 — also led the employment gains, with a 52,800 increase.The jump in January brought employment gains over the past 12 months to 327,200, the biggest year-over-year gain since 2017.Another positive was a shift away from self-employment. The number of people employed by the private sector jumped by 111,500, the biggest one-month gain on record in data going back to 1976. The number of self-employed fell by 60,700.Ontario, with an employment gain of 41,400, led the job surge among provinces.There continues to be some weaknesses in the numbers. Wage gains remain depressed. Average hourly wages were up 2 per cent form a year ago, with pay for permanent employees up 1.8 per cent.Alberta, which is struggling with slumping oil prices and production curbs in the sector, posted a second straight monthly decline in employment.There were also broad-based losses among goods-producing sectors, including manufacturing.Total hours worked rose 1.2 per cent in January from a year earlier, which is up from 0.9 per cent in December.Bloomberg.com"

The November oil shock was spurred by a supply glut and pipeline crunch. Prices have recovered somewhat, but clouds remain for Canada’s crude outlook.Asked about a recent slowdown in growth in the Canadian economy, Morneau pointed to the oil sector as a factor.“I think you just identified what the soft patch is — the oil shock obviously hit our resource sector in Alberta, so we had a slowdown in Q4 against our expectations, but we do still think that we’ll have a positive year this year,” he said. “I think that particular shock is working its way through the system.”Canada continues to have decades-low unemployment, and the government will continue to focus on Canada’s middle class, he said. “There’s both headwinds because of trade, obviously, and recovering from that oil shock, which is going to take some time,” he said. “We have trading relationships with two-thirds of the world’s economies, so we’re well positioned in a challenging time.”We have trading relationships with two-thirds of the world's economies, so we're well positioned in a challenging time.As a feud with China continues, Morneau said the tensions are having a chilling effect for some travellers and investors, but there are no signs the Asian country is actively trying to hurt Canadian economic interests. “(I) can’t really directly say that I’m seeing that,” he said, citing recent strong Chinese demand for Canadian government bonds.“We issued Canadian government bonds last week and we saw exceptionally strong demand internationally, and that included some of our Chinese demand,” Morneau said. “Of course, for investors, there’s a moment where people are having some pause, for travellers, you’re clearly questioning your ability to do the business you want to do. So that is the moment we’re in right now. We’re seeking paths to get past this.” Bloomberg.com"

But pessimists fear the impact could become more widespread as federal workers miss out on paycheques, government bureaucracy slows and the effects trickle out to the broader economy. Terry Haines, Evercore ISI’s head of political analysis, cited research in a note Thursday that found the shutdown could reduce quarterly economic growth anywhere from 0.5 to 2 percentage points.For all the hand-wringing, the overall market impact has been limited so far. The S&P 500 Index has gained 8.6 per cent since the day before the closure. Furthermore, U.S. equities have historically fared well after shutdowns, demonstrating the negative economic impact isn’t usually enough to derail a market rally on its own, according to an LPL Financial Research note Thursday.“It’s important to recognize, however, that the current shutdown has lasted for an unprecedented amount of time with no end in sight,” the note said.The longer we go, the more we delve into uncharted waters and, as we all know, this market hates uncertainty.Analysts are bumping up their estimates for just how long this shutdown will last. There’s a 40 per cent chance the political stalemate will extend into February as President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi show no signs of softening their resolve, according to Haines. He previously predicted it would “very likely” be resolved by the end of January.“This is incrementally market negative because a longer shutdown could begin both to have real economic impact and to negatively affect market sentiment,” Haines wrote.The latest sign of potential trouble came in the Labor Department’s most recent jobs data. While filings for unemployment benefits fell to a five-week low, data showed that initial filings by federal employees jumped to 10,454 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Jan. 5, double the level in the week ended Dec. 29 and 10 times the amount reported in the week ended Dec. 22.“Every day, I believe, investors begin to get a little more insight into the implications of a partial shutdown,” said Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd. “We could see it show up in diminished air travel and a whole host of other areas that may not have even been considered just a few weeks ago as potential victims of the shutdown.”— With assistance from Sarah Ponczek.Bloomberg.com"

They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,” Trump said in a tweet Monday. “The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch — he can’t putt!”The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch – he can’t putt!Trump’s latest broadside added to the sense of alarm among investors already rattled by turmoil in Washington that includes his private musings about sacking Powell and the government shutdown that followed his about-face on a stopgap spending bill. U.S. stocks fell back toward their session lows after Trump’s outburst, with the S&P 500 Index on track to close at a 19-month low.The president’s Twitter post didn’t mention Powell, a Trump nominee who has overseen four rate hikes this year to prevent the economy from overheating.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sought to reassure investors over the weekend that Powell’s job is safe. He held a conference call Monday with regulators that oversee banks and markets to try, without success, to restore calm.“The market is lacking full confidence in the Fed right now, but part of it is Trump’s undermining of it,” said Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors LLC in Washington and former Treasury official under President George W. Bush.While Fed rate hikes have contributed to equity declines and a softer housing market, the American economy is being buffeted by a few factors owing to the Trump administration and Congress.Trump’s trade war with China is creating uncertainty for businesses. U.S. government debt is approaching US$22 trillion. A federal shutdown this week is raising concerns about Washington’s ability to find bipartisan solutions to pressing problems.Recent data show economic growth is holding up fairly well but may moderate heading into next year. The labour market is solid and unemployment at 3.7 per cent is the lowest since 1969. One measure of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in December as views on economic conditions improved, helping bolster the outlook for American spending.Gross domestic product is seen expanding 2.9 per cent this year, buoyed by tax cuts and higher federal spending signed by Trump, but the pace is expected to slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus fades. The White House argues lower corporate taxes will boost productivity and help the economy grow faster without causing inflation, and therefore the Fed doesn’t need to tighten policy.The turmoil engulfing Washington — and the financial market rout that’s happening in response — widened after Bloomberg News, late Friday, reported Trump’s discussion about firing Powell. Mnuchin said in a pair of tweets Saturday evening that he’d spoken with the president about the matter, and he quoted Trump saying he didn’t believe he had the authority to remove the central bank chief.Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s pick for the next White House chief of staff, said Sunday he’d spoken to Mnuchin and that Trump “now realizes he does not have the ability” to fire a Fed chairman.Trump has yet to publicly affirm that belief himself.Bloomberg.com"

Investors may have been swayed by the Fed’s generally upbeat analysis and expectation of more rate increases than markets anticipate.Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at a press conference after the decision on Wednesday, stressed that policy was not on a preset course.“There’s significant uncertainty about the — both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases,” Powell told reporters. “Inflation has still remained just a touch below two per cent. So I do think that gives the committee the ability to be patient in moving forward.”Powell and his colleagues said “economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,’’ according to a statement following the two-day meeting in Washington. While officials said risks to their outlook “are roughly balanced,” they flagged threats from a softening world economy.The Federal Open Market Committee “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook,” the statement said. The 10-0 decision lifted the federal funds rate target to a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.The quarter-point hike came after Trump assailed the Fed on Twitter for two straight days, urging it to hold rates steady in the most public assault on its political independence in decades. Investors are also fretting over the economy, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly in recent weeks.Answering questions during the press conference, Powell said political considerations play no role in Fed policy making. “We’re going to do our jobs the way we’ve always done them,” he said when asked about White House pressure. The Fed will do its analysis and “nothing will cause us to deviate from that,” he added.Officials also altered key language in their statement, saying the FOMC “judges that some further gradual increases” in rates will likely be needed, a shift from previous language saying the FOMC “expects that further gradual increases” would be required. In addition, the median estimate among policy makers for the so- called neutral rate in the long run fell to 2.75 per cent, from 3 per cent in the previous forecasts from September. The median projection is for the benchmark rate to end 2021 at 3.1 per cent, down from a prior estimate of 3.4 per cent.Those are more acknowledgments that rates are moving closer to the point where policy makers will at least take a break from the quarterly procession of hikes they pursued throughout 2018.When taken together, the latest quarter-point move, language changes and shift in rate projections indicate continued confidence in the economy, yet also greater caution over how far and fast the Fed expects to move with future hikes. As Powell has said, the Fed is now feeling its way forward and will act in line with how the economy performs.Investors have had a more pessimistic view than the Fed, foreseeing one increase at most in 2019, according to interest- rate futures prices.In a related move, the Fed lifted the interest rate it pays on bank reserves deposited at the central bank by just 20 basis points, instead of the usual 25 basis points that would match the quarter-point increase for the fed funds target range. As with a similar move in June, the action was aimed at containing the effective fed funds rate inside the target range.He’ll be aiming to strike a careful balance, expressing a still-positive view on the U.S. economy without telegraphing a policy outlook that investors might view as too aggressive for an economy that appears somewhat more fragile than just a few months ago.While job creation has slowed slightly, over the past several months it has still easily outstripped the number needed to accommodate population growth. Unemployment in November remained at 3.7 per cent, its lowest since 1969. That has helped lift wages but hasn’t provoked any serious signs of excessive inflation.Still, many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 and into 2020, and the Fed’s median estimate for gross domestic product expansion in 2019 fell to 2.3 per cent from 2.5 per cent.Previous hikes and a stronger dollar will gradually bite into the economy just as fiscal stimulus fades and foreign economies from China to Europe also cool. Meanwhile, the ongoing trade dispute with China and a potentially chaotic exit for the U.K. from the European Union represent significant additional risks.Financial markets have been turbulent for weeks, with the S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks dropping 13 per cent from the end of September through Tuesday. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries have also been volatile, dropping to 2.82 per cent this week after hitting a seven-year high of 3.26 per cent in October.Powell’s task is also complicated by the repeated attacks from Trump.Bloomberg.com"
157,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Gillian Tan and Katia Porzecanski,Men on Wall Street are so spooked by the #MeToo movement they're avoiding women at all costs,"Wall Street risks becoming more of a boy's club, rather than less of one",,,,,2018-12-03,https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/wall-street-rule-for-the-metoo-era-avoid-women-at-all-cost?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/wall-street.jpg,"No more dinners with female colleagues. Don’t sit next to them on flights. Book hotel rooms on different floors. Avoid one-on-one meetings.In fact, as a wealth adviser put it, just hiring a woman these days is “an unknown risk.” What if she took something he said the wrong way?Across Wall Street, men are adopting controversial strategies for the #MeToo era and, in the process, making life even harder for women.Call it the Pence Effect, after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he avoids dining alone with any woman other than his wife. In finance, the overarching impact can be, in essence, gender segregation.Interviews with more than 30 senior executives suggest many are spooked by #MeToo and struggling to cope. “It’s creating a sense of walking on eggshells,” said David Bahnsen, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley who’s now an independent adviser overseeing more than US$1.5 billion.This is hardly a single-industry phenomenon, as men across the country check their behaviour at work, to protect themselves in the face of what they consider unreasonable political correctness — or to simply do the right thing. The upshot is forceful on Wall Street, where women are scarce in the upper ranks. The industry has also long nurtured a culture that keeps harassment complaints out of the courts and public eye, and has so far avoided a mega-scandal like the one that has engulfed Harvey Weinstein.Now, more than a year into the #MeToo movement — with its devastating revelations of harassment and abuse in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond — Wall Street risks becoming more of a boy’s club, rather than less of one.“Women are grasping for ideas on how to deal with it, because it is affecting our careers,” said Karen Elinski, president of the Financial Women’s Association and a senior vice president at Wells Fargo & Co. “It’s a real loss.”Women are grasping for ideas on how to deal with it, because it is affecting our careersThere’s a danger, too, for companies that fail to squash the isolating backlash and don’t take steps to have top managers be open about the issue and make it safe for everyone to discuss it, said Stephen Zweig, an employment attorney with FordHarrison.“If men avoid working or traveling with women alone, or stop mentoring women for fear of being accused of sexual harassment,” he said, “those men are going to back out of a sexual harassment complaint and right into a sex discrimination complaint.”While the new personal codes for dealing with #MeToo have only just begun to ripple, the shift is already palpable, according to the people interviewed, who declined to be named. They work for hedge funds, law firms, banks, private equity firms and investment-management firms.For obvious reasons, few will talk openly about the issue. Privately, though, many of the men interviewed acknowledged they’re channeling Pence, saying how uneasy they are about being alone with female colleagues, particularly youthful or attractive ones, fearful of the rumour mill or of, as one put it, the potential liability.A manager in infrastructure investing said he won’t meet with female employees in rooms without windows anymore; he also keeps his distance in elevators. A late-40-something in private equity said he has a new rule, established on the advice of his wife, an attorney: no business dinner with a woman 35 or younger.The changes can be subtle but insidious, with a woman, say, excluded from casual after-work drinks, leaving male colleagues to bond, or having what should be a private meeting with a boss with the door left wide open.On Wall Street as elsewhere, reactions to #MeToo can smack of paranoia, particularly given the industry’s history of protecting its biggest revenue generators.“Some men have voiced concerns to me that a false accusation is what they fear,” said Zweig, the lawyer. “These men fear what they cannot control.”There are as many or more men who are responding in quite different ways. One, an investment adviser who manages about 100 employees, said he briefly reconsidered having one-on-one meetings with junior women. He thought about leaving his office door open, or inviting a third person into the room.Finally, he landed on the solution: “Just try not to be an asshole.”That’s pretty much the bottom line, said Ron Biscardi, chief executive officer of Context Capital Partners. “It’s really not that hard.”Just try not to be an assholeIn January, as #MeToo was gathering momentum, Biscardi did away with the late-night, open-bar gathering he’d hosted for years in his penthouse suite during Context Capital’s annual conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. “Given the fact that women are in the minority at our events, we want to make sure that the environment is always welcoming and comfortable. We felt that eliminating the after-party was necessary to remain consistent with that goal.”In this charged environment, the question is how the response to #MeToo might actually end up hurting women’s progress. Given the male dominance in Wall Street’s top jobs, one of the most pressing consequences for women is the loss of male mentors who can help them climb the ladder.“There aren’t enough women in senior positions to bring along the next generation all by themselves,” said Lisa Kaufman, chief executive officer of LaSalle Securities. “Advancement typically requires that someone at a senior level knows your work, gives you opportunities and is willing to champion you within the firm. It’s hard for a relationship like that to develop if the senior person is unwilling to spend one-on-one time with a more junior person.”Men have to step up, she said, and “not let fear be a barrier.”–With assistance from Max Abelson and Sonali Basak.Bloomberg.com"

O'Sullivan,"Even if OPEC decides to cut, oil prices could still fall in 2019","Opinion: The group is unable to deliver sustainable reductions alone, and geopolitical forces may see other players unwilling to pitch in",,,,,2018-11-29,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/even-if-opec-cuts-oil-prices-could-still-fall-in-2019,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/aafp_1b20uv.jpg,"Some Americans are starting to associate turkey with low oil prices.On Thanksgiving Day in 2014, OPEC held a meeting in Vienna, the outcome of which set off a dramatic slide in oil prices. The price of Brent crude dropped US$6 a barrel, or eight per cent, in just the 24 hours after OPEC announced the outcome of its meeting. This Thanksgiving, there was no OPEC gathering, but last Friday, the Brent price still slid nearly US$4, or six per cent, to its lowest mark in a year. Although the price has since stabilized, we cannot rule out a further slip in the weeks or months ahead.The recent decrease in oil prices is what academics like to call “over-determined.” Despite recent jitters about a looming spike in the price of oil, both supply and demand have conspired to bring down prices. New production has come on line in recent months, be it from Clair Ridge (BP’s new mega-oil field in the North Sea), record amounts of shale oil coming out of the U.S., or simply production increases by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia. Other developments — such as the hope to resolve infrastructure bottlenecks in the U.S. and a new agreement between Baghdad and the Kurds to allow the restart of exports from Kirkuk’s contested oil fields — promise even more oil in the months ahead. Unexpected sanctions waivers issued by the Trump administration mean Iranian oil will not be squeezed out of global markets just yet. Meanwhile, the robust growth in oil demand of the past years appears to be easing, especially with trade frictions looking persistent.Oil’s price could get another knock soon, depending on the outcome of the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6. Some variant of any of the usual three outcomes is possible: a real deal, rhetoric about a deal, or no deal. But the market will be particularly sensitive to the result, given the other factors weighing down oil right now.Prospects for a real deal — one that brings significant quantities of oil off the market to boost prices for a sustained period — are not particularly bright. OPEC alone is no longer capable of delivering a real deal.One of the lessons of the past few years is that, given new forces in the market, particularly America’s shale oil, OPEC countries must join with others if they are going to be able to effect a significant enough cut to oil markets to notably raise prices and restore balance. The much-heralded Declaration of Cooperation of December 2016 brought 11 other countries alongside OPEC’s traditional members. True, OPEC has formally welcomed new members into its ranks since this time, but neither Equatorial Guinea nor Congo bring game-changing cutting capacity to the organization. A real deal requires that the diverse group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers that stood together in 2016 do so once again in two weeks’ time.Nor, at the other end of the extreme, can Saudi Arabia deliver a “real deal” on its own. In past decades, Saudi Arabia was sometimes willing to bear the brunt of production cuts in order to stabilize the oil price. In the past few years, Riyadh has declared its unwillingness to do this, often invoking its experience in the 1980s when its economy stumbled as a result of it bearing deep and extended solo production cuts. In recent days, the Saudis seem determined to return to the production levels of 2016 — another way of saying they could cut current production by as much as one million barrels a day. The Saudis do have room to execute such a cut; they are now producing at record levels and even a major cut would still leave them with substantial exports.A real deal requires that the diverse group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers that stood together in 2016 do so once againSuch a more-or-less unilateral move could have immediate costs. First, as widely noted, it could draw the ire of President Donald Trump, just when he has declared his willingness to stand by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman after the CIA linked the royal to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition, a big Saudi solo cut could erode the sense of joint responsibility for global oil markets instilled by the Declaration of Cooperation. And, as we know from recent years, such a cut will invite other producers to the market — likely in less than a year thanks to American shale — bringing down the price once again, this time at the expense of Saudi market share.Nevertheless, domestic pressures could induce MBS to prioritize the short term — and favour what is essentially a solo cut — over the medium and longer run. It is difficult to assess the domestic strength of the crown prince in the wake of the Khashoggi murder. But the probable execution of those in his inner circle for an operation he likely sanctioned will weaken his power base. He may have calculated that he cannot compound this situation with an economy that stresses the country with more unemployment and slowed growth. The relatively higher oil prices of 2018 have given Saudi Arabia a reprieve from the economic difficulties and grumblings of 2017, when the Saudi economy actually contracted. The crown prince may perceive it as essential that he has some economic largesse to weather the immediate political storm. Over the medium and longer term, however, Saudi Arabia cannot be expected to sustain solo cuts in the face of a moderating price and a shrunken Saudi market share.… even a major cut would still leave (the Saudis) with substantial exportsAnother option for Dec. 6 is a deal in rhetoric across OPEC and its non-OPEC brethren, but no deal in practice. This is the most likely scenario, and the market will be watching for it closely, with an eye on Russia and Iraq in particular. Before 2016, the Russian government often pledged cooperation with OPEC but never delivered on it. In the recent months, Russia has been producing over 11 million barrels of oil, notably beyond what it was producing before the 2016 production cuts. Iraq has had a quiet but significant boom in recent months, reaching record levels of 4.7 million barrels a day with additional production increases on the horizon. With a new government in Baghdad under pressure from its population to deliver services, and pressure from Washington to sever energy ties with Iran, Iraq will resist reining in its oil production now.The final option for Dec. 6 is, of course, an overt no-deal scenario. It is the least likely of the options, but it is not impossible. Tensions are running high in the region, and confidence in Saudi leadership — generally perceived to be the responsible actor of OPEC — has been shaken. Should an obvious no-deal situation materialize, expect the price of oil to plunge quickly, particularly in light of current market expectations. An overwhelming majority of analysts expect a supply cut, according to a recent Bloomberg poll.We will most likely see some sort of action in Vienna on Dec. 6 and even before. Yet anything short of a re-enactment of the Declaration of Cooperation moment of 2016 should be seen as only a short-term boost to prices in early 2019 and a likely precursor to an eventual price drop as 2019 progresses. A go-it-alone approach by Saudi Arabia is not sustainable, just as an agreement to cut without Russian and Iraqi enthusiasm is likely to be an empty promise.• Meghan L.

She’s up against 3,779 others, so the odds of winning are only about 50:1 but figures it’s as good a chance as any of finding a place to live.Long priced out of home ownership, Ross is now being squeezed out of the rental market as the country’s biggest population boom since 1957 sends prices surging in Canada’s biggest city.The 56-year-old unemployed office worker pays $1,026 (US$776) for her one-bedroom apartment. Her savings and unemployment insurance are running out and she’s been looking for a cheaper place but units that were in her price range only a few years ago have nearly doubled.“It’s so stressful and I suffer from heart palpitations and anxiety,” said Ross from her 24th-floor apartment where hanging plants and bright cushions create a refuge in a dingy building in constant combat with pest infestations.As U.S. President Donald Trump has clamped down on high-tech visas and amped up the anti-immigration rhetoric Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a more welcoming approach. Canada took in a record 413,000 people from abroad in the year through July 1, pushing population growth to 1.4 per cent, the fastest in the Group of Seven.Almost 100,000 of those immigrants have landed in Toronto in the past year, including refugee claimants, a surge in international students and workers chasing thousands of new high-tech jobs at companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Add in those who can’t meet stricter mortgage regulations after house prices jumped 60 per cent in the past five years and it’s been an all out war for rentals.“We’ve reached a point now where given the amount of people, industries we’re attracting, we are already becoming terribly unaffordable for everyone,” said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of several books on urban issues. “We’re at a crisis and we don’t even realize it: Our transit, traffic problem and housing problem are urgent matters.”Supply isn’t beginning to keep up. Condo completions have been running near a five-year low of about 10,000 units, according to Altus Group Ltd. And only about 60 purpose-built rental buildings have been constructed since 2005, bringing a meager 11,620 units to market when the city’s been creating about 17,000 renter households a year, according to property research firm Urbanation Inc.The result has been skyrocketing prices. Condo rents soared 7.6 per cent to an average $2,385 in the third quarter over the same period a year ago and were up 17 per cent for newly available purpose-built units, according to data from Urbanation. Meanwhile, the apartment vacancy rate sits at about 0.5 per cent.Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,That might still be a bargain compared with cities like San Francisco, where a one-bedroom went for US$3,333 in 2017 or New York where it cost US$2,811, though prices in those cities have stabilized over the past year.Those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder are getting hit the hardest.“Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,” said Alejandra Ruiz Vargas, a member at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now Canada, which represents low and moderate-income families.With asylum claims to Canada also doubling in the past year, it’s getting harder for refugees to find housing too, said Lucy Chaimiti, executive director at Adam House, a refugee support group. It usually takes people four to six months to find housing after arriving in the city and they usually end up spending about 85 per cent of their social assistance income on housing, she said.City and provincial policymakers are beginning to wake up to the brewing affordability crisis. In an election dominated by housing last month, Mayor John Tory pledged to bring 40,000 affordable rental units to the city over the next decade, offering city land, cash incentives and to cancel or defer development charges and taxes.While there are rent controls on existing units, the new provincial government has dropped them on new construction in an effort to entice development. Some builders such as Tricon Capital Group Inc. have already jumped on the affordable bandwagon.Affordable housing needs to be created for those who “are not investment bankers or cannabis entrepreneurs,” RioCan REIT Chief Executive Officer Ed Sonshine said in an earnings call in October. RioCan is interested in getting into the market, but government incentives needs to be higher, he said in a phone interview.Toronto meanwhile, needs to get more creative to broaden the types of housing available, said Florida, at University of Toronto. Companies could focus on housing that uses pre-treated timber or modular construction, speedier, cheaper home-building alternatives.“Everyone’s getting priced out,” he said. “My students at the Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto, who are going to be some of the most successful students in Canadian business, are now saying it’s doubtful they could ever afford a single-family home.”Meanwhile, Ross is running out of options as she scrambles to secure future housing. She’s anxiously awaiting to hear back from the lottery which is offering up a one-bedroom unit for $962 including utilities in the redeveloped Regent Park. The former crack haven is now a mixed-used neighbourhood that includes affordable rentals and market-priced condos alongside sports fields, an aquatic centre, community meeting spaces and cafes.The city will likely need dozens of such neighbourhoods to handle the influx in newcomers.At one point, Ross even called a shelter to see what her options would be if she was kicked out of her apartment. “They said you have to call weeks in advance. How do you call weeks in advance if you don’t know when you’re going to be homeless?”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

 The country retained its title for the fifth consecutive year on the World Talent Ranking report published by IMD Business School, a result of its strong emphasis on skills training and education. Denmark and Norway were ranked second and third respectively in the poll, which was dominated by European countries. 
 While the U.S. didn’t make it to the top 10, it climbed four places to rank 12th. The U.K. slid two spots to 23. Canada was the only non-European country to feature among the top 10. 
 ""Economies placed in the top 10 of the ranking generally share high levels of investment in public education and a high quality of life, which allow them both to develop local human capital and to attract highly-skilled professionals from abroad,"" said Arturo Bris, director of the IMD World Competitiveness Center. 
 Singapore was the highest-ranking Asian economy on the index, coming in at 13th place and outranking Hong Kong, which dropped six places this year to 18th. Both economies continued to excel in attracting professionals from abroad but lagged in terms of investment in education, the report noted. 
 China was ranked 39th because of its difficulties in attracting foreign skilled workers and because its public spending on education remains below the average of advanced economies, the report said. 
 Latin American countries were among the least competitive with Mexico in 61st position. Venezuela was last on the list at No. 63. Both countries suffered from a brain drain and relatively low public spending on education, according to the report. 
 The study surveyed over six thousand executives in 63 economies. Each economy was assessed on various factors including how they invest in developing the local workforce, the extent to which they are able to attract and retain skilled workers and the quality of skills available in their respective talent pools.

Well, has Sears Holdings Corp. got a job for you. 
 The department-store chain posted 75 new positions to its career page Monday, the same day it filed for Chapter 11 in White Plains, New York. Many of the postings are for seasonal, part-time work at either Sears or Kmart stores, including cashiers, sales associates and customer service representatives -- the critical roles that traditionally carry the holiday season. 
 The new listings Monday bring the total number of open jobs on Sears’s website to 4,788. To fill those posts, the company was planning a national hiring day on Oct. 20 at all stores, according to a flier distributed at the Oak Brook, Illinois, location last week. Sears already held a similar event on Oct. 9 at all of its locations. 
 The company did not immediately respond to a query on whether the hiring day was still scheduled after the bankruptcy filing. The event was listed on its careers website as of Monday morning. 
 Meanwhile, 68,000 Sears employees are wondering about the future of their careers today. In addition to 142 store closures to begin “immediately,” the 125-year-old retailer said it will select any additional stores to close after a comprehensive analysis of their “profitability, ability to be sold during a possible sales process and negative leasehold value.” 
 The retailer’s lenders are trying to nail down financing to help ensure stores are kept open through the crucial holiday season. Sears heads into a court hearing scheduled for later today with key details of its recovery plan still missing.

 The Labor Department on Friday cited a loss of 31,800 positions in the “sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores” sector last month, likely related to 33,000 workers being left jobless by the shutdown of the largest U.S. toy retailer. 
 Toys “R” Us closed the last of its hundreds of U.S. stores at the end of June, leaving employees without severance pay. The retailer had struggled for years with US$5 billion in debt from its 2005 buyout, along with new competition from online and discount retailers. 
 Eight former Toys “R” Us workers traveled to Washington this week to meet with several U.S. senators. They asked the lawmakers to consider measures to prevent a similar scenario in the future, and for help in securing compensation in lieu of the severance they had expected. 
 Speaking after a meeting with Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, some former Toys “R” Us workers said they’d been unsuccessful in finding new jobs so far, a task made even more difficult after spending the bulk of their career at the big-box retailer.
