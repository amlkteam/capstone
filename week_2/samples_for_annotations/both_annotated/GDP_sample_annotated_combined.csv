62,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Jacqueline Thorpe and Sandrine Rastello,Setback to Montreal retail reopening shows rocky path to getting economy running again,The high number of COVID-19 cases in Montreal hospitals caused Premier Francois Legault to postpone store openings by a week,-1,,-1,,5/4/2020,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/montreal-retail-setback-shows-canadas-rocky-path-to-reopening?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/quebec.jpg,"Quebec has been forced to dial back plans for reopening its economy, just six days after the premier announced them.The high number of COVID-19 cases in Montreal hospitals caused Premier Francois Legault to postpone store openings by a week in the province’s largest city. Last week he said the city’s retail outlets would be allowed to open May 11; the new date is May 18.Next door in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford indicated he would continue to take a slow approach to restarting Canada’s biggest provincial economy. Ford said the province is getting close to allowing more retail stores to open for curbside pickup — as long as virus cases continue to decline. He didn’t give a date.Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsMeanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com",,,,
63,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Katia Dmitrieva,America’s longest economic expansion is over — and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun,"GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low",-1,,-1,,4/29/2020,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg,"The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com",,,,
64,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Esteban Duarte,Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces,Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government — which could trigger a downgrade,-1,,-1,,4/23/2020,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg,"Canada’s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country’s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada’s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada’s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days.Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.“There is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point” for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.Canadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada’s profile as similar to Australia — whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 — and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada’s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.“The fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low — I think that will be very important for the credit rating,” said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada’s top credit rating as “extremely resilient,” citing the central government’s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is “among the weak” AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn’t an automatic trigger for a credit action.While the federal government doesn’t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador’s rating of A1 by Moody’s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of “a high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,” Moody’s said in an April 1 statement. Moody’s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It’s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.“We still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.“Oil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,” said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That’s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.“Provincials are absolutely key for Canada’s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,” said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces’ credit ratings may be “called into question.”Bloomberg.com",,,,

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF’s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.“This crisis is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. “Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.”As with the virus’s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.“Many countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,” the IMF said. “Risks of a worse outcome predominate.”The grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF’s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that “global growth appears to be bottoming out.” Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund’s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged “more dire scenarios” were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF’s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF’s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com",,,,

The weaker-than-expected print backs up economists’ views that the economy will contract in the first quarter.January’s numbers were slightly affected by the outbreak in China through reduced trade and tourism, Statistics Canada said.Recent monthly GDP numbers do show some signs of recovery from a very weak end to 2019 — with three straight monthly gains between November and January — but that was all before the recent developments.The number will allow economists to fine tune their forecasts for first quarter growth, but expectations are for the quarter to show a contraction.The below-expected January number reinforces those estimates.Bloomberg.com",,,,

There are about 20 more countries interested in support, Georgieva said.The fund also has about US$400 million in its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to help poor countries with debt relief. With the help of donations, like US$195 million recently from the U.K., the IMF hopes to boost that to US$1 billion, she said.“As the virus spreads, the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour,” Georgieva said. “During the global financial crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over US$900 billion in today’s money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.”Georgieva added that the IMF “stands ready to mobilize its US$1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership.” She praised the swap lines announced by central banks on Sunday, saying that going forward there may be a need for swap lines to emerging-market economies.The comments come after Georgieva said earlier this month that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” and that it’s still difficult to predict the economic impact of the virus.

 Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 0.3 per cent -- essentially a stall -- in the three months ended December, in line with economist and Bank of Canada estimates, the federal statistics agency reported Friday. That was down from a revised 1.1 per cent pace in the previous quarter, making it the second-straight quarterly deceleration and slowest pace of growth since 2016. 
 The period ended on a higher note than most analysts anticipated with a monthly expansion of 0.3 per cent in December, the fastest pace of growth since May. This brings the annual growth rate of Canada’s real GDP to 1.6 per cent for 2019, down from two per cent in 2018, and lower than the U.S., which posted a 2.3 per cent increase in real GDP, the agency said. 
 
 The Canadian dollar was down 0.4 per cent to $1.3438 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:37 a.m. Toronto time. Bets that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates at the March 4 meeting rose to more than 50 per cent, from 36 per cent on Thursday. 
 Key Insights 
 -The slowdown in the fourth quarter was largely expected as a series of temporary factors including a week-long rail strike, manufacturing plant disruptions and pipeline shutdowns stunted growth. The quarter started off weak with most of the temporary factors occurring during the first two months of the period. And while December recouped some of the losses, this still doesn’t change the picture that Canada’s economy remains in a fragile position and the Bank of Canada could cut rates, especially in light of the recent impacts from the coronavirus and domestic rail disruptions 
 -The saving grace for the economy was household spending, -- a reflection of a strong labor market -- up two per cent annualized on the quarter. But Canadians are largely buying non-durable goods and services -- which suggests they may be wary of big ticket items. Another indicator of caution is that the household savings rate rose to three per cent in the fourth quarter 
 -Businesses had a tough quarter, perhaps reflecting the heightened global trade tensions at the end of the year. The drop in exports was the biggest downward contributor to 4Q output, falling 5.1 per cent annualized, the biggest drop since 2017. Business investment contracted three per cent in the fourth quarter after an 8.4 per cent expansion in the prior quarter. Investment in machinery and equipment fell 13.5  
 Get More 
 -Supply chain disruptions drove business inventories higher in 4Q, contributing 0.6% to the annualized growth rate. This suggests that if businesses had chosen not to increase inventories, the economy would have contracted. This could potentially drag on 2020 growth if firms decide to meet demand by drawing down stockpiles. 
 -Residential investment decelerated to an annualized pace of 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter from 13 per cent in the prior quarter. Non-residential investment shrunk by an annualized 6.3 per cent, more than offsetting the pickup in capital spending in the third quarter 
 -Overall, domestic demand -- which excludes the trade sector and inventories -- remained sluggish, growing at just 0.7 per cent on an annualized basis 
 -The housing market softened in the 4Q as investment in new construction decelerated 
 -Third quarter GDP was revised down to an annualized 1.1 per cent, from an initial estimate of 1.3 per cent

5,Bloomberg News,Katia Dmitrieva,U.S. fourth-quarter GDP revisions show weaker underlying demand,"Upwardly revised contributions from trade and inventories kept gross domestic product expanding at a solid 2.1 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching estimates for no revision of the initially reported rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday.",-1,,-1,,2/27/2020,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-fourth-quarter-gdp-revisions-show-weaker-underlying-demand-1.1396709,,"Upwardly revised contributions from trade and inventories kept gross domestic product expanding at a solid 2.1 per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching estimates for no revision of the initially reported rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. 
 But consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, was revised down to a 1.7 per cent increase from 1.8 per cent, also matching forecasts. Nonresidential fixed investment was revised lower to a 2.3 per cent drop, representing the third straight decrease and matching the biggest decline since 2015. 
 The report suggests the record-long U.S. expansion is more vulnerable to weakening than previously thought, and it may remain below President Donald Trump's target of three per cent growth as he seeks re-election. Global stocks have been walloped this week and Treasury yields have declined to record lows as the coronavirus spreads and investors fret about its impact on world commerce. 
 Earlier this month, economists had forecast that U.S. growth would slow to 1.5 per cent in the first quarter, amid weaker gains in government spending and only a slight increase in private investment. The record-long expansion is reliant on consumers continuing to open their wallets, particularly as businesses already whipsawed by the U.S.-China trade war start to contend with the coronavirus. 
 While most U.S. data have yet to reflect an impact from the virus, some indicators point to a potential hit to GDP: An IHS Markit output gauge for February fell to the lowest since 2013, led by concern at factories and service providers about lower new orders and demand, and severed supply chains. 
 Brighter Data 
 Another data set from the Commerce Department on Thursday was brighter. Orders for commercial equipment excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- rose 1.1 per cent in January after an upwardly revised 0.5 per cent decrease. Even so, the coronavirus will test demand as well as supply chains. 
 A key measure of underlying demand -- final sales to domestic purchasers -- rose an annualized 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, revised from an initially reported 1.6 per cent and the weakest in a year. 
 Net exports contributed an upwardly revised 1.53 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth, while inventories dragged down the headline figure by 0.98 point, less than initially reported. 
 A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits rose for a third week, though they remain low by historical standards. Jobless claims increased to 219,000 in the week ended Feb. 22, above economist forecasts. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, edged up to 209,750. 
 The claims figures tend to be more volatile around holidays. Last week included the Presidents Day holiday.

That follows a rapid increase in cases from Italy to Iran and Japan, with a growing list of companies warning that profits will suffer as economies around the world suffer. The S&P, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite indexes all set record highs this month.Wall Street’s three major stock indexes fell 3 per cent as the coronavirus spread further around the world and officials described it as “a rapidly escalating epidemic,” a day after the S&P 500 and the Dow Industrials’ biggest daily decline in two years. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to a record low of 1.3055 per cent as investors sought shelter from the virus’s impact on the outlook for growth. All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 fell with energy, material and financial shares leading the declines. Volatility spiked, sending the Cboe’s measure of equity gyrations surging past 30 for the first time since 2018.“The market is pricing in a significant slowdown in GDP and a 10 per cent impact on earnings,” said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “And since no one knows how bad the infection will be, it is hard to make a bet on economy.”U.S. central bankers are closely monitoring the spreading coronavirus, but it is “still too soon” to say whether it will result a material change to the outlook, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said.Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 880.79 points, or 3.15 per cent, to 27,080.01, the S&P 500 lost 97.59 points, or 3.03 per cent, to 3,128.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 255.67 points, or 2.77 per cent, to 8,965.61.The TSX fell 385.37 points, or 2.19 per cent to 17,177.37.Elsewhere, European stocks closed in the red, while bonds from the region were mixed.

 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate for a second straight quarter, according to Commerce Department data Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 2 per cent growth. 
 Consumer spending decelerated to a 1.8 per cent pace, below projections and the weakest since the first quarter. Business investment declined for a third straight period, the longest stretch since the last recession. 
 A closely watched gauge of underlying demand grew at the slowest rate of the year. So-called final sales to domestic purchasers, which exclude the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, expanded 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Excluding government purchases, final sales advanced just 1.4 per cent, the weakest in four years. 
 Bigger cutbacks in business investment remain a risk if they translate into weaker job gains and slower consumer spending, and the suspension of production for Boeing Co.’s 737 Max is set to weigh on the economy at least through the first half. Nonetheless, healthy job creation, cheap borrowing costs and signs of stabilization in global manufacturing after trade agreements between the U.S. and its biggest trading partners suggest growth will hold up. 
 Slower consumption growth is consistent with the message from Federal Reserve policy makers. The Fed, in a statement Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting, softened its characterization of household spending growth to “moderate’’ from “strong’’ as “business fixed investment and exports remain weak.’’ 
 Fed Forecast 
 The fourth-quarter GDP figures are consistent with the Fed’s two per cent growth forecast for 2020, indicating policy makers can hold the line on interest rates after three reductions in 2019. 
 Full-year GDP grew 2.3 per cent in 2019, slower than the 2.5 per cent in 2018. Economists expect growth to further moderate in 2020, as the waning effects of tax cuts and cooling wage gains make achieving Donald Trump’s goal of sustained thre per cent economic expansion difficult in the late-stage expansion. 
 Business investment declined an annualized 1.5 per cent after falling at a 2.3 per cent  pace in the previous three months. Spending on structures and equipment continued to weaken. 
 At the same time, a pickup in home building helped soften the blow. Residential construction outlays increased at a 5.8 per cent rate, the strongest in two years and following a 4.6 per cent advance in the third quarter. 
 Trade Boost 
 A narrowing in the trade deficit -- largely due to a sharp drop in imports amid the U.S.-China trade war -- gave a significant boost to the main GDP number. Net exports added 1.48 percentage points to growth, the most since 2009. That helped to offset a 1.09 percentage point drag from inventories. 
 Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the quarter, well below policy makers’ two per cent objective. 
 A separate Labor Department report out Thursday showed initial filings for unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 to 216,000 in the week ended Jan. 25. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, decreased to 214,500. The historically-low figure suggests a solid labor market. 
 The third-quarter figures will be revised in February and March as additional source data are compiled.

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement passed the House in December on a bipartisan 385-41 vote the day after the Democratic-led chamber voted to impeach Trump.The Senate vote is also moving in tandem with the impeachment process, coming just a few hours before Chief Justice John Roberts is sworn in to preside over the trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded the trade deal as a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation.“A major win for our country. A major win for the Trump administration. A major win for those of us who are ready to move past this season of toxic political noise and get back to doing even more of the American people’s business,“ McConnell said on the Senate floor.Democrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, finally got behind the trade agreement in December after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration over changes to provisions regarding labor, the environment, pharmaceuticals and the overall enforcement of the deal. The changes won over Democratic senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren who criticized previous free trade deals.Some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, still opposed the deal because it doesn’t explicitly mention climate change.“Despite the fact that it includes very good labour provisions, I am voting against USMCA because it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet,” Schumer said in a statement before the vote.A handful of free-trade conservatives like Pennsylvania GOP Senator Pat Toomey also voted against the agreement for creating new wage requirements in the auto industry, among other market interventions.McConnell initially said the Senate wouldn’t act on the USMCA until it had finished with Trump’s impeachment trial, but Pelosi’s decision to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate created a window for the vote this week. The Senate Finance Committee and six other panels rushed to approve the deal since lawmakers returned from their holiday recess last week.Passing this revision of the North America Free Trade Agreement gives Trump a victory to tout in his election-year State of the Union address scheduled for Feb. 4. While the USMCA is projected to add just 0.35 per cent to GDP after six years, signing this agreement and the first phase of a China trade deal will relieve some economic uncertainty, helping Trump’s pitch to voters based on the strength of the U.S. economy.For Democrats from narrowly divided or Republican-leaning districts, the USMCA allows them to show constituents that they’re working with the president and doing more than impeaching him. They have highlighted the labor enforcement provisions as a model for future free trade agreements.Bloomberg.com",,,,
8,Bloomberg News,,China's economy grew 6% in fourth quarter as demand stabilized,"China’s economy stabilized last quarter after slowing to the weakest pace in almost three decades, with the first acceleration in investment since June signaling that a firmer recovery could be underway.",1,,1,,1/16/2020,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-economy-grew-6-in-fourth-quarter-as-demand-stabilized-1.1375362,,"China’s economy stabilized last quarter after slowing to the weakest pace in almost three decades, with the first acceleration in investment since June signaling that a firmer recovery could be underway. 
 
 Gross domestic product rose 6 per cent in the final quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, the same as in the previous three-month period and the median estimate 
 Fixed-asset investment rose 5.4 per cent in the year, increasing its pace in the final month particularly through a jump in manufacturing expenditure 
 
 The world’s second-largest economy expanded by 6.1 per cent in 2019, slower than 6.6 per cent the previous year but in line with the government’s target. The signing of the phase-one trade deal with the U.S. this week combined with recovering global demand has improved the outlook for Chinese factories and exporters in 2020, though uncertain implementation of that deal and domestic financial fragility remain risks. 
 
 Chinese stocks inched higher and the offshore yuan gained, trading at US$6.8715 at 10:48 a.m. in Shanghai. 
 Industrial output rose 6.9 per cent in December from the same period the previous year, versus the median forecast of 5.9 per cent. Some of that may be due to the effects of Chinese New Year. That holiday is earlier this year than in 2019, and companies may have increased production in December ahead of a shutdown later this month. Retail sales rose eight per cent versus an estimate of 7.9 per cent. 
 “The latest GDP and IP data provides a very positive start to the Chinese New Year for China’s economy,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore. “The outlook for 2020 is for continued robust growth, boosted by the Phase One trade deal with the U.S. and the continued positive impact of government monetary and fiscal policy stimulus measures.” 
 The surveyed unemployment rate ticked up to 5.2 per cent in December from 5.1 per cent, signaling that the manufacturing-led slowdown in 2019 may be filtering through to the labor market. 
 What Bloomberg’s Economists Say... 
 Stronger-than-expected activity in December points to further stabilization in early 2020. The signing of the ‘phase-one’ trade deal takes China out of the most turbulent waters, but it will hardly be smooth sailing ahead -- sizable U.S. tariffs will continue to weigh on the external sector, and sentiment is weak. 
 Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics 
 About 58 per cent of China’s growth in 2019 was due to consumption, with investment adding 31 per cent and the remaining 11 per cent from net exports, Statistics Bureau head Ning Jizhe told journalists after the data was released Friday in Beijing. That contribution of consumption was lower than in 2018, indicating that efforts to rebalance the economy away from reliance on an investment-led model still have a way to go. 
 One factor in that is likely to be the weak growth in incomes in 2019. Per capita incomes grew 5.8 per cent in the year, below the 6 per cent real growth of the economy. The slower growth in real incomes was partly due to higher inflation, according to Ning, who said he expects personal income and consumption to continue growing this year. 
 Long-Run Uncertainty 
 Policy makers have signaled they are prioritizing economic stability in 2020, with stimulus to be kept basically unchanged. Data released Thursday showed that overall credit growth held up in December and a gauge of borrowing costs fell, indicating that policy makers are beginning to see some progress in channeling credit to the economy. 
 “All we can say is that China’s economy is stabilizing. It’s hard to forecast if the trend will continue in 2020 and if there will be a rebound,” said Betty Wang, senior economist at Australia &New Zealand Banking Group. “The trade deal provided some short-term support for the economy, but there still exists great uncertainty in the long run.” 
 The number of births per 1000 people declined to 10.48, the lowest level on record according to National Bureau of Statistics data going back to 1949 when the Communist Party took power. China’s working-age population -- thoseaged 15 to 59 -- declined by 890,000, the figures released Friday showed. The number of newborns in 2019 fell to 14.65 million, a decrease of 580,000 from the year before. 
 That underlines the longer-term challenges that the economy faces, from demographics to an increasingly heavy debt load. Policy settings agreed by the top leadership last month are due to be signed off by the nation’s legislature in March. 
 For now, officials remain wary of boosting monetary stimulus and are focusing on the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Economists see the growth target for 2020 being set at “about 6 per cent,” signaling an acceptance of the long-term slowdown that the nation is on. 
 December’s data provides support to the argument that the current policy mix is the right one, according to Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. 
 “Retail sales growth were steady, indicating still pretty resilient consumers despite growing downward pressure on the labor market,” she said. “This, together with the “phase one” deal, surely reduces the downside risks to the economy for 2020, offering comfort to policy-makers to stick with a measured easing approach.”

Forecasters see it benefiting from an improving global economic outlook and fading political tensions.Betting on euro gains is among Morgan Stanley’s top trades for the new year, a view shared by analysts at UBS Wealth Management and Credit Agricole, among others. Options markets also signal improved confidence in the common currency, which touched a one-week high Friday as broad risk sentiment picked up on signs of improving U.S.-China trade relations.“Euro-dollar is particularly sensitive to global growth upgrades,” said Stephen Innes, strategist at Axitrader Limited. “With trade optimism swinging positively for global growth, the euro’s trend-following dynamics could start to argue for a push above.”The euro climbed as high as $1.1150 Friday, its strongest since Dec. 18.

The one-month measure, which covers the next European Central Bank decision on Jan. 23, was at 20 basis points.The euro wrong-footed markets this year by falling against a surprisingly resilient dollar, when it was forecast to rally around 5%. Fears that the U.S.-led tariff war with China could spread to Europe, concerns around Brexit and an overall subdued outlook for the global economy weighed on the shared currency. While Danske Bank’s Jens Peter Sorensen also sees the euro “slowly move” toward $1.15 by the end of 2020, he cautions on being overly optimistic amid accommodative ECB monetary policies.“We have a fairly benign view on the euro with it range-trading in the first quarter versus the dollar,” Sorensen, Danske’s chief analyst, said. “Even though we have the first steps toward both a trade deal and an orderly Brexit as well as some signs of a stabilization in the global economy, this fragile recovery needs plenty of stimulus. especially in Europe.”What to Watch:U.S. fixed income markets close early at 14:00 EST on Dec. 31; most global markets closed on Jan. 1 for New Year’s DayU.S. Fed’s FOMC minutes released Jan. 3Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly participate on a panel discussing global economic outlook (Jan. 3)Economic releases include:U.S. wholesale inventories, pending home sales, MNI Chicago PMI, Spain GDP, CPI (Dec. 30); U.S. FHFA house price index, consumer confidence, China manufacturing/non-manufacturing PMI (Dec. 31); U.S. jobless claims, Markit PMI manufacturing for countries/regions including Canada, U.S., Germany, Euro-area, U.K. (Jan. 2); U.S. construction spending, ISM manufacturing, France CPI, Germany unemployment, CPI, U.K. consumer credit (Jan. 3) Bloomberg.com",,,,

 Overall, 13 of 20 sectors posted increases, suggesting the weakness was largely isolated to a few key industries. 
 The Canadian currency was weaker after the report, declining 0.1 per cent to $1.3163 against the U.S. dollar at 8:41 a.m. Toronto time. 
 Key Insights 
 • Although the slowdown was expected following disappointing reports for the month across wholesale, factory and retail sales, October’s GDP result will make it harder for the Canadian economy to reach the Bank of Canada’s 4Q forecast of 1.3 per cent annualized 
 • Broad-based declines in manufacturing were the largest downside contributor with a 2.5 per cent contraction in the transportation equipment subsector; that’s due in part to the auto strike which caused some Canadian plants and parts producers to scale back 
 
 Get More 
 • Other weak points include retail trade down 1.1 per cent in October, the largest decline since March 2016 and wholesale trade, down one per cent on the month 
 • Spots of strength include real estate, the largest upside contributor, with agents and brokers up 0.7 per cent on gains in Vancouver and Ottawa. Transportation and warehousing grew 0.6 per cebt in October with eight of the nine subsectors up; The professional services sector expanded 0.3% on the month led by growth in computer systems design and related services 
 • On an annual basis, Canada’s economy grew 1.2 per cent in October, missing forecasts for 1.4 per cent, and down from a revised 1.5 per cent in September

In Canada, they can bank on population growth.The flood of immigrants and non-permanent residents to levels not seen in a century has been one of the main drivers supporting Canada’s economic expansion over the past several years. That has kept the Bank of Canada as an outlier in the global easing trend as it held its policy rate unchanged, bolstering the allure of the loonie.“These high levels of immigration — if they are to continue and help support growth — are actually supportive of a Canadian dollar over time,” Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said in an interview in Toronto.The country’s population grew by 208,234 in the July to September period, or 0.6 per cent, the fastest quarterly increase since at least 1971. Some 83 per cent of that increase is due to international migration, according to estimates from Statistics Canada released Thursday in Ottawa. Over the past year, Canada’s population has jumped by almost 560,000, an increase of 1.5 per cent — that’s the fastest annual pace since 1990.“This is the story I think markets are missing: how powerful immigration is at actually changing your financial markets, particularly your rates and FX,” Donald said.The Canadian dollar is on pace to take the No. 1 spot among its Group-of-10 counterparts this year, strengthening by about 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar.Canada’s population boom has driven robust gains in the housing and labour markets, countering the effect of an aging demographic. This has helped to avoid the Japanification trap of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates that are slowly becoming evident in other parts of the world.This is the story I think markets are missing: how powerful immigration is at actually changing your financial markets“What’s fascinating about the story however, from a strategist, like myself, is not even how it relates to GDP growth but how we’re substituting one form of policy for another,” Donald said.While Donald argues immigration can be a proxy for monetary policy, currency strategists say the central bank is still the main driver of the loonie, and immigration is more of a long-term variable that can influence policy.“Immigration informs the output gap and hence policy stance,” wrote Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. “FX will react to how the Bank changes policy.”Case in point, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has cited the country’s robust labour force, supported by new entrants, as a reason for holding interest rates despite concerns around a slowdown.Relying on human capital to improve growth and inflation numbers over time actually acts as a curve steepener, Donald added. “If we rely on this so called human stimulus then we don’t have to rely on monetary policy to the same extent.”Bloomberg.com",,,,
12,Bloomberg News,Theophilos Argitis,Canada's economy slows even as business investment perks up,"Canada’s economy slowed sharply in the third quarter, as a drop in exports and draw down in business inventories masked a rebound in domestic demand.",-1,,-1,,11/29/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-economy-slows-even-as-business-investment-perks-up-1.1355209,,"Canada’s economy slowed sharply in the third quarter, as a drop in exports and draw down in business inventories masked a rebound in domestic demand. 
 Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.3 per cent in the three months ended September, in line with economist estimates, Statistics Canada reported Friday. That was down from a revised 3.5 per cent pace in the previous quarter that was largely seen as unsustainable. The period also ended as expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.1 per cent in September. 
 While the slowdown last quarter marks a return to sluggish growth for the Canadian economy, the details of the report should provide some optimism about underlying strength domestically, even in the face of a weak trade sector, aided by a relatively robust jobs market and a rebound in housing. 
 Residential investment increased at an annualized pace of 13.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest since 2012. Growth in household consumption picked up to an annualized pace of 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, from 0.5 per cent the previous quarter. 
 Non-residential business investment also surprised -- given the global trade uncertainties -- with spending on non-residential structures and machinery up 9.5 per cent. That fully recouped a drop in the second quarter. 
 
 The end result was a 3.2 per cent increase in overall domestic demand, fully rebounding from a very weak second quarter when consumption slowed and investment contracted. These underlying details should give Bank of Canada policy makers pause about cutting rates to counter an expected slowdown. Swaps trading suggests investors are placing a two-thirds chance of a rate cut in the first half of next year. The Canadian dollar pared losses after the report, and was trading at $1.33 per U.S. dollar at 8:39 a.m. in Toronto trading. 
 The “hearty” gains in final domestic demand will “for now reinforce the Bank of Canada’s view that they have rates low enough to offset the drag from weak external markets,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors. “Overall, a mixed bag, but perhaps a bit better than it looks in the headline given the strength in domestic demand.” 
 The Bank of Canada, whose next rate decision is Dec. 4, had forecast growth of 1.3 per cent annualized for the third and fourth quarters this year, before the expansion picks up a bit in 2020. 
 Revisions 
 Another bit of good news was upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada to gross domestic product that showed the economy was slightly larger than initially estimated last year. This suggests there was less slack in the economy than previously thought, one less reason for the Bank of Canada to cut. 
 The biggest drag on the economy in the third quarter was a draw down in inventories by business to meet demand, instead of raising production. That’s the second straight draw down in inventories, and may still reflect concerns about the outlook. 
 At the same time, fewer inventories will ease worries that stockpiles had grown too large, posing a risk to future growth. 
 Exports dropped at an annualized pace of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, falling for a third time in the past four quarters. 
 Households also seem to be repairing their balance sheets, with the country’s savings rate jumping to the highest since 2015 in the third quarter.

13,Bloomberg News,Erik Hertzberg,Canada's economy faces a prolonged period of sluggish growth,Canada’s economy is shifting into a lower gear as some of the country’s growth drivers begin to lose steam.,-1,,-1,,11/28/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-economy-faces-a-prolonged-period-of-sluggish-growth-1.1354812,,"Canada’s economy is shifting into a lower gear as some of the country’s growth drivers begin to lose steam. 
 Statistics Canada will release third-quarter gross domestic product numbers Friday that will probably show a sharp drop in growth. According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country’s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent in the prior period. 
 It’s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation’s households cope with high debt levels. 
 Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn’t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That’s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January. 
 Canada’s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they’ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3  per cent since June in volume terms.

 Consumption has long propelled Canada’s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that’s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigor is most apparent in a retail sector that’s seen volumes flat over the past year.

 Output grew 0.1 per cent in August, missing economist expectations of a 0.2 per cent gain, Statistics Canada said Thursday in Ottawa. The slight growth in August follows a flat GDP reading in July. 
 The expansion was broad-based, with 14 of 20 sectors expanding. Manufacturing was the biggest contributor to the monthly expansion, up 0.5 per cent, while wholesale trade was the biggest drag. 
 The latest GDP reading bolsters the view that Canada is not immune to global weakness and is impacted by overall uncertainty in the economy. It also reinforces the Bank of Canada’s decision on Wednesday to keep rates unchanged for the eighth consecutive meeting, though policy makers signaled they are leaving the door open for a rate cut in December. 
 
 Key Insights 
 
 The August GDP result is broadly in line with the idea that Canada’s economy will decelerate in the third quarter from the robust 3.7 per cent growth in the prior period 
 It’s the second print of the quarter and although it surprised to the downside, the result marked the first monthly GDP acceleration since March 
 Wholesale sales, the biggest drag on monthly GDP, dropped 1.3 per cent in August, off-setting growth from the prior month. Declines in the category were broad-based with six of nine subsectors contracting

 Gross domestic product was unchanged in July from a 0.2 per cent gain in June, Statistics Canada said Tuesday from Ottawa. The figure missed a 0.1 per cent gain expected in a Bloomberg Survey of economists. A drop in oil and gas extraction was the main contributor to the slowdown in GDP, falling 3 per cent in July, the largest monthly decline since 2016. 
 The latest GDP reading may stoke worries about a sharper than expected slowdown in the second half of the year, and increase pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut rates. While Canada saw growth accelerate in the second quarter to an annualized pace of 3.7 per cent, some of the strength was temporary. There are also worries mounting global economic uncertainty is beginning to weigh on Canada’s economic expansion. 
 
 Key Insights 
 -It’s the first print of the third quarter and the result surprised to the downside, and was the fourth straight month growth either decelerated or was flat 
 -A slowdown in mining, quarry and oil and gas extraction was responsible for the majority of the decline, contracting 3.5 per cent in July; the largest decrease for the industry since May 2016 
 -The decrease was isolated to 7 of the 20 sectors recording lower output 
 Get More 
 -The shutdown of some of Newfoundland and Labrador’s offshore production facilities for maintenance issues negatively impacted oil and natural gas activity in July 
 -Other sectors contributing to the month’s weak figures include manufacturing, down for the second straight month, and construction 
 -Positive additions to GDP were wholesale trade, which rose 1.1 per cent, led by personal goods and motor vehicles 
 -On an aggregate basis, goods-producing industries dropped 0.7 per cent, the second consecutive decline, while services-producing sectors repeated June’s expansion, rising 0.3 per cent 
 -On an annual basis, output rose 1.3 per cent in July

The prime minister’s critics, however, say the Liberals have been spending too much in good times and aren’t setting enough fiscal ammunition aside for when a recession hits.Under the Liberal plan, Canada’s deficit would peak at $27.4 billion next year, bringing it above 1 per cent of GDP for the first time since 2012, before dropping to $21 billion by 2023. That far exceeds the $14 billion deficit recorded in 2018. In total, the plan would add an additional $31.5 billion in deficits and bring the cumulative budget gap over the next four years to $93 billion.Politically, the Liberals hope the higher deficits will give them a potential wedge issue in a campaign where the two major parties have rolled out similar policy objectives — from tax cuts to helping first time home buyers and seniors. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has yet to release his full fiscal projection but has promised to eventually return the budget to balance, though only over five years.In fact, given Scheer’s reluctance for a quick return to balance, both the Liberal and Conservative plans are poised to deliver a boost to the economy next year, no matter who wins. It’s perhaps even enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider cutting interest rates, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.“It seems clear whoever is in power, you are looking at a bigger deficit than had there not been an election,” Perrault said in a telephone interview.Opinion polls show the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives, despite Trudeau’s campaign being jolted by revelations he wore black and brownface makeup numerous times as a younger man. Seat projections tabulated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show neither party holding enough support to win a majority.Deficits matter in Canada, with a collective aversion to debt that was cemented in the mid-1990s amid ratings agency downgrades, a falling currency and a national unity crisis. It remains an explosive issue, even though Trudeau’s deficits have hovered at less than 1 per cent of GDP, far below many other western nations. The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada’s budget would be back in balance.Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he’s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.“I will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity — if they really think so — are going to help Canadians,” Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.Trudeau’s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation’s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory — but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That’s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years’ time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada’s AAA credit rating.There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional $2 billion as early as next year by undertaking “a new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.”They also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion. It would take effect April 1 and be expected to raise more than $500 million next year. The Liberals also plan to impose a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars and boats worth more than $100,000.Bloomberg.com",,,,

A strong run of economic data affords policy makers opportunity to resist — as they have so far — the dovish turn in global policy. But escalating tensions between China and the U.S., and their spillover into Canada, are getting tougher to overlook, particularly given how they’ve already become a major reason behind global factory weakness.“The truth of the matter is, if you go back really over the last month and a half, the domestic picture hasn’t change in Canada,” said Mark Chandler, head of fixed-income research at Royal Bank of Canada, who sees a rate cut in January. “Trade risks have increased but we really don’t know at this stage to what degree they’ve altered the outlook for the bank.”Complicating matters is that the Bank of Canada hasn’t made any public comments since its last rate decision on July 10. Wednesday’s decision is a statement-only affair. The next day, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will give a speech in Halifax to provide more details on the central bank’s deliberations around the decision.Swaps trading suggests investors are fully pricing in a cut by December, with strong odds of a second by this time next year. Odds for a rate cut on Wednesday are less than 10 per cent.Even two cuts over the next 12 months would still leave Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies — raising the question of whether the domestic outlook truly justifies the northern nation’s outlier status.While Canada’s expansion is hardly remarkable, it stands out by virtue of having largely weathered the recent global slowdown. After a sluggish start to the year, growth in Canada accelerated to a strong 3.7 per cent annualized pace in the second quarter, giving it a very decent 2.1 per cent performance for the first half.Canada’s housing market, meanwhile, is recovering; inflation is at target; and wage gains are accelerating. The Canadian data are hardly screaming rate cut.Nor are forecasts overly gloomy.Economists, including those at the central bank, continue to see growth averaging more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, which outside of the U.S. is as good as it gets in the Group of Seven.Of course, the Bank of Canada could mark down its forecasts for exports and investment, and the second-quarter GDP numbers also raised concerns about the underlying strength of consumption. But without a global recession, the base case will continue to call for half-decent growth, tempering the need for rate cuts.Yet, the one thing Poloz has practiced as governor is a reluctance to put too much weight on base case projections. He adopted a risk management framework in 2013 — well before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — that essentially moved the focus away from pinpoint forecasts to thinking about what could produce unexpected deviations. It’s a play-it-safe strategy.When conditions were calling for rates to go up, risk management took the form of hyper data dependency. Policy makers were worried that more expensive credit could trigger an unwanted downturn so they were willing to go slow with hikes, waiting for the data to reaffirm their analysis.Now, with downside risks at the forefront and conditions suggesting cuts are in order, waiting may no longer be the best type of risk management strategy. Which is why Poloz, in the middle of the oil price shock in 2015, cut interest rates at the time. He called it an insurance cut, much like Powell’s rationale for the Fed’s last move.Bloomberg.com",,,,

The only other months with negative returns over the same period were October, June and January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Don’t write off September just yet though, as the month has had its share of gains. The index has risen six of the last 10 Septembers, though massive declines in 2011, 2014 and 2015 pushed the average lower.Investors can be forgiven for wanting to see August behind them. Global trade tensions roiled markets throughout the month, leading to wild swings amid the China-U.S. showdown. After all the noise however, the benchmark climbed 0.2 per cent for the month, after the best weekly gain since January as energy and mining stocks rallied with commodities.Further along the Canadian equity train ride, the next stop is ‘Hobnob Station.’Investors will head to conferences in Toronto and New York to hear from senior executives of major Canadian companies about their growth plans and the state of their industries. There will also be plenty of time for dinners, drinks and one-on-one meetings.In Toronto, two events stand out:Scotiabank Financials Summit (Sept. 4-5): Presenters include C-Suite executives of the Big Six banks, life insurers like Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., and private equity firm Onex Corp.Toronto Global Forum (Sept. 4-6): Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci — who has set up a political action committee in a bid to prevent Donald Trump’s re-election — will speak along with the CEOs of various Canadian corporations and Canadian provincial and federal ministers.For Manhattan, investors are set to gather at the Sheraton Times Square Hotel for Barclays’ annual CEO Energy-Power conference, where majors like Suncor Energy Inc. will make presentations.There’s one major event that will have economists and market participants on edge: Bank of Canada’s rate decision day on Sept. 4. While most expect no rate change, Governor Stephen Poloz’s comments on monetary policy will be watched closely, especially after GDP expanded 3.7 per cent in the second quarter, beating the 3 per cent estimate. Investors are betting on a rate cut in October, based on trading in the swaps market.Here’s a recap of what happened last week.Canada recorded its largest inflow of foreign direct investment in four years, another sign global trade tensions haven’t reduced the appetite for investing into the Canadian economy. That included Newmont Mining Corp.’s $10 billion takeover of Goldcorp Inc. earlier this year.August employment figures are expected on Sept. 6.Bloomberg.com",,,,
17,Bloomberg News,Theophilos Argitis,Consumer worries cloud best Canadian output gain in two years,"Canada’s economy recorded a stronger-than-expected rebound in the second quarter as exports recovered, but surprisingly weak consumption and business investment will cast doubts on the expansion’s sustainability.",1,stronger-than-expected balanced out?,0,Worries seems more important than economic growth,8/30/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/consumer-worries-cloud-best-canadian-output-gain-in-two-years-1.1309204,,"Canada’s economy recorded a stronger-than-expected rebound in the second quarter as exports recovered, but surprisingly weak consumption and business investment will cast doubts on the expansion’s sustainability. 
 Output grew at an annualized pace of 3.7 per cent in the three months through June, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, up from a paltry 0.5 per cent increase in the first quarter. The rebound follows two straight quarters of hardly any growth. The period also ended better than expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.2 per cent in June. 
 The underlying details, however, were less impressive. The rebound was driven by the fastest quarterly increase in exports since 2014, but growth in household consumption came to a near halt despite strong gains in incomes, and business investment shrank by the most in more than two years. As a result, domestic demand contracted in the second quarter. 
 That could be a signal of growing unease among households and businesses about global economic conditions, fueled by concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and potentially foreshadowing a sharper slowdown in the second half of the year. Policy makers at the Bank of Canada may look through some of the strength in the report.

 GDP report sheds new light on cannabis demand 
 David George-Cosh digs into the cannabis data that was in the latest GDP report. 
 
 “This was a ‘less than meets the eye’ report,” Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note to investors. “Not only were today’s details weak, but since the second quarter ended we’ve seen yet another escalation in the trade wars and associated uncertainty.” 
 Possibly reflecting concerns about the outlook, businesses met some of the pickup in foreign demand by drawing down inventories, rather than boosting production. The strong gain in exports, meanwhile, is seen as only temporary, reflecting a ramping up of shipments after a sluggish winter. Exports had slumped sharply earlier this year because of curtailments on oil production and other temporary issues, prompting many businesses to stockpile. 
 DePratto said he expects the Bank of Canada to join the global trend toward easing monetary policy in October, an increasingly likely scenario according to swaps trading. A second cut is being priced in by investors sometime next year. The next rate decision is Sept. 4, when policy makers aren’t expected to move but will likely strike a more dovish tone. Friday’s GDP numbers beat the bank’s 2.3 per cent forecast, and economists had predicted a 3 per cent increase. 
 The stronger-than-expected headline figure boosted the Canadian dollar. The loonie was up 0.2 per cent to $1.3255 per U.S. dollar at 10:04 a.m. in Toronto. 
 
 ‘Solid Increase’ 
 Despite the worrying details, the Canadian economic expansion in the second quarter was still impressive -- growing the most in two years at easily the fastest pace in the Group of Seven. The U.S. economy expanded by an annualized 2 per cent over the same period. 
 Shipments by Canadian exporters rose at a 13 per cent pace, contributing more than 4 percentage points to growth. A drop in imports also added to the expansion, as more of the nation’s demand was used to buy domestically produced goods and services. 
 Housing investment, meanwhile, recorded its first gain in six quarters. 
 It’s the sort of data that make the case for cheaper money less compelling in Canada than it is elsewhere. Even two cuts over the next 12 months will still leave the country with the highest policy rate among advanced economies. 
 “The solid increase in the headline numbers leaves our call intact for the Bank of Canada to remain patient on cutting rates for the next few month,” said Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which expects a cut in January.

More than 60 per cent of companies listed on the benchmark have posted declines this month. Canadian stocks have been caught in the crosshairs of erratic market behaviour and have lost a total of $97 billion of value.On Monday morning, at least, bulls were back in charge, with the TSX climbing 0.7 per cent as of 9:53 a.m. in Toronto. The picture brightened after U.S. President Donald Trump said the prospects for a deal with China were better now than at any time since negotiations began last year, even as a top state-media editor in Beijing questioned his version of events.Market winds for the rest of the week will probably move with prospects for the fight between the world’s largest economies, and that will depend on whichever way Trump blows them.“It’s ridiculous what’s going on out there,” Andrew McCreath, chief executive officer at Forge First Asset Management Inc., said Monday on BNN Bloomberg TV. “We were way down last night, we’re up decently this morning. All because Trump tweets away and meanwhile China doesn’t say very much.”Other factors could intervene. In Canada, there’s still four of the Big 6 banks that have yet to report earnings and the week’s major economic data release — quarterly GDP — could have big implications for the Bank of Canada and local markets.“Canada’s calendar is empty today but bank earnings and a single macro report plus a bond auction will mildly heat things up over the duration of the week,” Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said in an Aug. 26 report.Buckle up as volatility remains.

Economists were expecting a 0.3 per cent decline.Excluding sales at gasoline stations and car dealerships, retail sales climbed 1.7 per cent, the most since January 2017, aided by the Toronto Raptors’ playoff run.In volume terms, sales were up 0.4 per cent in June, better than what has been typical of late and a stronger-than-expected end to the second quarter.Friday’s retail report is the last bit of economic data for the second quarter, with GDP numbers due Aug. 30. The retail numbers are likely to reinforce expectations that second quarter GDP growth was near 3 per cent on an annualized basis, probably enough to keep the central bank on the sidelines for now.“The decent finish to the quarter gives some momentum for Q3, a reason why we see the Bank of Canada delaying a rate cut for several more months,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said in a note to investors.Even with the flat June results, Canada’s retail sector was able to eke out half decent gains in the second quarter with sales up 1.2 per cent in nominal terms and volumes up 0.1 per cent.Canadian retailers have been in a bit of a slump for more than a year. Volume sales remain below records hit earlier last year. While the second quarter increase in volumes was small, it was the first gain since the third quarter of 2018.The Toronto Raptors playoff run seems to have given a boost to June numbers, helping sales at clothing retailers, sporting goods stores and bars. The Raptors won their first National Basketball Association title in June. Sales of Raptors championship apparel and memorabilia on NBA.com broke the record for the day following a title, topping LeBron James’s 2016 victory with his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.Receipts at gas stations fell 3.4 per cent, largely on falling prices.Car and parts dealerships recorded a 2.5 per cent decline in sales, mostly on lower volumes.Building materials and gardening equipment gained 6 per cent in June, helped by improving weather during the month.Bloomberg.com",,,,

 Gross domestic product rose 0.2 per cent, after a 0.3 per cent gain in April, Statistics Canada said Wednesday from Ottawa. The figure topped the 0.1 per cent gain expected in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
 The result will relieve pressure on the Bank of Canada to follow other central banks in easing policy. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates for the first time in a decade later on Wednesday. 
 Canada’s currency appreciated after the report, reversing an earlier loss and trading 0.2 per cent higher at $1.3130 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:32 a.m. in Toronto. 
 Key Insights 
 
 The better-than-expected result will support estimates for second-quarter growth closer to 3 per cent, versus the 2.3 per cent predicted by the Bank of Canada at its latest rate decision this month. 
 Wednesday’s report shows Canada’s recovery continues apace, after growth virtually stalled at the end of last year. May’s gain caps the strongest three-month increase since the middle of 2017. 
 After oil production led the expansion in March and April, the story in May was more about manufacturing, which climbed 1.2 per cent, and construction, up 0.9 per cent.

 Real estate showed strong gains, supporting the narrative of a recovering housing market, with the agents and brokers subcategory up 4.8 per cent in May, the fourth gain in five months. 
 The gains were relatively broad-based, as 13 out of 20 sectors recorded higher output. 
 In a separate report, Statistics Canada said industrial product prices fell 1.4 per cent in June, versus an estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 0.2 per cent drop. Prices for raw materials fell 5.9 per cent, compared with a forecast of a three decline.

20,Bloomberg News,Katia Dmitrieva,U.S. growth slows to 2.1% as trade tensions weigh on businesses,"U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter by less than forecast as consumer spending topped estimates, though weaker business investment and exports underscored the risks spurring the Federal Reserve toward an interest-rate cut next week.",-1,,-1,,7/26/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-growth-slows-to-2-1-as-trade-tensions-weigh-on-businesses-1.1292995,,"U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter by less than forecast as consumer spending topped estimates, though weaker business investment and exports underscored the risks spurring the Federal Reserve toward an interest-rate cut next week. 
 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped forecasts for 1.8 per cent. That follows an unrevised 3.1 per cent advance in first quarter and updated data showing growth last year was slower than previously reported. 
 Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, increased 4.3 per cent, while government spending climbed 5 per cent and offered the biggest boost in a decade. Nonresidential investment fell 0.6 per cent for the first drop since 2015 and residential decreased for a sixth straight period. 
 The mixed report highlights how President Donald Trump -- who's repeatedly called for lower interest rates -- is enjoying signs of a solid economy while his trade war with China weighs on the expansion and fuels uncertainty for global businesses. Revised data released Friday showed the economy missed Trump's 3 per cent growth goal in 2018, after previous data had showed it matching. 
 Friday’s report showed fresh evidence that trade is weighing on the expansion as exports dropped 5.2 per cent while imports rose just 0.1 per cent. Overall growth on a year-over-year basis slowed to 2.3 per cent, the weakest pace in two years. 
 Economic Risks 
 The report on the broadest measure of all goods and services comes as Fed is expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter point. The GDP report isn’t likely to sway that outcome, though officials are likely to consider the weakness in trade and corporate investment as risks to the economic outlook. 
 Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 3.5 per cent pace, the best in a year. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. Inventories were a drag on growth, subtracting 0.86 point from growth after a 0.53 point contribution in the prior period. 
 The Fed's preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, firmed to a 1.8 per cent annual pace in the quarter, closer to policy makers' 2 per cent objective. 
 The expansion, which this month became the longest on record, is cooling as the effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus fade and global growth slows, with the International Monetary Fund again cutting its estimate earlier this week. A stronger dollar and new tariffs are also making it less desirable to do business with the U.S. 
 Other data have highlighted the cooler pace of growth, with manufacturing figures showing tepid conditions and bellwether Caterpillar Inc. reporting a lackluster second quarter. A U.S. measure of production has declined in consecutive quarters, the common definition of recession, while a gauge of global factory activity contracted in May and June. 
 Orders Gaining 
 A more upbeat report Thursday showed business-equipment orders jumped in June by the most since early 2018, signaling company investment may be regaining momentum that would help support the economy in coming months. 
 Consumer sentiment is near historical highs and robust spending is backstopping growth. Retail sales have advanced for four straight months, the longest streak since early 2018, indicating Americans are benefiting from a tight labor market and elevated wages. Coffee chain Starbucks Corp. on Thursday said U.S. comparable-store sales soared 7 per cent from a year earlier. 
 Trump targets growth of about 3 per cent, though economists see the pace of growth remaining under 2 per cent through at least the end of next year. Revised GDP figures released Friday show 2.5 per cent growth on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis last year. That compares with a previous estimate of 3 per cent and an upwardly revised 2.8 per cent in 2017, the first year of Trump’s presidency. 
 Government spending got a boost from a 15.9 per cent surge in federal nondefense expenditures, which contributed the most in two decades to growth. That was boosted by delayed compensation for some federal employees after the government shutdown that ended in January.",,,,

 Gross domestic product rose 6.2. per cent in the April-June period from a year earlier, below the 6.4 per cent expansion in the first quarter. In June, factory output and retail sales growth beat estimates, while investment in the first half of the year also gave further evidence that stimulus measures to curb the slowdown are feeding through. 
 
 Equity gauges in Shanghai and Hong Kong recouped early losses after the better-than-expected activity data. The offshore yuan was little changed. 
 The slowdown underlines the pressure that Chinese policy makers face as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the U.S. on trade, while the economy takes another step down in the long-term deceleration from the heady expansion of the mid-2000s. Although Chinese negotiators are talking with U.S. counterparts again, there is no certainty that a deal will be reached in time to prevent further economic damage. 
 “We continue to see the second-quarter growth slowing, but I think we are seeing the stabilization,” Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “The central bank needs to be a bit more proactive” going forward with additional reserve-requirement ratio reductions if higher tariffs come in, she said. 
 Net exports contributed to 20.7 per cent to output growth in the first half, down from 22.8 per cent in the first quarter. Trade data released Friday in Beijing detailed the weak end to the second quarter, as exports and imports fell. The surveyed urban jobless rate ticked up to 5.1 per cent from 5.0 per cent. 
 
 
 
 China’s 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal....

 What Bloomberg’s Economists Say 
 “Concerns over global growth slowdown and the persistence of U.S.-China trade war would continue to cloud the economic outlook. In the domestic market, whether the rebound in retail sales growth is sustainable is still uncertain.” 
 David Qu and Qian Wan, Bloomberg Economics 
 Stronger Investment 
 Fixed asset investment growth in the first half accelerated at private firms, whereas state companies eased back, a further sign that government efforts to funnel cash to the private sector may be bearing fruit. 
 For the manufacturing sector, investment accelerated a notch to three per cent in the first half, while infrastructure investment also picked up to 4.1 per cent. 
 
 Better-than-expected retail sales data also lend credence to the idea that stability will emerge in the second half of the year. While the data are volatile, faster growth in sales of consumer goods, household appliances and furniture also point to the modest recovery ongoing in the vital property sector. 
 The overall retail sales result was also driven by robust auto sales growth, though with heavy discounts attracting buyers in June economists remain cautious on whether that upturn can be sustained. 
 A fiscal stimulus plan including about two trillion yuan (US$291 billion) of tax cuts is slowly feeding through into the economy. The government has stepped up efforts recently, easing the rules for using government debt in some infrastructure projects and pledging to renovate hundreds of thousands of old buildings. 
 “We can take comfort in that the expansionary measures by the government are actually working,""said Mary-Therese Barton, head of emerging market debt at Pictet Asset Management SA, speaking on Bloomberg TV. ""So we take a lot of heart in the retail sales data, in particular, and the strength of domestic consumption.” 
 Property Outlook 
 Amid concerns about emerging price bubbles and risks in the financial sector, officials are likely to keep the recovery in the property market tightly controlled. Property development investment slowed for a second month in June, dragging down the growth of newly started property construction and inventory. 
 Until now, China’s leadership is tolerating the continued deceleration in the economy while the official unemployment rate remains low, and monetary policy has remained supportive without flooding the financial system with cash. Further tweaks to cement any nascent stabilization could be announced following a meeting of top leaders this month. 
 “China’s economy in the third quarter may face more downward pressure,” said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “There probably won’t be any obvious policy adjustment in July, but more possibilities of change in the fourth quarter.”

 Gross domestic product rose 0.3 per cent, after a 0.5 per cent gain in March, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. That marks the strongest two-month increase since the end of 2017. The figure topped the 0.2 per cent gain expected in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
 
 Key Insights 
 - It’s the first GDP print of the second quarter, and depicts an economy showing clear signs of a rebound after stalling at the end of last year and the beginning of 2019. 
 - Even without any more growth in May and June, the April number puts the economy on track for at least a 2 per cent gain on an annualized basis in the second quarter. That would be well above the Bank of Canada’s projection for 1.3 per cent annualized growth, keeping pressure off the central bank to match any easing trend in other advanced economies. 
 - It was largely an oil story in April, as the Alberta government eased curtailments on production. Excluding the mining, oil and gas sectors, Canadian GDP was flat on the month. 
 Get More 
 - The gains weren’t particularly broad-based. Eleven out of 20 sectors recorded higher output, driven by a 4.5 percent gain in mining, oil and gas. Oil-sands extraction jumped 11 per cent. 
 - One major pocket of weakness was manufacturing, which contracted 0.8 per cent in April -- the biggest one-month drop in almost two years. That was led by a sharp contraction in motor vehicle production, which Statistics Canada said reflected temporary shutdowns. 
 - The recovery in the construction sector continued in April, with output up 0.2 per cent. That’s the third gain in four months. 
 - Professional services and accommodation continued to grow, holding on to their status as the two fastest growing sectors over the past year.

Trump could also hit Iran’s central bank with secondary sanctions, at the risk of hurting humanitarian trade.“The Trump administration has already hit most of Iran’s cash-earning exports and pushed the country into a deep recession this year,” said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Center for New American Security, a Washington-based research group. “A lot of exports to Iran have dried up because of risk aversion and all the banking sanctions.”Trump announced plans for major sanctions on Saturday, following his abrupt cancellation of planned air strikes against the Islamic Republic for shooting down a U.S. Navy drone on Thursday.More than 80 per cent of Iran’s economy is under sanction today, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday before heading to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to rally a front against Iran. The new sanctions “will be a further effort to ensure that their capacity not only to grow their economy but to evade sanctions becomes more and more difficult,” Pompeo said.Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the new penalties won’t force the country to negotiate or capitulate.“Are there any other sanctions left for the U.S. to impose on Iran?” ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Monday, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The Trump administration “knows full well that if pressure and sanctions were the answer, they would have yielded results much earlier.”Iran’s navy chief warned earlier that other drones would be downed if U.S. intrusions into Iranian airspace continue. The U.S. says the aircraft was in international airspace.The U.S. has applied sanctions to nearly 1,000 Iranian entities, including banks, individuals, ships and aircraft. In May, the Trump administration prohibited the purchase of Iranian iron, steel, aluminum and copper.The U.S. has also revoked waivers that had allowed eight countries including India and China to import Iranian oil despite American sanctions. Trump seeks to drive Iranian oil exports to zero to force Tehran to abandon support for militant groups in the Middle East and renegotiate the 2015 nuclear accord the U.S. quit a year ago. Observed crude flows from Iran dropped to 190,000 barrels a day in the first half of June, less than 10 per cent of the volume shipped in early 2018.Forecasts from earlier this year show Iran’s GDP set to contract 6 per cent this year after declining 4 per cent in 2018.Exceptions to U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil sales will be made for humanitarian purchases such as for food and medicine, though it’s not clear how those would be determined or approved.The U.S. Treasury Department has also sanctioned Iran’s central bank governor and another senior official in the bank for allegedly providing support for terrorist activities.The moves so far haven’t been enough for at least one Republican lawmaker. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top GOP member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday egged on the Trump administration’s efforts.“We want them to be more desperate,” McCaul said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” news program. “We want them to have their economy crippled” so Iranian leaders will negotiate, he said.But with little left to sanction, added punishments would be mostly symbolic and “risk Iran escalating in retaliation,” Harrell said.Iranian authorities have already said new sanctions show that Trump’s call for negotiations — repeated over the weekend — was hollow. On Monday, President Hassan Rouhani’s adviser Hesameddin Ashena suggested the U.S. needs to offer incentives to Iran if it wants concessions.Bloomberg.com",,,,

While the research surrounding Canada’s reviews has been serious, the end result each time has only been minor changes.The biggest tweak, made in 2011, gave the Bank of Canada more time to reach its target. The underlying objective — to focus exclusively on price stability and use 2 per cent inflation as an operational guide — has been largely untouched.So why hasn’t the case for change been more compelling?Officials at the Bank of Canada, whose next mandate renewal takes place in 2021, boil it down to a few things:– The system is not perfect, but the framework has been largely successful even with the recent difficulties in hitting the target. Price pressures and inflation expectations are stable, and economic cycles over the past two decades have been less volatile than has been historically the case.– One of the biggest benefits of inflation targeting is it’s much easier to communicate, and for people to understand, than more complex approaches.– Perhaps more importantly is an acknowledgment that there is a false precision to the whole business of inflation targeting. Economics isn’t an exact-enough science to really allow them to get it perfectly, which is why Canadian policy makers are happy to allow inflation to move within a range — 1 per cent to 3 per cent — and would become worried only if they see a real risk of the band being breached. The 2 per cent “target” is simply the midpoint.“For now what we’ve got is the inflation target and it’s done a good job for us,” is how Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz recently put it.On the idea of average inflation targeting being touted widely, for example, Poloz says it makes a lot of sense theoretically “but in practice, I’d need to be persuaded myself.”“The ability to let it cruise above 2 and know exactly when to prevent it from continuing on towards 3 is a lot harder than rocket science,” said Poloz. It’s “really hard to pull off and risky on the upside.”That doesn’t mean things won’t change. Poloz and his main deputy overseeing the review, Carolyn Wilkins, seem to be open to new ideas, particularly given how monetary policy is becoming increasingly constrained by low interest rates and inflation. That’s a world where the central bank has limited firepower to fight a recession, even as cheap money threatens to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis.As a result, the latest review underway at the Bank of Canada seems to be the most ambitious yet. Alternatives under consideration include raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate, targeting nominal GDP and even average inflation targeting.Yet, Canadian monetary policymakers are also quick to point out that there are limits to what central banks can do to solve all the economy’s ills. Government policy too, they point out, has an important role, particularly in tackling structural issues.Bloomberg.com",,,,

The 10-year yield fell five basis points to 1.51 per cent, the lowest in two years. An inverted yield curve, in which short-term rates are higher than longer-term yields, is considered by some economists a signal that a recession is looming.Investors are buying long-term bonds after President Trump announced Thursday evening a plan to impose a 5 per cent tariff on imports from Mexico to force the Latin American nation to bolster efforts to stop illegal immigration. The move came just hours after Vice President Mike Pence promised to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement this year, in a meeting in Ottawa with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The “new threats of U.S. tariffs on Mexico – even as passage of the new USMCA seemed to be getting closer — is a reminder that no trade agreement or past indications of goodwill is really full protection against a re-emergence of tensions with the U.S. under the Trump administration, ” said Nathan Janzen, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note. “That uncertainty will remain a headwind for business investment spending in particular.”The increased trade tensions threaten a Canadian economy that is showing signs of emerging from its first-quarter slump. The economy grew by 0.5 per cent in March, topping estimates, after an expansion of just 0.4 per cent for the first three months of the year, Statistics Canada reported Friday.“The current economic backdrop still looks okay, and better than quarterly GDP growth headlines in the last couple of quarters would imply,” said Janzen. “There is still plenty of uncertainty about the outlook to keep the BoC on the sidelines in terms of any future interest rate hikes for now.”Bloomberg.com",,,,

Cash flow insolvency, on the other hand, is when a person can’t pay off debts because of difficulties selling their assets. Of the two, balance sheet insolvency is more serious.“It’s hard to sell your house at a moment’s notice, but that’s really a matter of being illiquid, and not what economists would typically think of as insolvency,” said Jeremy Kronick, associate director of research at C.D. Howe and one of the report’s authors. “There’s a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and not.”There's a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and notAlong with near-record debt-service ratios and rising borrowing costs, rising insolvencies are adding to concern about the sustainability of the country’s lofty household debt levels. To determine how significant the increase in insolvencies is, Kronick argues data at the individual level is needed.The Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies separates insolvencies into bankruptcies and so-called proposals, when a debtor agrees with creditors to pay off a certain portion of the debt over time. The OSB’s monthly and quarterly reports give the volume of insolvencies, without disclosing liabilities and assets. It discloses those in its annual reports, but aggregated by city and region.“Bankruptcies and consumer proposals include both cash-flow and balance sheet insolvencies,” a spokesman for the OSB said by email. “No distinction is made under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act between those two types of insolvencies.”In addition to calling for more detailed insolvency data, the researchers argue some of the warnings about Canada’s rising debt loads may be overstated, given the country’s debt-to-net worth ratio has stayed relatively constant at 20% since 2007, even though debt-to-GDP has risen to 100%, from 75%.“We’re not saying all’s well,” Kronick said. “We’re just trying to say there’s a big difference that we should recognize, but we can’t because we don’t have enough here to tell us.”Bloomberg.com",,,,

The record also showed officials becoming more optimistic about the U.S. 2019 economic outlook before President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. They also had a debate about the future composition of the bond portfolio.Many participants viewed the recent easing in inflation “as likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective,” the minutes said.The Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures, excluding food and energy, slowed to a 1.6 per cent increase in the 12 months through March despite solid economic growth and a tight labour market.The FOMC at the meeting left its benchmark policy rate unchanged in a 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent target range and reiterated its pledge to be “patient” in weighing future moves. The committee next gathers on June 18-19.Fed officials received a staff presentation on two approaches to adjusting the maturity composition of the central bank’s portfolio. One approach would return the portfolio to a composition similar to outstanding Treasury securities, while another would result in a shorter-term maturity structure of three years or less.The staff analysis showed that a move to the shorter-term portfolio “would put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook,” the minutes said.In their discussion of a portfolio proportional to the Treasury market, “participants observed that moving to this target” of portfolio composition “would not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks.”Several participants judged that the proportional approach would be “well aligned with the committee’s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy.” At the same time, some of the debate focused on how much capacity each strategy would allow for adding economic stimulus through a maturity extension program.Investors have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates later this year partly on concern over inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, which prices have done for most of the last seven years.On the economic outlook, “many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated,” according to the minutes.GDP expanded at a 3.2 per cent annual pace in the first quarter,surpassing expectations, and unemployment hit a 49-year low in April.

107,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Reade Pickert and Jeff Kearns,Trump hails America’s blockbuster GDP growth — 'far higher than the high expectations',But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number,1,headline more important,0,Balanced out,4/26/2019,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-growth-of-3-2-tops-forecasts-on-trade-inventory-boost,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/trump.jpg,"U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter on a big boost from inventories and trade that offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending, with President Donald Trump touting the report as much stronger than expected.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized rate in the January-March period, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey calling for 2.3 per cent growth. That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months.The numbers may bolster hopes that growth is stabilizing after its recent soft patch. Trump, speaking with reporters before departing on a trip on Air Force One, said the GDP numbers were “far higher than the high expectations.”But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers’ 2 per cent objective.Even so, the data showing faster growth and tame inflation helped push Treasury yields lower Friday. U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components — inventories and trade — that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed’s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation’s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump’s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a “great number,” consumer spending “has to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. “We think it will, but it’s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.”“While this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker — namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.” — Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can’t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday’s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final sales to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties.With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Shelly Hagan, Alyza Sebenius, Alister Bull and Justin SinkBloomberg.com",,,,

He cited recent data — the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January — to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.“There are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,” he said. “Recent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.”Poloz’s comments are the first since a segment of Canada’s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada’s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need — at least over time — for rates to move higher. He didn’t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada’s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term — unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada’s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.In his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy’s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to “positive growth” later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will “eventually be completed.” Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials “they need to make new investments,” aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.“We only have to look back a few years for an example,” said Poloz, “following the oil price collapse of 2015.”He also cited “numerous advantages” beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth — including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a “portfolio” of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials — after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector — can “see many areas of encouraging economic growth” in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.“These data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,” Poloz said. “Judging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.”Bloomberg.com",,,,

A segment of Canada’s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time since 2007. Investors now see a strong chance of a cut by the Bank of Canada over the next 12 months.This raises a major challenge for Poloz, one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need — at least over time — for rates to move higher. Whether he shrugs off the latest market moves remains the big question ahead of the central bank’s next decision on April 24.“We don’t think it’s appropriate to be talking about cutting rates at this juncture,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. Poloz “could take one more turn of the dovish screw, I suppose, by going completely neutral — although I believe it would be more appropriate to do that at the next decision date. ”The gap between Canadian three-month and 10-year rates went negative on March 21, tracking a similar move in the U.S. For investors predicting a recession south of the border, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to assume Canada would be pulled into one as well. All of the country’s last eight recessions have coincided with contractions in the U.S.The Bank of Canada hasn’t said much during the recent turbulence. Its last public communication was a March 14 speech by Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins in which she highlighted the vulnerabilities created by global leverage but said the central bank expects the worldwide expansion to continue and Canada’s economic growth to pick up after a weaker-than-expected first half.Her comments reiterated language from the central bank’s decision on March 6, when it left rates unchanged and toned down its conviction that interest rates need to go higher, while sticking to an overall hiking stance.Poloz’s speech, titled the “Importance of Trade,” will be published at 2:55 p.m. Ottawa time. Iqaluit is situated 195 miles south of the Arctic Circle.Even as markets continue to bet on cuts, the data is mixed enough to keep Poloz on the sidelines for the foreseeable future. The latest gross domestic product data show the economy expanded at a 0.3 per cent pace in January, painting a less bleak picture than feared. Growth is tracking an annualized first-quarter pace of more than 1 per cent, a big improvement from the previous quarter’s 0.4 per cent.“The Canadian expansion faces a host of challenges in 2019. Escalating global risks and weaker-than-expected GDP at year-end signal below-trend growth this year. This means inflationary pressures should be subdued, which will allow the Bank of Canada to pause on its path back to neutral to assess the changing landscape.”The Bank of Canada will release a new set of quarterly economic forecasts at its April meeting that will likely be revised down. In January, it forecast growth of 2 per cent in 2018 and 1.7 percent this year. The 2018 number came in at 1.8 per cent. Economists have since lowered estimates for 2019 closer to 1.5 per cent.Policy makers will also use the April meeting to review their neutral interest rate forecast — a key variable for plotting decisions. The measure is used to gauge how stimulative the policy rate is: the bigger the gap between the actual rate and the neutral rate, the more stimulative the policy, while a smaller gap would indicate fewer hikes are required. A downward revision would imply current policy is tighter than previously assumed.Until now, the central bank has estimated the neutral rate is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Bloomberg.com",,,,

 Gross domestic product grew at a 2.2 per cent annualized rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday, less than the initial 2.6 per cent reading and projections for a revision of 2.3 per cent. Consumer spending, biggest part of the economy, grew at a downwardly revised 2.5 per cent pace that also missed projections. 
 The final reading on a turbulent quarter that included U.S. stocks tumbling to the cusp of a bear market adds to concerns for the world’s biggest economy as global headwinds gather from Europe to China. While Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this month that underlying economic fundamentals remain strong, policy makers have cut their outlook for growth this year and next and forecast no interest-rate hikes for 2019. 
 While the expansion is poised to become the nation’s longest on record at midyear, the downward revision indicates that the economy had weaker momentum heading into 2019, when various indicators in housing and manufacturing have been showing signs of cooling. 
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project that growth in GDP, which measures the value of all goods and services produced in the country, will slow to 1.5 per cent in the first quarter, the slowest pace in two years. 
 The less-robust reading -- which followed 3.4 per cent growth in the third quarter -- reflected broad revisions to spending on consumer goods, including recreational goods and vehicles. State and local government spending was downwardly revised on investment in structures, while business fixed investment was reduced on software spending. 
 3% Milestone 
 The report kept intact an economic milestone that President Donald Trump has boasted about, as the Republican-backed tax cuts helped bring full-year growth to 3 per cent, as measured on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis. That was the fastest since 2005 and compares with the initial reading of 3.1 per cent. The White House has set a 3 per cent goal for expansion. 
 Meanwhile, there is some risk that Trump’s tariffs could weigh on future growth. Net exports remained a drag on the expansion. 
 Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a downwardly revised 2.1 per cent pace after 2.9 per cent in the third quarter. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. 
 The report also gave the first read on business earnings in the fourth quarter. Pretax corporate profits fell 0.4 per cent from the prior quarter for the first decline since early 2017, though profits still rose 7.4 per cent from a year earlier. 
 While the expansion has moderated, the labor market has remained in generally solid shape despite some recent gyrations. Payrolls grew by an average of 186,000 over the past three months as the unemployment held around the lowest levels in a half century. 
 A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits fell to a two-month low. Jobless claims decreased to 211,000 in the week ended March 23, below what economists had forecast.

 Its new GDP tracker puts world growth at 2.1 percent on a quarter-on-quarter annualized basis, down from about 4 percent in the middle of last year. While there’s a chance that the economy may find a foothold and arrest the slowdown, “the risk is that downward momentum will be self-sustaining,” say economists Dan Hanson and Tom Orlik. 
 The reasons for hope? The Federal Reserve’s decision to pause its interest-rate hikes, a U.S.-China trade truce and the fading of the shocks that battered Europe in 2018 could mean stabilization is around the corner. Other central banks have also stepped up, with the European Central Bank last week announcing new measures to help the economy through the current weakness. 
 But the global economy is not out of the woods. The OECD’s latest composite leading indicator -- published Monday -- indicates easing momentum in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and the euro area as a whole, including Germany and Italy. There are, however, signs of stabilization in China. 
 Despite the gloom, ECB policy makers have been keen to put a brave face on the deterioration, pushing the view the euro zone is experiencing a slowdown, not a recession. 
 “We are still seeing robust economic growth, although it’s less strong than before,” Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said in an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published Monday. “It will take longer for inflation to reach our objective, but it will get there. We are reacting to the developments we have seen so far.” 
 What Bloomberg Economists Say 
 “The cyclical upswing that took hold of the global economy in mid-2017 was never going to last. Even so, the extent of the slowdown since late last year has surprised many economists, including us.” 
 There has been a modest pickup in some economic numbers recently, though also high-profile disappointments. U.S. retail sales rose in January after the biggest fall in almost a decade in December. A measure that some view as a cleaner gauge of consumer demand jumped 1.1 per cent. 
 Last week, the U.S. reported employers added the fewest jobs in more than two years. There may have been one-off factors to blame, but the scale of the miss puts in focus the idea that the economy’s losing steam. 
 In Germany, industrial output unexpectedly fell in January, though a large upward revision to December nullified some of the gloom. A manufacturing index points to an extended slump, and production has posted year-on-year declines three months in a row.",,,,

 The data could also raise pressure on Justin Trudeau’s finance minister to ease restrictions on homebuyers, Holt said. Nonetheless, he urged investors not to panic. 
 “I still believe that Q4 softness was transitory and a rebound will be in the cards,” he wrote.

 The 2.6 per cent annualized rate of gains in gross domestic product from October to December compared with the 2.2 per cent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. It followed a 3.4 per cent advance in the prior three months, according to a Commerce Department report Thursday that was delayed a month by the government shutdown. 
 Consumption, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 2.8 per cent, slightly below forecasts, while nonresidential business investment accelerated to a 6.2 per cent gain on equipment, software and research spending. Government spending slowed, trade was a minor drag and inventories gave GDP a small boost. 
 The report shows how Republican-backed tax cuts may have continued to aid growth and help bring the full-year figure to 3.1 per cent, just above President Donald Trump’s 3 per cent goal. While the expansion is poised to become the nation's longest on record at midyear amid a still-healthy consumer, supportive Fed and robust labor market, the pace could cool amid the trade war, slowing global growth and fading impact of fiscal stimulus. 
 A separate report Thursday from the Labor Department showed filings for unemployment benefits rose by more than expected last week to 225,000, still near a five-decade low. The week included the Presidents Day holiday, and claims tend to be more volatile around such events. 
 Potential Growth 
 Growth, while slower than the prior two quarters, remains above both the average pace of the expansion and what the Fed sees as the economy's long-run potential of 1.9 per cent. Still, surveys and gauges such as Treasury yields indicate chances of a recession have increased in recent months while remaining unlikely for 2019. 
 Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 2.6 per cent pace following 2.9 per cent. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. 
 The increase in consumer spending followed the third quarter's 3.5 percent gain. It contributed 1.92 percentage points to growth. Drivers included health care, financial services and insurance, and other nondurable goods and services, while spending on food services and accommodations fell. 
 The GDP data may reinforce analyst criticism of the government's recent report on December retail sales. That showed the biggest drop in nine years, even as other figures -- particularly reports from the country’s largest retailers -- indicated consumers continued to open their wallets in the quarter. 
 Thursday's report showed the third-quarter slowdown in business spending may have been temporary. Nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0.82 percentage point to growth following 0.35 point in the third quarter. 
 Within that category, spending on structures fell 4.2 percent, the biggest drop in a year, a slowdown that may partly reflect falling oil prices. Business-equipment investment rose 6.7 percent and intellectual property spending jumped 13.1 percent. 
 Residential Drag 
 Housing remained a weak spot last quarter, posting the fourth consecutive drag on GDP growth, with a contraction of 3.5 percent. Home sales tumbled in late 2018 amid elevated mortgage rates and price increases that continued to outpace wages, though there are signs of demand picking up in early 2019 thanks to a drop in borrowing costs. 
 Net exports subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth during the quarter following a 1.99-point reduction in the prior period. The drag reflected a 2.7 percent rise in imports that outpaced a 1.6 per cent increase in exports, with the tariff war buffeting both sets of flows. 
 Inventories added 0.13 percentage point to the pace of expansion. 
 Meanwhile, inflation remained muted, adding little urgency for the Fed to consider resuming interest-rate hikes. The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred price index rose at a 1.5 percent annualized pace last quarter, below the central bank's 2 per cent goal. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 1.7 percent.

 The partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22, had the effect of lowering fourth-quarter GDP growth by about 0.1 percentage point when accounting for the impact of reductions in services provided by the federal government, though the Commerce Department cautioned that the full effects of the shutdown on the economy can't be quantified.

 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 per cent annualized pace in the fourth quarter following the best back-to-back gains since 2014, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of the Commerce Department report. Consumption remained the main driver, easing to a 3 per cent increase, and government spending likely aided growth; the other principal categories of business investment, housing, trade and inventories all figure to provide either minor boosts or drags. 
 While full-year 2018 growth probably came in near President Donald Trump’s 3 per cent target, most analysts expect that pace to be short-lived, even as the expansion is on track to become the country’s longest on record in July. The bigger question is whether growth will stabilize around its prior trend or is poised to weaken further -- potentially into a recession. 
 “Consumer spending looks to have been slowing in the fourth quarter, business investment has been slowing since early last year-- those patterns continued in the fourth quarter and we think trade has a lot to do with it,” said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS Group AG. “The slowing in the fourth quarter is believable -- and the question is how long it lasts.” 
 A report Wednesday showed the U.S. merchandise-trade deficit widened by more than forecast in December to a record, suggesting GDP could come in lower than some analysts were expecting. 
 Consumer spending, which accounts for most of the economy, is supported by a strong labor market and rising wages, and corporate investment has been buoyed by tax cuts. But that dynamic appeared to sour toward year-end. 
 While the outlook remains favorable, the economy is feeling crosswinds from slowing global growth and uncertainty over trade, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in Senate testimony Tuesday. 
 There were signs of weakness near the end of 2018. December retail sales unexpectedly dropped by the most in nine years despite elevated consumer sentiment. Economists were quick to cast doubt on that month’s report, highlighting strong signals from other data providers and quarterly earnings figures from retailers. Yet any sign of consumer deterioration in the GDP data doesn’t bode well for what comes next. 
 “It looks like investment’s kind of flat-lined, so we are even more dependent on the consumer,” said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale SA. “That’s going to be the key. What retail sales do is not just give you a really bad end to the fourth quarter, but it suggests that the first quarter might start off on pretty soft footing as well.” 
 Government outlays -- which picked up in the prior two quarters after Congress approved higher spending, particularly on defense -- likely helped growth again. But Sharif compares the boost last year from spending and tax cuts to a “sugar high” that will fade this year. 
 “Now we’re settling back into the sort of expansion we’ve had for most of the business cycle,” Sharif said. 
 On the non-government side, it’s a more downbeat picture: a proxy for business-equipment orders fell in December for the fourth time in five months, a sign that uncertainty over the U.S. trade war with China is weighing on investment. 
 In addition, factory output contracted in January after a downwardly revised December gain. And housing investment may have shrunk for the fourth consecutive quarter as sales and construction cool, though lower mortgage rates may be boosting demand in early 2019. 
 “There’s no question that the prospects for the first quarter are much more important right now to the thinking in the markets and at the Federal Reserve as well, versus how the fourth quarter turned out,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. “Expectations have got to be pretty muted for the first quarter at this point.”",,,,

The ambiguity caused the almost-decade-long rally in U.S. stocks to come within a whisker of its end in December.“It seems like there has to be an elevated probability of a recession this year or next year,” the Yale University economics professor said during a panel discussion at the InsideETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. “There are these signs that show people are worried. It’s also the longest bull market in the stock market,” he said. “There’s a spirit of thinking –- it ought to come to an end soon.”The chance of a recession happening over the next 12 months is 25 per cent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in Mississippi that “we don’t feel the probability of recession is at all elevated.”The ongoing debate makes it all the more important to focus on how the markets are interrelated, said Jeffrey Sherman, DoubleLine Capital LP’s deputy chief investment officer. Rates are higher compared with recent history, we’ve seen margins compress a bit, and it’s possible GDP growth slows down to trend — closer to two per cent, he said. When it comes to investing, everyone needs some stocks in their portfolios, they just have to be “more cautious,” Sherman said during the panel discussion.“You have peak earnings and peak euphoria,” Sherman said. “The question becomes, how does corporate America respond at this stage? It doesn’t look horrible.”Shiller and DoubleLine have a long relationship. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund puts the majority of its investments into a fixed-income portfolio, while at the same time employing derivatives to gain exposure to large-cap equities that are undervalued based on an index created by Shiller. Launched in 2013, the fund’s five-year track record puts the product in the 99th percentile when compared with peers, according to a Bloomberg ranking.The cyclically adjusted P-E ratio (CAPE), which Shiller developed 30 years ago, uses 10 years of earnings in its calculations to gauge stock market valuations. Right now the measure comes in around 30, which is “quite high” according to Shiller, especially considering that’s about double the historical average. Going forward, though, the ratio should come down just because of time — the worst earnings during the financial crisis should fall out of the equation soon.“That doesn’t mean you expect negative returns,” Shiller said.Bloomberg.com",,,,

 Gross domestic product declined 0.1 per cent in November, Statistics Canada said Thursday from Ottawa, matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
 Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz signaled earlier this month he will take longer to add to his five interest-rate increases since the middle of 2017 because of signs of setbacks to growth. The weakness, even if temporary, illustrates risks to an economy that needs business spending to take over from consumers who are burdened by record debts. 
 The numbers leave the Bank of Canada “decidedly on hold for the next couple of quarters,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to investors. 
 The central bank predicts the annualized pace of growth will slow to 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and again to 0.8 per cent in the first three months of this year. The economy is expected to rebound after that on strong job creation and business spending, with policy makers saying interest rates will still likely move higher over time. 
 Output from the energy industry fell 0.6 per cent, Statistics Canada said. Lower production of petroleum and coal also drove a 0.5 per cent decline in manufacturing in November, the third drop in four months. Wholesaling fell by 1.1 per cent led by machinery and equipment, and construction fell for the sixth straight month to the lowest since the middle of 2017. 
 Tumbling prices for Alberta oil late last year led the provincial government to impose production cuts that began in January. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are facing pressure before elections this year to develop stalled pipelines and send crude overseas rather than accept lower prices in the U.S. market. 
 Retail spending remained weak in November, with a 0.3 per cent decline led by a 2 per cent drop in car sales. Retailing has declined by 1.2 per cent over the last year, the only major industry besides construction to shrink over that period. 
 There was some evidence the weakness may not last. Transportation and warehousing was dragged down by a postal strike that ended around the end of the month, and Statistics Canada also said there were maintenance shutdowns at some auto assembly plants and offshore oil sites on the east coast after a storm.

The delay will likely last until after the U.S. Census Bureau resumes normal operations. Since 1990, the Canadian agency has been using U.S. figures to calculate the nation’s exports to its biggest trading partner.“Trade statistics without Canada’s exports to the U.S. have limited use as a current economic indicator, as these exports represent approximately 75 per cent of Canada’s total exports,” the Ottawa-based agency said on its website.The lack of merchandise trade data casts a fog over the state of the nation’s economy, and raises the prospect of a prolonged delay handcuffing the Bank of Canada’s ability to properly assess the economic outlook as it considers additional interest rate increases.“With more U.S. indicators being delayed — especially at the start of the year — it will become more difficult for the Bank of Canada to forecast where the economy and exports are headed in 2019,” Dominique Lapointe, an economist with Laurentian Bank Securities Inc., said from Montreal.Policy makers, however, had been widely expected to remain on hold for at least the next few months. That means the data gap caused by the shutdown isn’t likely to have an immediate impact on Bank of Canada rate expectations, according to Bipan Rai, head of North American foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto.“The bank seems to be have gotten its message across” on a pause, Rai said by phone.”We don’t expect them to deviate too much from that message, at least in the coming months.”The shutdown in Washington isn’t just impacting the trade report. Export numbers are also used as inputs for quarterly gross domestic estimates, but Canada’s statistics agency said it will still be able to publish GDP numbers for the fourth quarter as scheduled because it has enough data from October and November to make calculations.The agency said other options for the trade data may be considered if the U.S. shutdown drags on.With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com",,,,

The full text of the letter as it appears on Apple’s website is below:To Apple investors:Today we are revising our guidance for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:Revenue of approximately US$84 billion Gross margin of approximately 38 per cent Operating expenses of approximately US$8.7 billion Other income/(expense) of approximately US$550 million Tax rate of approximately 16.5 per cent before discrete items.We expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates.When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:First, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4’18–placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1’18, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1’19, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.Second, we knew the strong U.S. dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.Third, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.Fourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected.In addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated.These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I’d like to go a bit deeper on both.While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.Despite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.While it’s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges.Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high–growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it’s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers.Also, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.Services generated over US$10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.Wearables grew by almost 50 per cent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.Finally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple’s earnings per share.Our profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately US$130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.As we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result.Most importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.We can’t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base.This is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple’s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.Expectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.That has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.TimBloomberg.com",-1,signals China econ worse-than-expectation,,

The discount on Western Canadian Select to U.S. benchmark prices widened to US$50 a barrel in October, which Notley says is costing Canada billions of dollars in lost revenue. Oil cutbacks add to strains such as slowing consumer spending and the scheduled shutdown of a General Motors Co. plant east of Toronto ahead of the central bank’s next rate decision Wednesday.“With oil prices lower and production cuts on the horizon, it’s less of a reason for the Bank of Canada to come out very hawkish later this week,” Mendes said by phone Monday. “It’s not only the production, because when these oil prices are low it also means these companies in the oilpatch are less likely to invest.”Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, continues to predict no move from the central bank this week and a rate increase in January, because policy makers may see some of the energy weakness as temporary.

39,Bloomberg News,Theophilos Argitis,"Canada's growth weakens as investment drops, consumers fade","Heightened trade uncertainty over the summer took a major toll on Canada's economy in the third quarter, prompting households to slow consumption and businesses to sharply curtail investment.",-1,,-1,,11/30/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-growth-weakens-as-investment-drops-consumers-fade-1.1176323,,"Heightened trade uncertainty over the summer took a major toll on Canada's economy in the third quarter, prompting households to slow consumption and businesses to sharply curtail investment. 
 Statistics Canada released data Friday showing consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in more than two years, while businesses recorded an unexpected drop in investment and scaled back on inventories. Overall, the economy grew at a 2 per cent annualized pace, largely due an improved trade picture as imports fell. Domestic demand -- which excludes trade -- was the weakest in more than a year, recording a slight contraction. 
 While the headline growth figure came in as economists had expected, the numbers suggest the growing trade tensions that occurred over the summer -- and eventually culminated in a new deal with the U.S. and Mexico -- put at least a temporary chill on spending. 
 Other factors impacting growth may have been a weakening outlook for the country's oil industry and the impact of rising interest rates on consumers. 
 Consumption slowed to an annualized 1.2 per cent pace in the third quarter, the weakest growth since the first quarter of 2016. That's even as households scaled back on savings. 
 Sluggish business investment may be the biggest surprise in the data, with non-residential capital spending down an annualized 7.1 per cent -- the first decline since the fourth quarter of 2016. Residential investment contracted for a third straight quarter, down an annualized 5.9 per cent. 
 For the three months between July and September, it all added up to sluggish domestic demand, down an annualized 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. 
 September ended up being the worst month of the quarter, with data released Friday showing a 0.1 per cent drop. That was the first monthly decline since January. Economists predicted an increase of 0.1 per cent. 
 The report could raise concerns about the health of the economy, which has been doing relatively well up until now even in the face of higher interest rates. The economy grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3.1 per cent in 2017, and had expanded at a healthy 2.3 per cent clip in the first half of this year in part due to stronger business investment. It grew 2.9 per cent in the second quarter. 
 Imports fell an annualized 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, on a sharp drop in refined petroleum products. The decline in imports coincided with increased domestic production of gasoline after the completion of maintenance work at Canadian refineries. 
 Because exports eked out a small 0.9 annualized increase in the third quarter, the contribution of trade on growth was large -- adding about 3 percentage points. 
 Another major drag on growth was a slowdown in inventory accumulation. That impact dragged down annualized growth by 1.3 percentage points.",,,,

 General Motors Co.’s announcement Monday that it plans to pull production from its plant in Oshawa, east of Toronto, raises concern about the auto industry’s viability in Canada. It came on the heels of an emerging crisis in the oil sector, which is struggling with plunging prices and transportation bottlenecks. 
 Combined, the energy and automotive industries generate almost one quarter of Canadian export receipts. So their troubles are a reminder there are no guarantees the economy will be able to pull off a smooth transition to a business-led expansion as consumers begin to tap out. Third-quarter gross domestic product data is due out Friday. 
 “The news that we’ve been seeing both in terms of the energy and the auto sectors gives a little bit more caution to the degree of that pickup in exports and investment on a go-forward basis,” Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview. 
 
 Until now, things have been going well for Canada’s economy. It grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3.1 per cent in 2017, and is continuing to expand at a healthy clip of 2 per cent this year even in the face of higher interest rates. A recent recovery in business investment, an improving trade picture and still growing consumer spending are helping to fuel the growth. 
 Statistics Canada’s latest GDP estimates are expected to show the economy grew by about 2 per cent in the third quarter, in line with the 2.2 per cent pace posted in the first half of 2018. 
 But to keep growth at or near these levels going forward will require businesses to continue stepping up in terms of investment and exports. Most economists believe Canada’s highly-indebted households are about to slip into a long-term slump as borrowing costs rise, with consumer spending projected to slow down to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession. 
 Yet the recent developments in the auto and oil sectors raise the prospect that transition may need to take place without two critical industries -- a major handicap. 
 While the shutdown of GM’s Oshawa plant will only affect about 3,000 hourly and salaried workers -- economists at Bank of Montreal estimate GDP could be hit by as much as 0.2 per cent over a full year -- the concern is it could snowball to other companies and spill over into the auto parts sector. 
 ‘More to Come’ 
 “If there is a ‘canary’ out there it has been slowly dying for quite some time,” Dennis DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc., said by email. “I am not saying that Canada will become Australia and eventually lose all its vehicle assembly operations, but there is more to come.” 
 The oil industry’s problems could be even more significant. Economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank estimate a hit of 0.5 percentage points to growth if the current pricing environment persists, though they do expect a rebound. 
 Gluskin Sheff’s chief economist and strategist David Rosenberg estimates a larger-than-consensus growth hit of 0.4 per cent from the General Motors shutdown, with a similar 0.5 per cent hit from oil. That would take Canadian growth down closer to 1 per cent, far from the current pace, he said in a Nov. 27 research note that included ten reasons “to hate” the Canadian dollar. 
 “As for Canada, the tale of woes continues,” he said.

 Gross domestic product grew at an unrevised 3.5 per cent annualized rate, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Household spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy, grew 3.6 per cent, revised from 4 per cent, on weaker durable goods purchases. 
 Key Insights 
 
 The biggest change from the prior report on GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the nation, came from stronger business investment, while most other categories were in line with earlier readings. 
 Nonresidential fixed investment -- which includes spending on equipment, structures and intellectual property - grew 2.5 per cent, revised from a 0.8 per cent gain. Economists are monitoring such spending because, along with consumer purchases, it was a main driver of growth in the first half. 
 Combined with a 4.2 per cent pace of GDP growth in the April to June period, the results capped the best back-to-back quarters since 2014. At the same time, growth is projected to moderate this quarter. 
 Risks to the outlook include an escalating trade war with China, cooling global demand and rising borrowing costs, while the boost from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts is expected to wane next year. 
 The report also provided a first glimpse of some key data: Corporate pretax earnings rose 10.3 per cent from a year earlier, the most in six years, after a 7.3 per cent advance. Gross domestic income rose 4 per cent, the most since 2014.

 Equipment spending was revised up to a 3.5 per cent rise from a 0.4 per cent gain, while investment in structures showed a 1.7 per cent drop compared with a previously reported decline of 7.9 per cent. 
 Net exports subtracted 1.91 percentage point from growth, while inventories added provided a 2.27 point boost. 
 Stripping out the volatile components of trade and inventories, so-called final sales to domestic purchasers climbed at an unrevised 3.1 per cent pace. 
 Housing still posted a third consecutive drag on GDP growth and reaffirmed that the industry has entered a broad slowdown. Residential investment fell 2.6 per cent, compared with an initially reported contraction of 4 per cent. 
 Inflation rose an unrevised 1.7 per cent. The Federal Reserve’s goal is 2 per cent based on its preferred gauge tracking personal consumption expenditures. Excluding food and energy, the Fed’s preferred price index advanced 1.5 per cent, revised from 1.6 per cent. 
 Government spending increased at a 2.6 per cent rate, revised from 3.3 per cent. That added 0.44 point to growth.

42,Bloomberg News,Greg Quinn,Canadian economy expands for seventh month on oil extraction,"Canada’s economy grew for a seventh consecutive month in August, led by crude oil and financial services, keeping the momentum going for higher interest rates.",1,,1,,10/31/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-economy-expands-for-seventh-month-on-oil-extraction-1.1160990,,"Canada’s economy grew for a seventh consecutive month in August, led by crude oil and financial services, keeping the momentum going for higher interest rates. 
 Gross domestic product climbed 0.1 percent on the month, Statistics Canada said Wednesday from Ottawa. That beat the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for an unchanged reading. 
 Alberta’s oil production rose to a record and higher stock and bond trading boosted the contribution of financial services companies by the most since May 2017. Utilities and the public sector also added to the growth. 
 The economy is at or near full capacity, according to the Bank of Canada, which this month raised interest rates for a fifth time since July 2017 and signaled more hikes are needed to bring monetary policy to neutral. Other major indicators back up the idea the economy no longer needs stimulus, with inflation around 2 percent and unemployment close to record lows. 
 The gain keeps the economy on track for annualized growth of around 2 percent, meaning the central bank could raise interest rates again in January, said Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “Combine a healthy economic outlook with the tilt towards hawkishness that accompanied last week’s rate hike, and you have the recipe for further monetary tightening,” he wrote in a research note. 
 While the August GDP gain was a surprise, it lacked the breadth seen in some past reports, with 12 of 20 major industries posting declines. The Canadian dollar initially erased declines on the report before falling back. It was 0.2 per cent weaker at $1.3135 against the U.S. dollar at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto. 
 Report Highlights 
 
 Non-conventional crude oil extraction was a major driver of growth in August, rising 3.2 per cent. 
 The other major gain was one per cent in financial services Statistics Canada revised the June GDP figure to a 0.1 per cent increase from a prior flat reading, which turned what was two straight months of expansion into seven. 
 There was a similar run of growth last year when Canada led the G-7 The output of utilities companies rose 0.8 per cent, reflecting a second month of hot summer weather in Canada. 
 The other growth driver in August was the public sector’s 0.2 per cent rise The 2018 real estate slowdown continued with a 0.4 per cent fall in construction. 
 Residential projects declined 1.6 per cet and the decline over the past three months is the largest since the start of 2009, Statistics Canada said Manufacturing was the biggest drag with a 0.6 per cent fall, led by shutdowns at auto assembly plants. Retail and wholesale sales also weakened in August and production from copper and nickel mines fell to the lowest since 2010

44,Bloomberg News,,China economic growth slows more than expected in third quarter,"China’s economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, as weak industrial output data and what the government called the ""severe international situation"" challenged efforts to stabilize the economy and reach its growth targets.",-1,Canada's large trading partner,-1,,10/18/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-economic-growth-slows-more-than-expected-in-third-quarter-1.1154906,,"China’s economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, as weak industrial output data and what the government called the ""severe international situation"" challenged efforts to stabilize the economy and reach its growth targets. 
 Gross domestic product increased 6.5 per cent in the three months through September from a year earlier, compared to 6.6 per cent in a Bloomberg survey and down from the 6.7 per cent pace in the previous quarter. That’s the slowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. 
 The economy has faced increasing headwinds this year, with worsening trade tensions and a slumping stock market hurting confidence in the outlook. Those problems have prompted officials to step up stimulus and pledges of further support, but the impact of those measures has yet to kick in and more may be needed. 
 National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Mao Shengyong said at a briefing Friday that while the international situation was bringing “downward pressure” on China’s economy, growth is still stable and the nation is on track to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 per cent. 
Details of the release Industrial output rose 5.8 per cent last month from a year earlier, versus the forecast of 6 per cent, the statistics office said Retail sales increased 9.2 per cent in September, compared with the forecast 9 per cent Fixed-asset investment climbed 5.4 per cent in the first nine months, versus a forecast of 5.3 per cent The urban monthly surveyed unemployment rate stood at 4.9 per cent at end-September

 ""China’s economy is losing steam,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. ""While it’s easy to blame the trade tussle with the U.S. for this, the deceleration so far is mostly domestic driven, with infrastructure spending contracting and car sales coming off the boil."" 
 
 Shortly before the data release, China’s top financial officials moved to shore up investor confidence in the country’s tumbling stock market, a rare coordinated show of verbal support that failed to immediately put a floor under the deepest equity sell-off since 2015. 
 Vice Premier Liu He, a key economic adviser to President Xi Jinping, and the heads of the central bank, banking and insurance regulator and securities regulator all issued statements on Friday voicing their support for the market and promising measures to help ease financial pressures on companies, especially those with a high proportion of pledged shares. The officials stopped short of promising direct intervention. 
 ""All sorts of risks and problems accumulated in the past are now emerging, which is an inevitable process and should be viewed rationally,"" Liu said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency. While China’s economy faces difficulties at the moment, it still has ""very bright outlook"" over the longer term, he said. 
 Liu said the trade war has impacted China more psychologically, the government is in touch with the U.S. and ""pays high attention"" to the healthy and steady development of the stock market. 
 Liu also denied the speculation that the private economy is being sidelined while state firms advance. He said there’s ""no such thing,"" adding that the two sectors are interdependent and should cooperate, and it’s ""completely wrong"" for some banks to think it’s safer to lend to state companies than private ones.

What our economists  say ""The slowdown was driven by weakness in the manufacturing sector,"" where  growth slowed to 5.3 percent from 6 percent in the second quarter. ""We see more weakness heading into year-end, as the trade war impact becomes more visible and supportive policies take time to kick in.""-- Chang Shu and Justin Jimenez, Bloomberg Economics

 While growth in total retail sales accelerated in September on a year-over-year basis, that of sales at large retailers slowed to 5.7 per cent, from 6 per cent in August. Auto sales, which make up the largest component of total sales of large retailers, dropped 7.1 per cent from a year earlier in September, the worst decline in data from 2002. 
 The figure for larger companies is based on a complete survey while data on sales at smaller outlets is based on a sample, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
 NBS publishes an official year-over-year growth rate for retail sales as well as a yuan amount. A growth rate calculated based on the yuan amount shows sales were up just 3.7 per cent on a year-over-year basis. The divergence, which NBS says is due to revisions based on the latest census, has led analysts to question the veracity of the data. 
 Slowing Infrastructure Investment 
 Manufacturing investment growth in the nine months through September accelerated to 8.7 per cent over the same period last year, the fastest pace since August 2015. Growth of infrastructure investment fell to 3.3 per cent. It’s decelerated in every month since November 2017. Growth of property development investment ticked down to 9.9 per cent. 
 ""The readings are not looking strong: The full year GDP could be 6.5 percent to 6.6 per cent, based on the trend,"" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore, adding that that would still meet official targets. At the same time, “the leadership is worried about the unstable financial market and the low market confidence. Policies could turn more accommodative and even stimulative in future,"" he said.",,,,

 Gross domestic product probably expanded 6.6 per cent from a year earlier in the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of the report, due Friday morning in Beijing. Forecasters also expect data on retail sales and fixed-asset investment to show growth held steady in September, while growth of industrial production probably ticked a notch lower. 
 The reports will offer details on the state of China’s economy through the end of September, when the U.S. escalated the ongoing trade war. On Sept. 24, the two countries imposed a new round of duties on each other’s exports, with the U.S. pledging to increase them further on January 1, unless an agreement is reached before then. Chinese manufacturers say the current tariff levels are manageable, but that the increases next year would be a game-changer. 
 To better gauge China’s economy, here’s what to watch in the reports: 
 Stronger Trade Boost to GDP 
 Paradoxically, the trade war may be boosting shipments now. The unexpected acceleration of export growth in September should boost the contribution net exports make to the expansion in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected performance was probably thanks to front-loading of shipments to the U.S. ahead of implementation of the new tariffs, according to Betty Wang, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Hong Kong. 
 She flagged a jump in electrical machinery sales in particular -- China’s biggest export to the U.S. -- as partly responsible. 
 But industrial production data show growth in the manufacture of such products has been dropping fast since the middle of last year. The growth rate in August from a year earlier declined to 3.3 percent, the lowest in 12 years of data. 
 If Friday’s data show growth in this area continuing to decelerate, it may confirm the temporary nature of the export boom. 
 Unemployment Rates 
 In the short term, job losses from the effects of the trade war will be a key concern. China will publish two versions of its unemployment rate Friday -- a quarterly measure based on filings for unemployment benefits, which has fallen in recent quarters, and a monthly indicator based on household surveys, which is more akin to measures published in the U.S. and Europe. That one fell in the second quarter before rising again. 
 Investment Handoff 
 Despite the trade war, growth in fixed-asset investment among manufacturers has actually accelerated since the start of the year. Investment in property development has also grown in 2018 at the fastest pace in three years. Infrastructure investment growth, on the other hand, has decelerated from 20 percent last year to just above 4 percent. 
 The question is whether sentiment is strong enough to continue propelling manufacturing investment at that level, and whether recent measures taken by the Chinese government to insulate the economy from trade-war fallout will start to show up in the infrastructure spending data. 
 Infrastructure investment should be a bit better in September ""on the back of accelerated local government special bond issuance,"" Morgan Stanley economists Jenny Zheng, Robin Xing and Cai Zhipeng wrote in an Oct. 10 report. ""However, investment growth in the manufacturing sector has likely moderated due to weaker business sentiment in the face of ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, and property FAI could have softened amid weaker property and land sales."" 
 Auto Sales 
 Retail sales growth has slowed since the beginning of the year, in part thanks to the continued decline in vehicle purchases. Those were about a third of the value of all consumer goods sold in August, when they dropped 3.2 per cent from a year earlier. 
 Total vehicles sold fell 11.6 per cent in September from a year earlier, according to a different data set from the China Automotive Information Network, which doesn’t bode well for the official statistics to be published Friday. 
 Income Versus Consumption 
 In the longer term, China’s task is to transition from an economy based on investment and external demand to one rooted in domestic consumption, and the key to achieving that is boosting labor’s share of income over time. 
 Not only will data on household income growth to be published Friday give an update on how that’s going, but a comparison to household consumption growth will also provide an indirect read on consumer confidence. 
 From the end of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018, growth of disposable income outpaced that of consumption, implying a build-up in household savings. But in the second quarter of this year, the relationship flipped. Whether that continues will be a point of interest.",,,,

 Highlights of Second-Quarter GDP (Third Estimate) 
 -Gross domestic product grew at 4.2 per cent annualized rate, the fastest since 3Q 2014 (matching est.)  
 -Consumer spending, biggest part of the economy, grew at an unrevised 3.8 per cent pace (matching est.); upward revision to gasoline and other energy products, downward revision in transportation services 
 -Gross domestic income, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.6 per cent, revised from a 1.8 per cent gain 
 Key Takeaways 
 The revisions for GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., are largely in sync with more recent data that show the world's largest economy is expanding at a steady, albeit more moderate, pace this quarter. 
 The details were mixed. Inventories subtracted 1.17 percentage point from growth, revised from a previously reported 0.97-point drag, mostly on nonfarm stockpiles. 
 Household purchases, which account for about 70 per cent of the economy, remained the main driver of growth. They contributed 2.57 point, up from a previously estimated 2.55 point. 
 In addition to tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump, a robust job market is helping consumers while strong profits are supporting corporate America. The steady growth rate will offer the White House further opportunity to claim credit for the robust expansion. 
 At the same time, a trade war with China has triggered higher tariffs on imports, supply-chain disruptions, and uncertainty about when the trade tensions may be resolved. Borrowing costs will continue to tick up; the Federal Reserve, which lifted interest rates Wednesday, said growth and job gains have recently been “strong” as it projected further rate hikes over the next year. 
 The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking estimate for third-quarter growth was at 4.4 percent as of last week, while the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists showed a 3 per cent pace. 
 Price data in the report showed inflation is moving in line with the Fed’s 2 per cent goal. Excluding food and energy, the Fed’s preferred price index that is tied to personal spending rose at a 2.1 per cent annualized rate, revised from 2 per cent. 
 Other Details 
 -Corporate pretax profits rose 7.3 per cent from a year earlier, the most since 2016, revised from 7.7 per cent; they climbed 3 per cent from prior quarter, revised from 3.3 per cent 
 -Net exports added 1.22 percentage point to GDP growth, revised from a 1.17-point boost 
 -Nonresidential fixed investment -- which includes spending on equipment, structures and intellectual property -- increased 8.7 per cent, revised from 8.5 per cent; spending on business equipment rose 4.6 per cent, revised from 4.4 per cent 
 -Residential investment declined at a 1.3 per cent rate, revised from 1.6 per cent drop 
 -Government spending increased at a 2.5 per cent rate, revised from a 2.3 percent gain; the figures reflected upward revisions for state and local outlays, primarily in structures, according to the report

 The forecast was made by economists at HSBC Holdings Plc in a new study of 75 nations published on Tuesday. It also saw the Chinese as remaining the single biggest contributor to global growth over the next decade. 
 The projections suggest China’s gross domestic product will stand at US$26 trillion in 2030, up from US$14.1 trillion today. The U.S. meanwhile will see its GDP rise more slowly to US$25.2 trillion from US$20.4 trillion. 
 Just last month, Trump said that China was no longer on track to surpass the U.S. “in a very short period of time.” The HSBC prediction does though gel with that of the International Monetary Fund, which said in July that China could become the world’s largest economy by 2030.

The bank cautions that the increase to growth is actually an accounting illusion, because some of the cannabis-related trade already existed in the economy but wasn’t formally captured in most measures of output. 
 TD raised its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 2.9 per cent, from 2 per cent previously, to incorporate the “level lift” from the inclusion of the weed data, according to a report by authors including Chief Economist Beata Caranci. A smaller lift would follow in the next quarter. The technical changes, coming at the end of the year, would “flatter” the annual growth figures for 2019, said TD, which increased its forecast for the year to 2.2 per cent, from 2 per cent previously.

 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.9 per cent annualized pace from April to June, faster than a 1.4 per cent increase in the first quarter of 2018, Statistics Canada said in a report Thursday from Ottawa. Exports jumped by an annualized 12.3 per cent, the biggest quarterly gain since 2014. 
 Still, the numbers may be a slight disappointment as slowing business investment brought growth in below analyst forecasts -- a development that may also give the Bank of Canada pause about speeding up interest-rate hikes. 
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Growth comes in at 2.9 per cent, slightly less than expectations of 3.1 per cent. Business investment growth is slowest since end of 2016, while exports post biggest rise in four years led by energy Monthly GDP was unchanged in June due to Suncor power outage 
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had anticipated a 3.1 per cent advance in the second quarter, while the central bank had been forecasting a 2.8 per cent gain. 
 Gross business investment -- which had been on a run of late -- was up an annualized 1.5 per cent pace in the second quarter, the slowest since the end of 2016. 
 Gross fixed capital formation -- which includes government investment -- grew by an annualized 0.9 per cent, which is below economist expectations for growth of closer to 4 per cent. Growth in non-residential structures, machinery and equipment slowed to 1.9 per cent from 11.4 per cent in the first quarter. 
 Exports were a big positive and the largest contributor to growth, confirming the sector has stepped onto much more solid footing after struggling for years following the 2008-09 recession. 
 Consumer spending rebounded from a tough start to the year, accelerating at a 2.6 per cent pace in the second quarter, slightly faster than economists predicted. This suggests households are overcoming concerns that had been weighing on spending -- in particular whether the country was in store for a sharp housing slowdown. 
 A correction in housing didn’t materialize however and investment in residential structures rebounded in the second quarter following a sharp decline in the first three months of the year. 
 One negative in the consumption numbers may be that the increased spending was financed by a lower household savings rate.

 -Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, grew 3.8 per cent (est. 3.9 per cent), revised from 4 per cent reflects downward revisions in motor vehicles, nondurable goods, health care

 Key Takeaways 
 The revisions to GDP, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., offer President Donald Trump another chance to stake his claim to the pickup in growth, as he did following the initial GDP report a month earlier. Trump had called the numbers “amazing” and “very sustainable,” declaring his policies, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, a success. 
 Even so, the pace of expansion is expected to cool from the second quarter as the tax-cut boost fades, a trade war threatens business demand and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates further. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project a 2.9 per cent expansion for the full year. 
 Household purchases, which account for about 70 per cent of the economy, have been supported by a strong job market and lower taxes. In addition, a rise in gasoline costs earlier this year has eased, reducing a risk to spending. 
 The continuing acceleration in profit growth suggests corporate America is benefiting from strength in consumer and business demand. That, together with lower taxes, could bode well for further gains in investment this year. 
 Price data in the GDP report showed inflation was in line with the Fed’s 2 percent goal. Excluding food and energy, the central bank's preferred price index that's tied to personal spending rose at a 2 per cent annualized rate, the same as in the initial report. 
 Other Details 
 -Net exports added 1.17 percentage point to GDP growth, revised from a 1.06-point boost; inventories subtracted 0.97 point, compared with the previously reported 1-point drag 
 -Gross domestic income, adjusted for inflation, advanced 1.8 per cent following 3.9 per cent gain

 -Residential investment fell at a 1.6 per cent rate, revised from a 1.1 per cent decline 
 -Final sales to domestic purchasers, which strip out trade and inventories -- the two most volatile components of the GDP calculation -- advanced at 3.9 per cent rate, same as initial reading 
 -Government spending increased at a 2.3 per cent rate, revised from 2.1 per cent; the figures reflected higher spending on defense and by state and local governments; defense spending rose by most since 2009

 Gross domestic product declined 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with the preliminary 0.1 per cent contraction estimate and a 1 per cent expansion in the first quarter, Mexico’s national statistics institute reported on Friday. Non-seasonally adjusted GDP rose 2.6 per cent from a year earlier. 
 While the economy is expected to expand faster this year than in 2017 due to a pickup in spending that preceded the July 1 election, the path ahead is far from smooth. The International Monetary Fund last month cut its forecast for Mexico’s 2019 growth, citing trade tensions as well as uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the president-elect’s policy agenda. 
 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador spurred concern this month by saying he will hold a public referendum on whether to cancel construction of a US$13 billion international airport for Mexico City, the biggest infrastructure work of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration. The group managing the project already suspended some bidding until the president-elect resolves its future. He has said the airport is too expensive and mired in corruption, and, at times, has proposed turning it into a concession or canceling it altogether. 
 The incoming president has also raised eyebrows by saying he will review oil contracts already awarded for signs of potential corruption, and by naming an industry novice to head state-owned crude producer Petroleos Mexicanos, the nation’s largest company. Turning around Pemex will not be easy, given 13 straight years of declining output and a debt load that exceeds US$100 billion. 
 Lopez Obrador also pledges an expansion of public spending on programs for the elderly and youth and an investment of 75 billion pesos (US$4 billion) in the oil industry, financed mainly through cost-cutting and increasing government efficiency. That raises questions among economists about whether he can pay for it all without taking on debt or increasing taxes. 
 Mexico’s economy is expected to grow 2.2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2019, according to analysts in a survey released by Citigroup Inc.’s local unit on Tuesday. The economists see the central bank leaving the key interest rate on hold through the rest of this year and reducing it next year. 
 Service sectors including commercial activity, transportation, financial and media grew 0.2 per cent from the previous three months, compared with a 1 per cent expansion in the first quarter, according to the statistics institute. Industrial sectors including mining, construction and manufacturing declined 0.3 per cent. Agriculture, livestock and fishing industries shrank 2.1 per cent.",,,,

 Gross domestic product increased by 0.5 per cent in May, Statistics Canada said Tuesday from Ottawa, exceeding expectations for a 0.3 per cent gain in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Oil was a key driver, with non-conventional crude output jumping 5.3 per cent as more production came back online after shutdowns. Nineteen of 20 industries showed gains, including retail sales rising 2 per cent on the heels of weakness in April linked to cold weather. 
 ""Essentially, Canadians came out of hibernation in May, and the economy benefitted big-time,"" Douglas Porter, BMO Financial chief economist, wrote in a note to clients. ""We look for much milder activity in June and the second half of 2018, with tariffs kicking in and the Syncrude outage temporarily biting into growth.""  
 The world’s 10th largest economy is now on track for annualized growth of around 3 per cent this quarter, keeping the pressure on the Bank of Canada to consider raising interest rates again to keep inflation in check. The Canadian dollar strengthened as much as 0.4 per cent after the report and was little changed at $1.3036 per U.S. dollar at 9:34 a.m. in Toronto. 
 “Barring bad news on the NAFTA or auto tariff front, the Bank of Canada will be raising rates in October,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, wrote in a research note. 
 Canada’s economy has gained momentum after a weak first quarter with consumer spending supported by a strong labour market and some companies boosting investment as they reach capacity limits. U.S. demand is also factor, with the American economy growing at a 4.1 per cent clip -- the fastest since 2014. 
 “A very solid quarter is possible and that’s consistent with what we saw out of the U.S.,” Benjamin Reitzes, a Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone from Toronto. “When the economy is already at capacity it doesn’t take much to brew inflation even more.” 
 Both Reitzes and Shenfeld said Canada’s economy could grow by about 3 per cent in the second quarter. 
 Investors are putting a one-in-five chance on another rate increase at the Bank of Canada’s next meeting in September, with odds increasing to two-in-three for a move in October. Central bank policy makers raised interest rates this month for the fourth time in a year and said more increases may be needed in a fairly tight economy. 
 The growing trade fight with the U.S. is, however, a wild card. President Donald Trump’s policies are threatening the North American Free Trade Agreement and ratcheting up pressure on other Canadian industries, including lumber and uranium. The uncertainty is holding back some new investment and curbing exports. 
 Companies with strong ties to exporting nevertheless posted increases in May. Transportation and warehousing climbed 0.4 per cent and manufacturing was up 0.1 per cent. 
 Other GDP Highlights 
 - Construction advanced 0.7 per cent in May, another industry that rebounded from a decline linked to cold April weather. 
 - The industry’s output is up 5 per cent in the past year Food services and drinking places saw a 0.9 per cent rise in their value added. 
 - The utilities sector was the lone major category to decline, with a 2.4 per cent drop after a 1.4 per cent gain in April. 
 - The real estate agent and broker sub-category dropped 2.7 per cent in May, the fourth decline this year. 
 - The GDP gain was almost evenly split between a 0.6 per cent increase for goods-producing companies and 0.5 per cent for services.

 Speaking at a steel mill in Granite City, Illinois, on Thursday, Trump doubted the expansion would reach the 5.3 per cent some economists have penciled in, but said that “if it has a four in front of it, we’re happy.” He called recent economic figures “unthinkable.” 
 Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2 per cent annualized rate in the April-June period, according to the Bloomberg survey median, with forecasts ranging as high as 5 per cent. The Commerce Department will release the statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET in Washington. 
 Among the forces behind the pickup from 2 per cent growth in the first quarter is the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era boosting company and corporate spending. The traditionally volatile categories of inventories and trade also probably lifted the number -- helped by a likely temporary jump in soybean exports ahead of retaliatory tariffs 
 Analysts aren’t convinced the acceleration will last, predicting solid yet less spectacular growth in the second half of the year as the tax stimulus begins to fade, the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs again and the expansion ages. The simmering trade war with China will also weigh on the economy. 
 At Bloomberg Economics, economists Carl Riccadonna and Tim Mahedy estimate growth of 3.8 per cent in the quarter. “This reflects a number of one-time idiosyncratic factors and should not be viewed as an indication of what is to come in the second half,” they wrote in a report. 
 Trump said a number just short of 4 percent would also “OK.”",,,,

 “As the trade deals come in one-by-one, we’re going to go a lot higher than these numbers, and these are great numbers,” Trump said Friday at the White House. 
 The Commerce Department said Friday that the economy accelerated to a 4.1 per cent pace of growth in the second quarter, the fastest since 2014. The numbers give Trump a chance to highlight his policy victories, including the biggest tax overhaul since the Reagan era, which probably boosted consumer spending and business investment. 
 Yet, even as he touted the benefits of future trade deals, analysts say the risks from tariff wars and a fading effect from tax cuts could limit the pace of growth going forward. 
 Trump said the pace of growth was “very sustainable” and could create as many as 12 million jobs over the next decade. 
 During his campaign, Trump regularly promised that GDP would grow above 4 per cent annually -- at times saying that the number would go as high as 6 or 7 per cent. Trump claimed that such a rate of economic growth would help reduce the deficit.",,,,

 Gross domestic product expanded 0.1 per cent from the prior month, Statistics Canada reported Friday in Ottawa. Economists had been expecting a flat reading due to the impact of poor weather conditions in April and following a disappointing run of economic data for the month. 
 The economy now is on track for growth to accelerate -- at least in the second quarter -- to beyond 2 per cent, which should reinforce expectations the Bank of Canada will proceed with interest-rate increases in the second half of this year. The report marks a third consecutive month of gains -- including strong advances of 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent in March and February. 
 “We’ve passed the first of three hurdles remaining for the Bank of Canada decision on July 11,” Frances Donald, senior economist, Manulife Asset Management, said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg. ""GDP has come in – that’s certainly enough to check the box for the Bank of Canada and a July rate hike.”  
 She noted the Bank of Canada's Business Outlook Survey, which came out at 10:30 a.m. ET Friday, and Canadian jobs numbers next week would provide further indication to what the central bank will decide July 11.  
 “All in all, these numbers that you’re telling me right now say it’s a go for a July rate hike.” Donald said.  
 “While readily acknowledging that a 0.1 per cent rise in headline GDP is not going to send many hearts racing, this actually was a decent result in a challenging month for the economy,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors. “Importantly, it suggests that growth was pretty much in line with the Bank of Canada’s underlying expectations through the spring. ” 
 The Canadian dollar advanced after the report, gaining 0.5 per cent to $1.3184 per U.S. dollar at 9:23 a.m in Toronto trading. Investors increased odds for a rate increase on July 11 to about 84 per cent. 
 BAD RUN   
 Canada’s economy is coming off a run of three consecutive quarters of disappointing growth readings of below 2 per cent. 
 Manufacturing was up 0.8 per cent in April, which may be the biggest surprise given earlier factory sales data showed sharp declines during the month. Statistics Canada reconciled the discrepancy by saying much of the production ended up as inventory, which suggests a correction may be in store for the sector as those inventories get wound down. Both durable and non-durable manufacturing posted gains. 
 The real estate sector -- which has struggled amid a slumping housing market -- continues to show signs of stabilization. Real estate agent and broker activity was up 0.5 per cent during the month, the biggest gain since tighter mortgage regulations were implemented at the start of the year. 
 Unseasonably cold weather in April also had an impact on the numbers, in both directions. It helped activity at utilities, which saw a 1.6 percent gain during the month, but hurt retail activity, which was down 1.3 per cent. 
 Other GDP Highlights 
 Transportation and warehousing services were down, led by a 2.3 per cent drop in rail transportation, in part due to fewer car loadings of manufactured products Oil and gas extraction also showed surprising strength, up 0.6 per cent, driven by higher output of conventional crude. Oil sands output was down 0.1 per cent due to maintenance of some facilities Mining excluding oil and gas dropped 9.1 per cent, with Statistics Canada citing a labor disruption in iron ore mining Construction was down 0.5 per cent in April, the largest decline in a year.

 KEY TAKEAWAYS 
 The smaller gain in first-quarter services spending primarily reflected fewer outlays by non-profits for health care. The downward revision to inventories was attributable to retail stockpiles, while annual updates to government trade data showed fewer exports and more imports during the quarter, according to Commerce. 
 A report Wednesday on the May merchandise trade deficit showed the narrowest gap in nine months, driven by a boost in exports. As a result, several economists revised their second-quarter tracking estimates for second-quarter growth. At the same time, there’s a risk that U.S. tariffs could have a modest impact on future growth. 
 The economy has shown clear signs of accelerating from the first-quarter slowdown in GDP, which measures the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. The first quarter is also typically influenced by seasonal quirks. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow tracking estimate for second-quarter growth was almost 4.5 per cent as of Wednesday, while the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 3.4-per-cent pace. 
 Notably, consumer spending has shown signs of awakening from a winter slumber as higher take-home pay from lower taxes and gradually rising wages in a robust labor market bolster Americans’ financial positions. 
 A separate report Thursday showed that jobless claims rose in the week ended June 23 for the first time in five weeks. Applications increased by 9,000 to 227,000, a level that remains consistent with a tight labour environment.

 Gross domestic product expanded 0.4 per cent during the month following a 0.1 per cent contraction in January, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday in Ottawa. Economists anticipated a 0.3 per cent gain. 
 “It’s really nice to see a three-handle, said Lyle Stein, senior portfolio manager and managing director at Vestcap Investment Management, of the GDP numbers in an interview with BNN Bloomberg. “The fact is we had that soft period. It puts into doubt the fact that we might be going into a greater slowdown.” 
 The bounce back provides some reassurance the economy is poised to emerge from a recent soft patch of growth, particularly given broad-based gains in key sectors such as manufacturing and signs that rail bottlenecks may be dissipating. 
 Most economists forecast the economy grew by less than 2 per cent in the first quarter, before returning to above-2 per cent growth for the rest of the year. 
 The Bank of Canada estimates first-quarter growth of 1.3 per cent, before the expansion accelerates to well above 2 per cent in the second quarter. 
 The GDP numbers for the first two months suggest there is potential for an upside surprise in the first quarter, with the economy tracking just under an annualized 2 per cent pace currently. 
 “I wouldn’t get too excited – I don’t think this is anything to write home about, but at least we’re getting some growth as we move through the first quarter of the year,” said Derek Burleton, VP and deputy chief economist, TD Bank Group, in an interview with BNN Bloomberg.  “I think the second quarter is going to be better.”

 The loonie fell 0.40 per cent to US$1.2888 per U.S. dollar at 10:30 a.m. in Toronto, extending its year-to-date loss to 2.5 per cent, the worst performance among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency has weakened in 10 of the last 11 sessions. 
 The Canadian dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks on concerns that negotiators will fail to reach an agreement to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Donald Trump added to trade worries Thursday, pledging to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminum. Canada is the largest exporter of steel to the U.S. 
 Meanwhile, data out on Friday showed Canada’s economy decelerated more than expected in the second half of last year, amid signs indebted households have begun to curb spending. The economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada reported, versus economist expectations for 2 per cent growth. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth was also revised down. 
 Even as the loonie broke above its 200-day moving average this week, reinforcing the notion there’s more weakness to come, some market watchers believe the currency has sold off too much. 
 “A lot of bad news is priced in to the Canadian dollar at these levels,” said Shaun Osborne, Toronto-based chief foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia. While the White House imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports “might be seen as a negative for the Canadian dollar initially, we think erecting trade barriers would work against the U.S. dollar in the longer run.” 
 The Bank of Canada will make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday after increasing the key rate three times since mid-2017 to 1.25 per cent. All 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the rate to stay unchanged, with the market pricing in two to three more hikes later this year, according to overnight index swaps data. The odds of a rate hike for April have declined to 37 per cent, from more than 60 per cent last month.",,,,

 The economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada reported Friday, versus economist expectations for 2 per cent growth. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth was also revised down to 1.5 per cent from an initial estimate of 1.7 per cent. 
 The data not only show the slowdown is well underway, which was expected, but an economy that isn’t even growing above its so- called potential growth level. 
 That’s a surprise since most economists were expecting Canadian growth would continue to run slightly above its noninflationary speed limit for at least another year, leading to price pressures that would prompt the Bank of Canada to keep hiking interest rates. 
 ""The main message though is that the exciting growth from the middle of 2016 up until the middle of 2017 is now truly in the past, and the economy is back to the drudgery of slogging out something closer to potential of around 2 per cent. With trade uncertainties mounting and inflation still reasonably well behaved, this gives the Bank of Canada plenty of leeway to stay cautious,"" wrote Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group in a note to clients.  
 Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, told BNN current risks like possible U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and uncertainty around NAFTA are tilted to the downside for Canada's economy. 
 “Things are tilted to the downside. I think that the Bank of Canada is going to be pretty cautious in how it moves forward and how quickly it raises rates,” he told BNN in an interview Friday.   
 What may be worse is that fourth-quarter GDP figures were exaggerated by temporary factors in housing. Spending on residential structures surged in the last three months of 2017 to an annualized 13.4 per cent, the strongest quarterly increase since 2012. The gain was led by stronger-than-expected new home construction, and as buyers rushed to get ahead of tighter mortgage qualification rules that came into effect Jan. 1. 
 The increase in residential spending was responsible for 1 percentage point of the 1.7 per cent growth rate, Statistics Canada said. Residential investment had been a drag on growth the previous two quarters. 
 Statistics Canada did revise up growth estimates for the first half of the year to 4.2 per cent, from an initially reported 4 per cent. 
 The second half slowdown was driven in large part by household spending, with consumption growth in the fourth quarter at the slowest pace since 2016.

 Bank of Canada to remain cautious on rates, lower loonie to benefit Canada for now: Economist 
 BNN speaks with Randall Bartlett, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy about the latest Canadian GDP numbers — the first significant piece of economic data since the release of Ottawa's latest budget. 
 
 Other highlights of the GDP report: 
 -Statistics Canada reported GDP for the month of December rose 0.1 per cent, in line with analyst expectations 
 -Monthly GDP was also driven higher by the housing market gains, which helped offset a drop in construction and manufacturing 
 -GDP expanded by 3.0 per cent last year, the fastest pace since 2011 
 -Exports recovered in the fourth quarter, with an annualized 3 per cent gain, after plunging in the third quarter. Still, that wasn’t enough to keep the trade sector from being a drag on growth with imports up 6.3 per cent 
 -The slowdown in household spending is due in part to a higher saving rate, which increased to 4.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, from 4 per cent in the third quarter 
 -Businesses continued to add inventories in the fourth quarter, but less than they did in the third quarter. The drop in inventory accumulation reduced growth by 0.7 percentage points 
 -Non-residential business investment accelerated in the fourth quarter, up 8.2 per cent on an annualized basis
