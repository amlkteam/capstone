Druckenmiller on Tuesday called a V-shaped recovery — the idea the economy will quickly snap back as the coronavirus pandemic eases — a “fantasy.” Tepper said Wednesday that next to 1999, equities are overvalued the most he’s ever seen.It’s a notion catching on among Wall Street money managers. And it’s coming as investors start to suspect that the Federal Reserve’s support, as well as US$3 trillion in Treasury stimulus, may not be enough to compensate for soaring unemployment, a wave of bankruptcies and no end in sight to the pandemic. Managers including Bill Miller, Paul Singer and Paul Tudor Jones have all voiced doubts about markets or the economy.Such bearishness starkly contrasts with the optimism that pushed the S&P 500 Index up 26 per cent from its March low. And the warnings have caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who’s facing re-election and has seen his plans to run on a booming economy shredded by the virus. Trump attacked “so-called ‘rich guys’” in a tweet Wednesday.“You must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down,” Trump wrote about the stock market. “Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways.”When the so-called “rich guys” speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?His criticism is unlikely to sway Wall Street professionals. The S&P 500 Index is down 3.8 per cent this week, and investors and economists are forecasting further declines amid a prolonged struggle to right the economy.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Trump’s pick for the job, outlined a doom-laden scenario with mass bankruptcies and unemployment in a speech delivered around the same time as the president’s tweet. Powell said policymakers may have to do more to prevent long-term damage to the economy.Tepper’s comments were a change from late March, when he said he was “nibbling” at stocks, buying into companies focused on technology or hospitals and health care. Tepper, who runs the US$13-billion Appaloosa hedge fund, told CNBC on Wednesday that valuations are “nuts” for some individual stocks on the Nasdaq. He also highlighted banks and airlines as difficult areas in which to invest right now.Druckenmiller said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York that his analysis showed liquidity that drove markets higher will soon shrink as Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases. The 66-year-old said he’s never seen a time when the risk of owning stocks so outweighed the potential gain.When reached by phone on Wednesday, billionaire Leon Cooperman pointed to an email he wrote in late April that predicted the government’s actions to combat the pandemic will lead to higher taxes and more regulation. He estimated the S&P 500 should be trading lower — somewhere between 2,200 to 2,800 — which suggests stocks could fall as much as 22 per cent.“I’m 77 years old and I’ve never seen this level of uncertainty,” Cooperman said in the phone interview. “This cycle is different than the other seven bear market cycles I lived through because this is the only one where we had a broad scale shut down of the economy, which I view as a mistake.”I'm 77 years old and I've never seen this level of uncertaintyCooperman warned that the longer the economy remains shut, the greater the risk of a depression.Other marquee investors also have taken more defensive stances recently. Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corp., told clients in early May he was investing in gold and had even put a small percentage of his firm’s assets in Bitcoin as he looked for havens. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn said in late April that he wasn’t buying stocks. Instead, he was hoarding cash and shorting commercial real estate.Stock-picker Miller said in an email he’s changed his mind about the market’s prospects for the near future.“The buying opportunity I talked about on CNBC on March 18 did not last as long as I thought it would,” Miller said. “After being up about 30 per cent from the low on March 23, I would think a pause and some consolidation is in order.” He predicted the S&P 500 could fall 4 per cent or 5 per cent from its current level.A few of the more bearish hedge fund managers already sounded the alarm earlier this year. Crispin Odey told clients in a March update that “nothing is immune from the slowdown.”“By all means buy your favourite shares, I am not going to put you off,” he wrote. “But know that from here on you are now on the wrong side of history.”Singer, the founder of Elliott Management, who on Feb. 1 told his staff to prepare for quarantines, told clients in mid-April — while stocks were soaring — that the outlook for equities was dire. Global stock markets could fall 50 per cent or more from their February top, he said.It’s not just fund managers. Billionaire Mark Cuban, who is part of a group chosen by Trump last month to help advise on reopening the economy, said he agreed with Druckenmiller about equities.“Stocks are overvalued and the risk-reward isn’t there till we see a cohesive plan for testing from the government,” Cuban said in an email.Bloomberg.com"

Euro-area bonds declined with Treasuries. West Texas oil futures dropped, halting a three-day 60 per cent rally, though they pared most of their decline.Global stocks begin the week declining for a third straight session, a streak not seen in almost two months, as U.S.-China discord flared again and President Donald Trump prodded the nation to reopen for business.

The TSX was down 160 point at 14,620.Equities also retreated in the U.K., one of the few open markets in Europe as other countries celebrated May Day, and the pound gave back some of this week’s gains as Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged a “comprehensive plan” to lift the country’s lockdown, with details due next week.While the S&P 500 posted its best month since 1987 in April — spurred by a slowdown in coronavirus infections and $8 trillion in promised stimulus initiatives globally — earnings reports and economic data are serving a reminder of lasting pain. Amazon warned of a possible second-quarter loss, while Apple omitted an earnings forecast for the first time in more than a decade. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan warned of a “severe” contraction from the effects of coronavirus.“Earnings continued to be a minefield,” said Bryce Doty, portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates Inc. “You don’t really know what is going to happen because there is so little clarity.”The advance in the dollar followed U.S. President Donald Trump reviving an attack on China, speculating it could have spread the coronavirus and threatening trade tariffs.

 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government will restrict the entry of all non-residents into Canada except Americans, while U.S. President Donald Trump urged social distancing and schools and restaurant services across North American will shut down to fight the pandemic. 
 The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 9.9 per cent to the lowest level since February, 2016, bringing its losses to 31 per cent from the Feb. 20 peak. U.S. stocks plunged the most since 1987 after Trump warned the economic disruption from the virus could last into summer. 
 Ten of eleven sectors fell on the Canada benchmark, while materials closed in the green. Air Canada, shares fell 28 per cent today alone on the government travel ban and is now down 62 per cent this year. 
 Dramatic rate cuts from global central banks, including the Fed on Sunday and the Bank of Canada on Friday, appear to have done little to calm investors who see global growth virtually grinding to a halt. Royal Bank of Canada was the first to cut its prime rate to 2.95 per cent from 3.45 per cent, matching the Canadian central bank’s cut. 
 Oil’s spectacular collapse deepened, with West Texas Intermediate futures settling under US$29 per barrel in New York as widening global efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus looked set to trigger the most severe contraction in annual demand in history. 
 Gold extended losses after its worst week in almost four decades, with investors “selling whatever they can” as the widening economic impact of the coronavirus spurred panic across markets. Gold and silver equities however, defied slumps in their respective commodities, led by a jump in levered ETFs, which saw massive weakness and volatility last week. 
 The Bank of Canada will likely take the overnight rate to 0.25 per cent from 0.75 per cent ahead of the next scheduled decision on April 15, according economists from Bloomberg Intelligence. 
 Given the extent of pandemic-driven unknowns, the central bank may want to pull a page from the Fed’s emergency playbook and jettison the forecasting exercise over the near term. 
 “We continue to recommend investors refrain from buying the dips, and carrying above-average exposure to gold equities, even amid recent weakness in the commodity,” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce portfolio strategists including Ian de Verteuil wrote in a note to clients early Monday. 
 CIBC is among banks calling for a recession this year domestically along with in the United States. Royal Bank of Canada thinks the country will fall into a recession this year after taking a double hit from falling oil prices and the global impact of coronavirus on economic activity. Meanwhile, Bank of America said Friday Canada will experience negative GDP growth during the second and third quarters of this year."

The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.Exchanges operated by TMX stopped trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time. Major U.S. benchmarks dropped more than 4 per cent after falling sharply in the last hour of trading.TMX Group will be left with a “black eye,” Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities Ltd. and chairman of the rival Canadian Securities Exchange, said in a phone interview. “It’s a terrible thing to happen, particularly in a cataclysmic market that we’re currently experiencing this week that people either want to trade, need to trade, want to get out or want to get in.”Toronto-based TMX had said in a series of tweets that clients were not able to enter, modify or cancel any open orders on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture and TSX Alpha exchanges. At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives. The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group’s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.“I don’t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,” said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. “Volume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,” Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues “but it’s not impossible to trade,” she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. “Rest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,” he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission. TMX will likely be asked what measures are being put in place so it doesn’t happen again, he added. Bloomberg.com"

Shares of Textron also surged as analysts said a deal would strengthen its hand in the luxury-aircraft business.The negotiations have been going on for several weeks, and the terms of the potential transaction are unclear, the Journal reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. There’s no guarantee that the discussions will result in any agreement, the newspaper said. Bombardier declined to comment. Textron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A deal would provide a welcome cash injection for debt-laden Bombardier while removing what was supposed to be a pillar of its future. Once a Canadian industrial champion, Bombardier has also been holding talks to combine its rail-equipment unit with France’s Alstom SA and is considering an exit from a joint venture with Airbus SE to make the A220 jetliner. Bombardier agreed last year to sell its regional-jet business to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, valued Bombardier’s private-jet business at US$6.7 billion. She said other makers of luxury aircraft would benefit from stronger pricing power if the Montreal-based company reached a deal with Textron, the maker of Cessna planes.“Given the market deliveries have been stagnant around the 650 unit mark, consolidation has always been a possibility,” Kahyaoglu said in a note. “We would assume consolidation would lead to increased price discipline.”Bombardier jumped 10 per cent to $1.43 at 2:26 p.m. in Toronto. The shares fell 33 per cent this year through Monday, the worst drop on Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index, after Bombardier warned of disappointing fourth-quarter sales. The company also said it may exit the A220 program and warned of a possible writedown.The company’s 7.85 per cent bonds due 2027 climbed 1.3 US cents to 97 US cents on the dollar, yielding 8.5 per cent, according to Trace data.Textron rose 7.8 per cent to US$49.88 after advancing as much as 11 per cent, the most intraday in nine months.Bombardier’s rail talks with Alstom have slowed down, partly over the valuation of an operation that has had production stumbles, the Journal said.The Canadian company’s openness to selling its private-jet business signals a weaker outlook for its rail operation, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson. A deal with Textron would probably include Bombardier’s Global and Challenger lines of luxury aircraft.The Textron negotiation “affirms our view that rail cash flow will be weak over the next few years, requiring divestment of assets to pay down debt with maturities beginning in mid-2021,” Ferguson said in a report. “We expect a sale would include large jets such as the Global and Challenger lines, as Lear won’t garner much cash.”–With assistance from Sandrine Rastello and Thomas Black."

They were right. And they were correct to predict Canadian stocks would outperform the U.S.What they couldn’t foresee was a viral outbreak that has roiled global markets. While it’s too early to assess the full impact of the coronavirus, now designated a global health emergency, it will have economic repercussions in Canada.China is the second-largest market for Canadian products, according to Bloomberg data. It purchased about $27 billion (US$20 billion) in goods from Canada in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Canada exported $22 billion worth of goods to China in the first 11 months of 2019, representing 4 per cent of total shipments abroad. China is also Canada’s largest source of tourist arrivals from the Asia-Pacific region with a record 737,000 Chinese tourists in 2018, according to state agency Destination Canada.A third case of coronavirus was confirmed in Ontario on Jan. 31, bringing the total number to four in Canada. A woman in her 20s arrived from Wuhan via Toronto on Jan. 23 and went to London, Ontario, developing symptoms a day later. She was first tested negative, but a second test confirmed the virus.Uncertainty about the severity and duration of the outbreak has left economists and analysts making best-guess estimates. Many are reaching back to the SARS outbreak of 2003 for pointers on how things could play out, but China’s economy is now 10 times larger compared with 17 years ago. On Monday, China’s stock market opened to the most savage wave of selling in years, with thousands of shares falling by the daily limit after just minutes of trading.Canada’s economy will see the spillover effects of this pandemic “but the impact looks likely to be limited relative to the 2003 SARS outbreak,” Nathan Janzen, a Royal Bank of Canada senior economist, said in a report. China-Canada bilateral travel will decline, he said, though “risks to total Canadian travel inflows will still look smaller than SARS, at least for now.”The loonie has weakened against the greenback since the new virus began making headlines as the price of oil slumped, bonds rallied and Canada’s stock market dropped (albeit at a smaller scale versus the U.S. thanks to gold stocks). And as earnings season picks up pace in earnest north of the border, Canadian firms are discussing the impact the virus will have on their bottom line.Teck Resources Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay said that if the coronavirus follows the pattern of SARS, there will be a two- to six-month period in which it will affect the perception of commodities demand. He added that once things get back to normal, it will present a buying opportunity.Resolute Forest Products Inc.’s CEO Yves Laflamme said in a phone interview that virus outbreaks are “never good for the economy,” and demand in China, a large consumer of lumber and pulp, may ebb should the impact last for an extended period.Sun Life Financial Inc. has asked employees who travelled to mainland China recently to work from home for two weeks before returning to the office, with similar to steps taken by Bank of Montreal and Manulife Financial Corp.Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, suspended all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai until Feb. 29. Its shares have slumped about 15 per cent since a peak earlier this month.Magna International Inc., which has 55 manufacturing and assembly units in China and has a 10th of its workforce there, has banned travel to the country, according to media reports. Magna could also take a hit as carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. halted some production.Canada Goose Inc. is slated to report third-quarter results on Feb. 7. Investors will want to know how the viral outbreak has impacted sales in China and Hong Kong and whether this will be reflected in any year-end forecasts. The luxury winter apparel retailer has two stores in Hong Kong, one in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenyang each.At least eight Canadian-listed companies generate 100 per cent of their revenue from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First Quantum Minerals Ltd. received more than 35 per cent of its 2018 sales from China, and Mississauga, Ontario-based Imax Corp., which is listed in the U.S., gets a third.Canada’s economy unexpectedly expanded in November as cold weather drove a sharp increase in power usage, though the pickup won’t be enough to salvage what is likely to be a weak end to the year. Gross domestic output rose 0.1 per cent in November, beating economists’ estimates for a flat reading, Statistics Canada reported on Jan. 31. That follows a 0.1% contraction in the prior month.Employment data from January is due Feb. 7.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the new NAFTA in a call with Donald Trump. Trudeau “raised the arbitrary detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China, and the two leaders agreed on the need for their immediate release,” according to a readout from Trudeau’s office issued on Jan. 31. They also discussed the coronavirus outbreak and “global health emergency and measures being taken by both countries to protect the health and safety of their citizens.”Bloomberg.com"

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It’s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.“It is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,” Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. “On the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.”The remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada’s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation’s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy’s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.On trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.“We are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,” said Poloz. “In this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.”Outside of trade, Poloz said the country’s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation’s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation’s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn’t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"

First announced in an interview with Economist in January 2016, the IPO came after a tumultuous period that included the murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of prominent Saudis in Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton. The sale ultimately fell short of the US$100 billion international offering with a valuation of US$2 trillion that the prince once proposed.Saudi officials pulled out all the stops to ensure that the stock traded higher after an offering that international investors largely rejected, citing the valuation and concerns including governance issues and possible security threats. The stock price also should be underpinned by demand from index-tracking funds, since Aramco will be added to emerging-market benchmarks.“Aramco should easily get to the US$2 trillion valuation as soon as tomorrow; there is plenty of appetite for it,” said Marie Salem, the head of institutions at Daman Securities in Dubai. “And more money should flow soon with the international index inclusions. The start couldn’t be better.”Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, is so big that it easily dwarfs the rest of the companies in the Saudi market, which have a combined value of about US$500 billion. Adding in Aramco at its current market value, the kingdom’s bourse becomes the world’s seventh-biggest stock market, overtaking Canada, Germany and India. Saudi Arabia, though, only sold 1.5 per cent of the company’s capital, meaning that barely any of its shares will trade.Final orders surpassed US$119 billion, with authorities allowing lenders to boost loans beyond usual to support the sale.Not everyone is convinced the share price surge will last. Many international investors are avoiding the stock because of environmental, social and governance concerns, while others say the company is overvalued given its dividend yield versus peers.“Fundamentally, especially when taking ESG considerations into account, the valuation is stretched,” said Siddharth Sanghvi, head of emerging markets equity research at Amundi.Aramco has promised a bumper dividend payment of a minimum US$75 billion a year until at least 2024. That implies a yield of about 3.9 per cent, much less generous than peers BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yet also high enough to threaten to stretch the company’s finances if crude prices fall.Aramco’s IPO relied on some of the kingdom’s richest families, who had members detained in the Ritz hotel during a so-called crackdown on corruption in 2017, and also on cash from neighbouring allies such as the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. Gulf Cooperation Council investors are confident the stock price has plenty of room to increase, boosted by incentives that go from bonus shares to the fast inclusion in emerging-market benchmarks.Wealthy Saudis were pressed to buy shares after the start of trading to make the IPO a success, the Financial Times reported Tuesday.A surge in early trading validates “our thesis that Aramco’s pricing fell short of US$2 trillion to leave upside on the table for Saudi and GCC investors, allowing them to benefit from the listing of Saudi’s crown jewel,” said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd., which bought shares in the IPO through three funds.Goldman Sachs Group Inc., acting as share stabilizing manager, has the right to exercise an option to sell another 450 million shares. It could be executed in whole or in part up to 30 calendar days after trading begins. The previous largest IPO, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., rose 38 per cent in its trading debut in 2014.The Aramco IPO proceeds will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund, which has made a number of bold investments, including into SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund and a US$3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies Inc. Saudi authorities flagged this week that “a lot” of the money will be spent in the domestic economy.The proceeds of the Aramco deal alone are equal to more than a decade of IPOs on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, which has already said that the company’s weighting in the main local benchmark will be capped at 15 per cent. And even though Aramco’s free float is among the lowest globally, the deal opens up one of the world’s most secretive companies, one that bankrolled Saudi Arabia and its rulers for decades, but until this year had never published financial statements or borrowed in international debt markets. Bloomberg.com"

The lender has raised the bar each year since 2011 in terms of annual earnings, and fourth-quarter net income helped make fiscal 2019 no exception.Yet the pace is cooling, with the year’s 3.5 per cent earnings increase to $12.9 billion making for the slowest annual growth in a decade. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates.The lender’s RBC Capital Markets division posted $584 million in profit, down 12 per cent and its lowest total in two years. Investment banking fees fell 17 per cent to $428 million in what’s been a tough year for dealmaking. The value of global mergers and acquisitions is down 15 per cent from a year ago amid fewer deals, while equity financings are about 6 per cent lower, hurting fee pools across the industry.Royal Bank is one of Canada’s most diversified banks, with worldwide operations in asset management and capital markets and ownership of Los Angeles-based City National Bank. Yet Canadian personal and commercial banking remains the lender’s biggest division.Earnings from Canadian banking rose 6.3 per cent to $1.56 billion in the quarter.The Toronto-based lender has expanded mortgage balances by about 5 per cent each quarter from year-earlier periods, outperforming rivals. Domestic mortgage balances rose 7.3 per cent, the biggest year-over-year increase since 2016, to a record $265 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.Royal Bank’s $5 billion takeover of City National in 2015 has helped lift wealth management revenue over the past four years. Profit from wealth management rose 32 per cent to $729 million.Royal Bank shares have risen 15 per cent this year through Tuesday, compared with a 13 per cent gain for Canada’s eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Fourth-quarter net income fell 1.4 per cent to $3.21 billion, or $2.18 a share, its first decline since the first quarter of 2018.

The cuts will affect about 5 per cent of Bank of Montreal’s workforce, executives said on a fiscal fourth-quarter conference call Tuesday. That would equate to about 2,300 positions, based on the company’s year-end headcount.“This is a sizable move,” Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said on the call, while announcing earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. “We’re on a new path as far as a continuous improvement of the operating efficiency of the bank and this charge is designed to accelerate that path as we go forward.”The latest restructuring charge — which follows one taken in the second quarter of 2018, also tied to severances — included a small amount of real-estate related costs and is part of White’s efforts to improve productivity at what has been Canada’s least-efficient bank. The company’s adjusted efficiency ratio, a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue, was 60 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 62.2 per cent a year earlier, as the lender moves toward White’s target of 58 per cent or better by the end of fiscal 2021.“It is difficult for us to credit good expense control in the face of yet another restructuring charge from this bank, this time approaching $500 million,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in a note to clients. “However, the underlying segment performance was solid with improving volume growth, positive operating leverage and stable credit quality. A decent result.”Bank of Montreal shares fell 1.8 per cent to $98.88 at 9:38 a.m. in Toronto. They have gained 11 per cent this year, compared with a 13 per cent increase for Canada’s eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.The job cuts are across all areas of the bank and are deeper than previous rounds of reductions, including the elimination of 1,850 jobs, or 4 per cent of the workforce, in May 2016, and the 1,000 positions cut in 2007. The latest move comes about six months after the Toronto-based company pared about 100 jobs across its capital-markets division.The reductions surpass Bank of Nova Scotia’s 1,500 job cuts, announced in 2014, and the 1,660 positions eliminated by Royal Bank of Canada in 2004. Those were among the Canadian banking industry’s biggest cuts in the past two decades.Bank of Montreal’s restructuring costs contributed to a 30 per cent decline in net income in the quarter, with the company posting earnings of $1.19 billion, or $1.78 a share. Adjusted per-share earnings were $2.43, beating the $2.41 average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank raised its quarterly dividend 2.9 per cent to $1.06 a share.Wealth management led profit growth in the quarter, with a 22 per cent increase in earnings from the year earlier, while Canadian and U.S. banking also gained.

With valuations expanding and fund managers turning “euphoric,” investors should watch out for a market retreat that’s bound to occur by the end of March, she warned.“We expect 2020 to be a year of moderation, turbulence, and transition in the U.S. equity market,” Calvasina wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “Risk of a pullback near-term is quite high in our opinion. If a pullback doesn’t occur by the end of 2019, as we’ve anticipated, then we suspect it will come in 1Q20.”Calvasina is the latest Wall Street strategist to warn that the momentum behind the S&P 500 will be hard to sustain after a 25 per cent surge in the first 11 months of this year. While Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have emboldened bulls, allowing them to look past stagnant growth, the economy still hasn’t shown the signs of an acceleration that would underpin a revival in corporate profits. The 2020 presidential election is also likely to create volatility in a market that’s already routinely being whipsawed by trade headlines.Among strategists tracked by Bloomberg who have provided their forecasts for next year, three expect the S&P 500 to be lower in 13 months than it is today. Even the most optimistic, Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse, projected gains running at less than half the rate seen so far in 2019. His target stands at 3,425, implying a 9 per cent increase.The way Calvasina sees it, the S&P 500’s latest breakout to new highs has prompted institutional investors to pile into equities. Fear of missing out is evident in the futures market, with asset managers boosting exposure above levels that had spelled trouble for stocks. In the previous four instances when their positions were as elevated as now, losses followed, RBC data showed.“This keeps us on guard for a period of significant consolidation near-term, and will be an overhang on 2020 performance if not resolved before year end,” Calvasina wrote.Bloomberg.com"
6,Bloomberg News,Jennifer Parker,Old stock exchange buildings are being turned into swanky hotels,"Stock exchanges aren’t what they used to be. You can tell just by stepping onto the floor of the most powerful one in the world, on Wall Street in New York.",0,,0,,11/27/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/old-stock-exchange-buildings-are-being-turned-into-swanky-hotels-1.1354228,,"Stock exchanges aren’t what they used to be. You can tell just by stepping onto the floor of the most powerful one in the world, on Wall Street in New York. 
 At the start of the century, the New York Stock Exchange employed about 5,000 traders to execute all orders. Today, the only finance professionals who work in the landmarked space also do double duty as extras for bell-ringing ceremonies and programming on CNBC, which leases some of the space. In reality, most of the action of the NYSE, by far the world’s largest exchange measured by market value, happens at its data center across the Hudson River, in Mahwah, N.J. Data centers in New Jersey house the majority of U.S. stock trading activity today. 
 “The physical spaces are just television studios as almost all trading happens in data centers,” says Brad Katsuyama, CEO of The Investors Exchange (IEX), which processes trades at the CenturyLink data center in Weehawken, New Jersey. 
 New York isn’t the only city to decommission its trading floors; cities such as Manchester, Paris, and Vancouver have, too. After Nasdaq pioneered electronic trading in the 1970s, the so-called open outcry on most exchanges gave way to nanosecond, electronic flash trading, leaving professionals to rely on cables and speed rather than shouting within haloed neoclassical or Edwardian edifices. 
 Hoteliers and developers around the world have begun using these architectural showstoppers to draw in the masses to new hotels, museums, and gyms. Owners aren’t just adding a crown jewel to their portfolio, but expecting healthy returns for going through the trouble of updating the historic structures, which typically come with outdated plumbing and heating. 
 “From an investment perspective, introducing a new use to the exchange is a bold move but a wise one,” says Winston Zahra, chief executive officer of GG Hospitality, which opened the Stock Exchange Hotel this month in Manchester, U.K. “Trophy asset? I hate the term, but the reality is these buildings are seen as part of a city’s legacy. There is a feeling of pride.” Its penthouse has a bank vault for a closet. Gold bars serve as part of the décor and the ghosts of traders past appear in sepia-toned photographs along the walls. 
 Call it creative destruction. Though miles apart, each of these exchanges share a common thread. The designers and developers recasting them are abiding by capitalism’s core tenant: leaving behind the vestiges of earlier eras to welcome something new. 
 Here are six exchanges that are having second lives either as high-end hotels, soaring museums, or, in San Francisco, as an Equinox.

 Former Manchester United footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs teamed up with Maltese hotelier Winston Zahra to restore this Edwardian edifice at a cost of £18 million (US$23 million). After five years of planning and renovation work, it opened as the Stock Exchange Hotel in November — feted with a modern-day dinner party that hardly resembled the building’s inauguration in 1906 as a gentleman’s-only, top-hats-and-tails establishment. 
 Its 40 rooms are elegantly outfitted by the Turkish studio Autoban and feature writing desks topped with Italian marble, leather headboards, handcrafted sofas, and freestanding Victoria & Albert bathtubs set on heated tile flooring. English chef Tom Kerridge and executive chef Dan Scott have signed on to run the main restaurant and bar, The Bull & Bear, housed beneath the original dome ceiling of the former trading floor. On the menu are throwback martinis, pints on tap, and British classics such as scotch eggs, Yorkshire Pudding, and crispy pig’s head. Rooms from £200 ($258 USD) 
 Bourse de Commerce, Paris 
 The French are turning their 130-year-old commodities exchange, long forgotten by Parisians, into a contemporary art museum. After multiple delays, Paris will finally open the Bourse de Commerce in June, unveiling a completely transformed interior designed by Japanese Pritzker Prize laureate Tadao Ando. Ando was commissioned by French billionaire François Pinault to create the space in part to house Pinault’s extensive private art collection. “By nesting new spaces within it, while respecting the memories of the city engraved in its walls, I will transform the building’s entire interior into a space for contemporary art,” says Ando on the project’s website. 
 Until a few years ago, the site was occupied by a handful of fonctionnaires from the Chamber of Commerce, who’ve since relocated to a less grandiose office as part of Pinault’s deal with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to rehabilitate the space. Expanding the museum cost $170 million—more than Pinault, a French art legend, spent on either the Palazzo Grassi or the Punta della Dogana in Venice—with much of the budget going to a restoration of the facade. While details of the inaugural exhibition have yet to be announced, the showstoppers will surely be inside. Pinault’s collection comprises some 5,000 works by artists including Cindy Sherman, Albert Oehlen, Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Louise Bourgeois. 
 Exchange Hotel, Vancouver 
 The US$240-million makeover of the neo-Gothic Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE) building at 475 Howe Street took three years—a short time to shake its reputation as the “scam capital of the world,” as the exchange was dubbed by Forbes in 1989. The onetime market, which traded in barely regulated small-cap mining and oil and gas exploration stocks, is now home to the Exchange Hotel. The classic renovation added 20 glass-walled stories with aluminum louvers to create a pinstripe effect, and 202 contemporary rooms with herringbone hardwood floors and bull and bear bronze desk sculptures. In the lobby you’ll find the original hexagon marble flooring and hand-painted ceilings. As for the infamous trading floor — it’s now a brassy, classic cocktail bar called Open Outcry, which slings sidecars and Sazeracs from tableside trolleys. Rooms from $178 
 Bergen Bors Hotel, Norway 
 Opened in 2017, the Bergen Bors Hotel is by all accounts the most fashionable hotel in Bergen, attracting a cosmopolitan crowd to the second-largest city in Norway. Housed in a Renaissance Revival building from 1862, the 127-room hotel occupies the upper floors of the old stock exchange building and has its own take on Scandinavian design, with minimalist furnishings and neutral color palettes. The feel is unquestionably modern, with smart TVs and Nespresso coffee machines. But back in the day, this was a place for merchants to trade shares in each other’s fishery, shipping, and oil companies. 
 After the building became obsolete in the 1990s, it took 250 million Norwegian kroner (US$27 million) of private investment from a family-owned hotel group, De Bergenske, to bring it back to life. “You have to develop these properties into more relevant businesses — and in Bergen, we have strong tourism,” says CEO Kjetil Smørås. Rooms from NOK 1,540 ($169 USD) 
 Equinox, San Francisco 
 You may not be able to sleep there, but you can certainly break a sweat at the San Francisco Stock Exchange building at 301 Pine Street — it’s now an Equinox gym. The fitness outpost was among the earliest of these conversions, dating to 2004. The renovation maintained the 1930s-era Moderne style exterior and Yule marble facade, while swapping the brokers’ old workstations for sleek ellipticals, tech-friendly spin bikes, a yoga studio, pilates studio, juice bar, and spa. 
 For Equinox, the building’s prime location in San Francisco’s Financial District, known as North FiDi, is more important than its 124-year history of trading through the California gold rush and the Great Depression. Today the gym offers “convenient access for corporate clientele,” a company representative says. Once a capitalist’s temple, always a capitalist’s temple. 
 123 Greenwich Street, New York City 
 The former American Stock Exchange building — aka the Amex, once a rival of the NYSE — is now a real estate project titled 123 Greenwich Street. Headed by GHC Development, the US$65 million plan to repurpose the building was announced in January 2018 as a joint venture with Clarion Partners that comprises offices, retail space, and by 2021, a high-end boutique hotel. “This is a crown jewel property with a wow factor that cannot be replicated,” says GHC’s real estate developer Allan Fried. He’s seeking office tenants and a boutique hotel that’s the right fit, offering about 174 rooms and an aesthetic “along the lines of The Beekman,” he says. “We want to retain as much of a historic perspective as possible, keeping intact the landmarked limestone exterior. For instance, the trading floor has a 60 foot ceiling height. We’re not bastardizing that. The beauty of such a space is not re-created today.” 
 Regardless of which brand signs on, the future hotel will be near all manner of attractions in Manhattan’s financial district, including the One World Observatory at the World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, Nobu Downtown, and the shops at Brookfield Place. Developers also plan to host more retail events at 123 Greenwich Street similar to last January’s “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez” exhibition for Louis Vuitton. In the future, the trading most likely to happen at this exchange will be of fashion swag at luxury product parties."

But shifting strategies and inconsistencies have frustrated investors, including a mortgage misstep that saw CIBC go from leader to laggard in two years.CIBC is the only major Canadian bank to see its mortgage book shrink this year — something that’s particularly problematic given that home loans are it’s biggest consumer product.“Candidly, I think we went too far left in slowing things down, put the brakes on too hard,” Dodig, 54, told investors at a banking conference in September. “We’re readjusting for that.”The bank lags behind peers on many financial measures: CIBC is the only Canadian bank to see profit shrink so far this year, with a 2.2 per cent decline. Revenue growth is less than half that of its bigger rivals. Profit at its biggest and most important division, Canadian personal and small-business banking, is down 10 per cent. Return on equity, a profitability measure, has been falling since 2016.Dodig will be under pressure to show improvement when the Toronto-based lender reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Dec. 5.CIBC shares have underperformed the 22 per cent return of the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index since Dodig became CEO in September 2014, with its 8 per cent gain trailing all of Canada’s Big Six lenders except Bank of Nova Scotia.The bank’s shares trade at a discount despite CIBC’s “de-risking” efforts because of management’s inability to communicate its changing strategies to investors, according to Barclays Plc bank analyst John Aiken.“People are scratching their heads, trying to figure out exactly where things are heading,” Aiken said in an interview. “Concern has shifted away from risk into strategy, growth and outlook — and CIBC is still viewed as the bank with more issues from an investment standpoint.”In his early days, Dodig looked to be on the right track. He achieved his initial goals of accelerating earnings growth to 5 per cent to 10 per cent between 2016 and 2018, and achieving $4.9 billion of annual profit at the end of that period. But 2019 has been challenging and CIBC’s drive to continue increasing earnings is under threat, with Dodig warning investors in May to expect “relatively flat” growth this fiscal year.“There’s no question we haven’t achieved the same level of performance in the first three quarters of 2019,” Dodig said in an email. “While it’s tempting to change course when things get tough, we must take a long-term view of our strategy and focus on creating long-term value.”CIBC’s mixed messages on mortgages and acquisitions are examples of issues that have confused investors, said Steve Belisle, a senior portfolio manager with Manulife Investment Management.“It feels like management can’t really have a strategy and stick to it,” said Belisle, who holds CIBC along with other Canadian banks. “They keep changing what they’re saying and keep changing what they’re doing, depending on what they think their stock price will benefit from.”The US$5-billion takeover of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp in June 2017 — CIBC’s largest acquisition in its 152-year history, and a move designed to counter investor concerns that the bank is too Canadian — was criticized by those expecting a smaller deal.When Dodig took over in 2014, he earmarked as much as $2 billion (US$1.8 billion) for U.S. wealth-management deals. Within two years, that swelled to a $4-billion budget for deals that could include private banking or a commercial lender. PrivateBancorp exceeded that, though CIBC was hurt by bad timing: Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory drove bank stock prices up, forcing CIBC to increase its initial US$3.8-billion offer to win over PrivateBancorp investors.“We needed capabilities on both sides of the border to grow key client relationships, and we’re pleased the acquisition became accretive well ahead of schedule,” Dodig said in an emailed statement. “I would do this deal again any day.”CIBC’s U.S. push comes years after bigger rivals Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal made substantial forays south of the border and reaped rewards from the American exposure, giving them rising profits and diversification beyond their home turf.Dodig has made other changes to recast CIBC. He pursued small deals to build up its U.S. capital-markets operation and sold some businesses. This month, CIBC agreed to pare ownership in CIBC FirstCaribbean by selling a 67 per cent stake, though at a reduced value from its earlier investment. He’s moving the bank to new headquarters after a century at Toronto’s financial district, leasing as much as 1.75 million square feet at a nearby complex under construction called CIBC Square.Dodig’s challenge is convincing investors he’s moving in the right direction.“We recognize there have been cases where we could have more clearly communicated with investors and we’ll take that feedback and act on it — because we have the right strategy and we need to ensure it is consistently articulated and well understood,” Dodig said.Ironically, the bank’s poor share performance — CIBC has become the cheapest Canadian bank stock based on price-to-earnings ratio — may make the stock more attractive.“Everybody has noticed the underperformance and CIBC now has a smaller valuation than National Bank, and that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Baskin’s Schwartz said, adding that he’s thinking about buying shares. “This could be the one to break out. It’s definitely on our radar screen.”Bloomberg.com"
8,Bloomberg News,,Branson ready for his biggest test yet as space shot beckons,"Richard Branson plucks a dried grasshopper from a jar, takes a bite, and pronounces the insect surprisingly tasty before slurping down a vegan yogurt and offering to trial the concoction on Virgin Atlantic Airways flights.",0,,0,,10/28/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/branson-ready-for-his-biggest-test-yet-as-space-shot-beckons-1.1338477,,"Richard Branson plucks a dried grasshopper from a jar, takes a bite, and pronounces the insect surprisingly tasty before slurping down a vegan yogurt and offering to trial the concoction on Virgin Atlantic Airways flights. 
 The U.K. billionaire, a serial creator of companies spanning record labels to airlines to fizzy drinks and bridal gowns, is in his element. He’s meeting with fellow entrepreneurs at a so-called “Pitch to Rich” session in Israel, where the contest’s winner gets a business-class flight to London for a week of hot-housing at Virgin’s own innovation hub. 
 The event in Tel Aviv speaks to the appetite for fresh ideas that still drives Britain’s best-known businessman in his seventieth year. Branson’s own contribution to human endeavour is about to enter a critical phase as Virgin Galactic, the prime focus of his attention for 15 years, prepares to launch the first tourists into space next year. 
 Travelling straight from Israel to the U.S., Branson will ring the opening bell in the New York Stock Exchange on Monday as Virgin Galactic becomes the first space-launch company to go public. 
 On a trip marking Virgin Atlantic’s arrival in the Israeli market, the Englishman said he’s trying to quell his mounting anticipation about the upcoming space voyage given previous delays, including a hiatus following a crash that killed two test pilots in 2014. Branson has pledged to personally be aboard the first public space shot. 
 “Virgin Galactic has been a difficult baby and it’s gone through some tough teenage years, but we’re now close to creating something very special,” he said. “There need to be more test flights this year and I’m trying not to get too carried away until a few months before the launch, but I’m very excited.” 
 FIRED UP 
 The spaceflight is just one of a series of planned milestones in a 12-month period that’s set to define the Virgin Group’s future. With his iconoclast approach intact even after five decades in the business of disruption, Branson also has big plans for his airline, a satellite launcher and a cruise-ship business he plans to introduce next year, among other projects. 
 Boeing Co.’s future-technologies arm has pledged US$20 million for a minority stake in Virgin Galactic, a business finding itself in increasingly hot competition for billionaire-funded space travel. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin company plans to take payloads and tourists to the edge of space on an 11-minute flight, while Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX has also joined the race with a pledge in to send passengers to the moon, Mars and beyond. 
 Rather than an IPO, Virgin Galactic is listing through a merger with a publicly traded investment vehicle, Social Capital Hedosophia. Its shares rose 11% Friday after the combination was completed. The new entity will be known as Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and trade under the ticker SPCE. 
 Galactic is interested in developing hypersonic airline flights that would slash global travel times. While the dream of linking London with Australia in just a few hours remains distant, its technology could be more readily adapted to link far-flung U.S. cities, Branson predicts. 
 Branson speaks in glowing terms of 35-year-old Virgin Atlantic, the airline that took the brand from a quirky U.K. record label known for signing the Sex Pistols to a globally recognized force. 
 INDIAN PLANS 
 Among Branson’s travel frontiers is India, where he will seek to crack the burgeoning travel market with a service to Mumbai that kicks off this month. A route to Sao Paulo will follow next year as the carrier steps up competition with arch-rival British Airways, emboldened by a partnership with Delta Air Lines Inc. 
 In Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has an ally with shoulders broad enough to take on British Airways after years of often bitter competition -- and courtroom clashes -- with the larger carrier. That push could gain traction with an increase in flights following the opening next decade of a new runway at London’s Heathrow airport. Branson says he’s been buoyed by the hub’s positive reaction to his calls for a shakeup to the slot-allocation systems to allow his airline to become a second U.K. flag carrier. 
 He admits to a sadness surrounding the imminent reduction of his majority stake in Virgin Atlantic to a 20-per-cent holding, saying he’s taking the step reluctantly to safeguard the carrier’s future in an industry increasingly dominated by a handful of airline groups linked by cross-shareholdings and cost and revenue sharing 
 “It’s not a deal that I particularly like doing because from talking to the staff they’d quite like the airline to remain slightly more personal,” he says. “But I’ve promised them I’m going to remain very involved.” 
 Next year will also see the launch of the new Virgin Voyages cruise line, with the first ship commencing sea trials in the Mediterranean before being based in Miami, with three more to follow. Branson is pitching the business at people who would normally hate such a holiday -- “like me,” he says -- and has asked managers to submit their own list of bugbears, headed by his own dislike of buffet dining, which he plans to eliminate. 
 Also in the pipeline are Virgin Orbit’s first full “drop and fire” launch from the wing of a modified Boeing 747 in January as the satellite-deployment startup heads toward its commercial debut. 
 PASSENGER PODS 
 Then there’s the opening of Virgin Hotels in four U.S. cities that will more than double the size of a business founded as a bet on real estate after the 2008 crash, followed by the construction of Virgin Hyperloop One’s link between Mumbai and Pune, marking the world debut of technology that shoots passenger pods through a tube at near-supersonic speeds. 
 Back in Tel Aviv, Branson regales his audience of Israeli startups with tales of how he became a one-man promotional campaign for the Virgin brand. They’re familiar stories for many — death-defying stunts in hot-air balloons and yachts, getting arrested at Heathrow after painting a Virgin logo on the tail of a BA Concorde, crushing Coca-Cola cans in a Sherman tank in Times Square to promote Virgin Cola — but told with a renewed energy. 
 One thing seems certain: The man with the broad smile and surfer-dude wavy mane isn’t about to step back from the fray. 
 “I enjoy every minute of my life and the variety of what we do,” he says. “True, I sometimes glance in the mirror and wonder who the hell that is looking back. But I don’t feel any older and I want carry on and use the experience that I have.”"

Cronos Group Inc.’s estimates range from a loss of $1.40 to a profit of $2.14.By comparison, the average spread for consumer staples is 27 cents and the average spread for energy is 79 cents.It’s an indication of how difficult it is to get a handle on the outlook for an emerging sector when there’s still plenty of uncertainty about what the future holds, said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments Inc. and manager of the Purpose Marijuana Opportunities Fund.“A lot of these companies rushed out to become public and are really learning on the fly about how to do a lot of things, and one of those is how to handle expectations,” Taylor said. “When you’re an analyst it’s hard to have a ton of confidence in guidance, or you might not be getting any guidance at all.”That uncertainty has taken a toll on valuations. Pot stocks have lost more than half their value since their highs earlier this year, with the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF down about 53 per cent since March 19.Hexo Corp., for example, recently cut its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance to a range of $14.5 million to $16.5 million after previously saying it would double from the third-quarter level of $13 million. It also withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance for $400 million in sales and announced Thursday it would cut about 200 of its 822 staff members.Analysts who cover Hexo have steadily cut their average earnings per share outlook for the current year, from a loss of 7.6 cents in January to a loss of 21 cents today.“This is a sector that’s relatively new and a lot of the analysts who have been bullish over the last year have been burned already,” Taylor said. “That’s why you’re getting a wider range — you might get a few who are still newer to the names and want to take a risk, but most have been so disappointed with the recent performance that they’ve put lower expectations in their models.”Bloomberg.com"
12,Bloomberg News,"Sarah Ponczek, Vildana Hajric and Molly Smith","Actually, the stock market has barely moved in the two years under Trump","It’s like a gravitational field the S&P 500 can’t get free from, the place to which all rallies must return. And it was back in force Wednesday, eliciting angry notice from President Donald Trump as waves of selling dragged the benchmark within points of where it stood 21 months ago.",-1,,-1,,10/2/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/actually-the-stock-market-has-barely-moved-in-the-two-years-under-trump-1.1325589,,"It’s like a gravitational field the S&P 500 can’t get free from, the place to which all rallies must return. And it was back in force Wednesday, eliciting angry notice from President Donald Trump as waves of selling dragged the benchmark within points of where it stood 21 months ago. 
 As has repeatedly happened in U.S. stocks, a few days of losses just undid weeks and months of progress, depositing the S&P 500 at an all-too-familiar level. Frustrated traders were left to lament that it has taken the better part of two years for the index to advance all of 15 points. 
 “I’m looking at this thing and my god, it’s like a Tour de France kind of bike ride,” Marvin Loh, global macro strategist at State Street, said by phone. “Massive climbs and great descents -- except these are horrible descents. And then we climb up to the next peak and then we get to ride it down.” 
 Trump loves touting equity gains more than his predecessors, who were usually wary of taking credit for unpredictable returns largely out of anyone’s control. And while the president’s record remains a solid one by historical standards, with the S&P 500 up almost 43 per cent including dividends since his election victory, on a price basis it’s the same return he could’ve claimed in January 2018. Amid uneven economic data and a two-year trade war, the market hasn’t budged since. 
 For investors watching day-to-day swings, two years of inertia have been anything but boring. February 2018’s convulsions in volatility markets were followed eight months later by the bull market’s nearest-to-death experience in seven years. The Federal Reserve has done a complete 180, cutting interest rates twice after a series of hikes. Now deteriorating economic data, including the worst manufacturing report in a decade, is reviving recession fears. 
 The president doesn’t see it that way. In another torrent of tweets Wednesday morning, he said Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is the reason stocks are falling. A day earlier, he blamed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after equities got rocked by a weak factory report. 
 
 Politics aside, a more pressing concern for investors this week has been economic data that hints of a recession. Carmakers sank Wednesday after quarterly sales reports from Ford and General Motors added to concern over thinning profit margins in the industry. Ten of 11 S&P 500 sectors fell at least one per cent after a private payrolls report showed slowing growth one day after the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index slipped to 47.8 in September, the lowest level since 2009. 
 Of course, recession fear is nothing new, and as high as anxiety levels have occasionally gotten among investors, it’s been matched by the market’s resilience. After a vicious August in which the S&P 500 plunged more than 2.5 per cent three separate times and rallied one per cent or more seven, the index vaulted within points of a record in September. 
 As things stand now, it’s been 614 days since the S&P 500 surged to a high of 2,872 in January 2018. In that period, the benchmark has hit 18 fresh records, suffered through a correction, a near 20 per cent loss, and two more declines of 6% this year. After Wednesday capped the first back-to-back declines of one per cent this year, the index is roughly where it stood after Trump’s tax overhaul sent stocks soaring. 
 But what tax cuts gave by way of optimistic forecasts, Trump’s trade war has taken away. Persistent uncertainty has led companies to cut back on investment spending, while confidence has faltered. 
 “Ultimately, it’s all Trump, because you can blame trade and tariffs on Trump,” said Susan Schmidt, head of U.S. equities at Aviva Investors. “It’s noise that’s cascading out of actions from the administration. We have stalled out because we need another tailwind and nothing is there. If anything, the headwinds are keeping the market from moving up.” 
 But while equity markets have stood still, bond yields have plunged. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields stand more than 100 basis points lower than where they were when the S&P 500 hit a record in January 2018. That’s pushed equity investors into so-called bond proxies, with utilities and real estate stocks each up more than 20% in the same 21-month period that the S&P 500 has gone nowhere. 
 To Andrew Lapthorne, global head of quantitative strategy at Societe Generale, the move is ill-advised, as investors are lulled into a false sense of safety. 
 “Many argue that low bond yields justify higher stock valuations, but in a bear market ALL stocks tend to lose money,” Lapthorne wrote in a note to clients this week. “Investors are playing a game of chicken: hoping lower bond yields do not lead to a recession, but equally that the global economy remains sufficiently moribund to not cause bond yields to rise.” 
 Kim Forrest, the chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Management in Pittsburgh, agrees, and says it’s encouraging that stocks have been stagnant. Amid trade concerns, impeachment proceedings and slowing growth, it’s quite a feat that the S&P 500 is still up 15 per cent year-to-date, she says. It could be worse, but that doesn’t mean investors should run for cover. 
 “What the hell is wrong with investors that they actually say, ‘I’m going into cash or I’m buying all utilities?’ You think that’s going to save you? It’s like the ocean going up and down and you’re trying to somehow make that not happen. It’s crazy,” Forrest said by phone. “If you’re an investor, the funds that are in the market should be around for some time period out in the future, not for immediate use today. This isn’t a bank account.”

There hadn’t been a non-prime RMBS since Xceed Mortgage Trust in March 2007.Home Capital is turning to the securitization market at a time when it doesn’t have any senior unsecured bonds outstanding, said Kotush. The company, which came close to collapse in 2017, is focused on re-gaining its investment grade rating, he said. Home Trust is rated BB+ by S&P Global while Home Capital is rated BB-, both below investment grade.The alternative lender was bailed out by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. after it was found by regulators to have improperly disclosed falsified home-loan applications and short-sellers targeted the stock. Berkshire has since cashed in as the stock has recovered, with its stake falling to about 4.7 per cent from 20 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The shares closed up 3.4 per cent at $25.15 in Toronto, bringing gains to 75 per cent this year and making it the best-performing stock in the S&P/TSX Composite Financials Index.Home Capital priced the top rated securities with an expected average life of 2.38 years with a spread of 145 basis points over Canadian treasury bonds, Bloomberg data show. Equitable Bank, a lender rated at second-lowest investment grade priced three-year senior unsecured deposit notes on Monday at the same spread, according to people familiar with the matter.Bloomberg.com"

He now expects more new highs for the benchmark but added that things could get choppy.Candice Bangsund, portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, urged investors in mid-August to “resist the temptation to panic and recommend staying invested at this time.” She’s continuing that theme, though “periodic bouts of volatility are surely to prevail.” Longer term fundamentals for the global economy remain largely intact and Canadian stocks should outperform due to the bias toward larger value-oriented sectors of the market such as financials and banks and resources, which should catch up.Eight Capital’s technical research analyst Tina Normann had said that a more attractive entry point would present itself for investors in mid-September.“Investor sentiment had become overly negative even though growth numbers are still good,” said Hans Albrecht, fund manager at Toronto-based Horizons ETFs Management Canada Inc. “It could be a resumption of more of what we’ve seen earlier in the year.”Like Belski, Horizons’ Albrecht doesn’t expect the stock rally to be smooth. “I wouldn’t discount a bit more volatility over the next month or so,” he said.October has been somewhat of a volatile month and that could play out this year with trade talks expected, the Bank of Canada’s set to make a decision on interest rates (will they or won’t they cut?) and elections. Polls showing that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are locked in a tight race with the opposition ahead of the vote next month may have investors on edge.“Although politics rarely plays a meaningful role in equity performance, we found there is some evidence to suggest minority governments can be positive for markets, particularly when the valuation starting point is low, as it is currently,” said BMO’s Belski in an a Sept. 12 report.“At the same time, it’s a low yield world again and equities is one of the places we can be,” Albrecht said.Bloomberg.com"

China was trying to fill a protein gap left by African swine fever at a time U.S. suppliers were caught up in a trade war between Washington and Beijing, and Canada was a preferred market.The boom wasn’t being felt to the same extent by producers given Canadian pork prices are tied to the U.S. hog market.“But now the shoe’s on the other foot,” Kevin Grier, a livestock market analyst in Guelph, Ontario, said by telephone. “Now our producers are tied to the U.S. and they’re better off than they would be if they were priced with the packers.”Maple Leaf didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.There are still markets for Canadian pork. China has increased purchases from other countries, and Canada has started back-filling demand. While they can still sell the meat, processors aren’t receiving a premium on those sales.For Canadian beef, China is a small market at 7.7 per cent of exports. With China out of the picture, the industry has been able to easily reroute to other countries.There is still no clarity on when the halt will be lifted, although the Canadian government has expressed optimism it will be able to restore exports before an investigation into the forged certificates is complete.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency “has provided detailed information to Chinese officials on the measures we have taken to address their concerns,” Marie-Claude Bibeau, minister for agriculture and agri-food, said in an emailed statement. “We are waiting for a response from Customs China before resuming export certificates for pork and beef destined for China.”Bloomberg.com"

That doesn't mean his views are any less clear","Commentary: Judging by the record haul of cash he's hoarding, it's safe to assume he doesn't expect the market to remain elevated forever",-1,,-1,,8/26/2019,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/in-this-elevated-market-warren-buffett-is-missing-from-the-chatter-that-doesnt-mean-his-views-are-any-less-clear,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/berk5555.jpg,"“This time is different,” the rally cry of investors who spot an irrevocably changed market every few years, is in ample supply these days. Interest rates have reached a permanent low. U.S. stocks have reached a permanent high. FAANG stocks will rule markets for all time. Value investing is dead.During previous bouts, Warren Buffett, America’s patron saint of investing offered his sage — and inevitably unpopular — perspective. When the dot-com mania raged in the late 1990s, he famously warned against chasing internet stocks. And during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he implored investors not to give up on U.S. stocks. Of course, neither episode turned out to be different from the innumerable ones that preceded it, at least when it comes to investing.This time, Buffett has been uncharacteristically missing from the chatter, but that doesn’t mean his views are any less clear, or any less worth paying attention to.Let’s start with Buffett’s favourite stock market barometer, the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. As its name suggests, it measures the total value of the stock market as a percentage of GDP. In simple terms, a lower ratio is bullish and a higher one is bearish.The ratio was prescient during the last two downturns. It shot up to 146 per cent at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, a record at the time and well above its average of 89 per cent since 1975, according to numbers compiled by the World Bank. It peaked again at 137 per cent just before the financial crisis in 2007. Where is the market cap-to-GDP ratio now? It notched a fresh high of 154 per cent in 2017, according to the latest available number, and is almost certainly higher today given that the U.S. stock market is up roughly 7 per cent since the end of 2017.So it’s probably safe to say that Buffett doesn’t love the lofty level of the stock market. And judging by the record US$122 billion of cash he’s hoarding at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it’s also safe to assume he doesn’t expect the market to remain elevated forever. Buffett’s cash pile is more than half the value of Berkshire’s US$208-billion portfolio of public companies, and since 1987 his cash allocation as a percentage of Berkshire’s portfolio was only higher in the years leading up to the financial crisis.At the same time, the few stocks that do appeal to Buffett suggest his faith in value investing is unshaken despite a miserable decade of underperformance for the strategy. Roughly 45 per cent of Berkshire’s stock portfolio is allocated to the financial sector, and eight of the portfolio’s top 12 holdings are financial stocks — a deeply contrarian bet. The sector has been hampered for much of the last decade by tighter regulation and low interest rates. While profits have picked up recently, many investors fear that a prolonged period of low rates will keep a lid on profits for the foreseeable future.As a result, the financial sector has been one of the cheapest sectors by most measures for years. It’s still the most represented sector in many value indexes, including a 21 per cent allocation in the S&P 500 Value Index and 23 per cent in the Russell 1000 Value Index. That’s apparently not enough for Buffett, whose allocation to the sector is double that.Much has been made of Buffett’s uncharacteristic pivot to technology stocks in recent years, but that, too, is mostly a value play. Apple Inc. makes up nearly 90 per cent of Berkshire’s 27 per cent allocation to the technology sector. When Buffett began buying Apple in early 2016, it was a bona fide value stock. It boasted an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, and an average price-to-cash flow ratio of 7.5 during the first quarter of that year, well below the S&P 500’s P/E ratio of 19.5 and P/CF ratio of 10.9. Apple is pricier today, but it’s still the largest name in the S&P 500 Value Index, with a hefty 8.3 per cent allocation.Buffett has said that he regrets passing on Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. when the companies were younger, but don’t mistake the maestro. The fact that he isn’t loading up on them today, despite having plenty of cash to do so, speaks volumes. Amazon trades at a jaw-dropping P/E ratio of 73 and Alphabet at 27, which is the furthest thing from value. Buffett already has a small 0.5 per cent allocation to Amazon on the recommendation of one of his deputies. Don’t count on him making meaningfully more room for Amazon or Google at current prices.For now, Buffett is paying a price for his dissent.  Berkshire’s return trailed the S&P 500 by 0.9 percentage points a year from 2009 to 2018, including dividends. It’s not the first time. Buffett lagged the market by 3.2 percentage points a year around the Nifty Fifty craze from 1971 to 1975 and by 6.1 percentage points a year during the dot-com boom from 1995 to 1999.Still, Berkshire’s portfolio remains unabashedly Buffett: big profits at a reasonable cost. The portfolio has a weighted-average return on capital of 12 per cent, compared with just 7.9 per cent for the S&P 500. And it’s far cheaper. Buffett’s portfolio has a P/E ratio of 16.5, based on 12-month trailing operating earnings per share, compared with 21 for the S&P 500.There’s little indication, in other words, that Buffett is wavering from his long-standing investing principles. It’s a timely example, even if Buffett is no longer eager to say so.Bloomberg.com"

Treasuries surged.Futures indicated losses of more than 2% in Japan. The S&P 500 Index tumbled almost 3% on Wednesday as the 10-year Treasury rate slid below the two-year for the first time since 2007. The 30-year yield fell to the lowest on record. Bonds also climbed across Europe, with the U.K. yield curve inverting for the first time since the financial crisis and Bund yields sliding to a fresh record low. Gold surged and crude oil slumped.Warnings flashing in bond markets are spooking investors who are already seeking shelter from the fraught geopolitical climate and the impact of the global trade war. While curve inversions normally precede economic downturns, they do not necessarily signal an imminent collapse in growth. The Federal Reserve will likely be powerless to keep the U.S. economy from falling into a recession and the 10-year yield could sink to zero by 2021, said JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jan Loeys.“You no longer have anything anchoring markets, you no longer have the Fed’s ability to repress financial volatility,” Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz Chief Economic Advisor & Bloomberg Opinion columnist, told Bloomberg TV. “The answer is more pro-growth policies to lift structural impediments and unfortunately that’s unlikely to materialize. That’s the big concern looking forward.”Meantime, European shares lost more than 1.5% after Germany’s economy contracted in the second quarter, adding to angst fueled by weak Chinese retail and industrial numbers.Here are the main moves in markets:The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800.49 points, or 3.05 per cent, to 25,479.42, the S&P 500 lost 85.72 points, or 2.93 per cent, to 2,840.6, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 242.42 points, or 3.02 per cent, to 7,773.94.

The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has also increased demand for haven assets, with traders and analysts in Bloomberg’s weekly survey near-unanimous on the bullish outlook for gold.Spot gold gained 0.2 per cent to US$1,503.20 an ounce at 11:51 a.m. in London. The metal has risen 4.3 per cent this week, which would be the largest increase since April 2016. Spot silver rose 0.5 per cent to US$17.0122 an ounce.

European shares fell with U.S. equity futures, while Asian stocks were mixed as positive sentiment from a strong day on Wall Street was offset by resurfacing trade tensions.Investors are continuing to flood into exchange-traded funds backed by gold, with holdings rising for a ninth day Thursday to the highest since March 2013.

It involves opening stores and staffing them with thousands of style advisers.The plan is working, and Aritzia’s six straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth show how new players are flooding into the openings in the apparel market as brands like Guess? Inc. and Gap Inc. stumble.Sales are particularly strong in the U.S. — where about a third of Aritzia’s 92 boutiques are located. The chain has a store at Manhattan’s new mall, Hudson Yards, that’s performing well, and is opening others this fiscal year in Denver, Minneapolis, Houston, Austin and East Rutherford, New Jersey.“Our business there is fantastic — both online and in our stores,” said chief executive Brian Hill, referring to the U.S. He spoke in an interview in Aritzia’s headquarters at a converted cannery overlooking Vancouver’s port.Aritzia, which has a market capitalization of $2.2 billion, is also an example of how physical stores can drive web traffic — and vice versa. Hill said the brick-and-mortar locations are bringing in new customers, leading to higher online sales and higher volumes.The company has positioned itself as an aspirational, “everyday luxury” brand — the more affordable end of the Duchess of Sussex’s closet. Its bright, airy stores are adorned with original artwork, custom furniture and staffed with sales associates to provide personalized advice. The locations are luring in shoppers while other apparel companies are paring back due to falling foot traffic.Investors aren’t so enthusiastic, however, with the company’s Canadian shares rising only 7 per cent this year — less than half the benchmark S&P/TSX’s advance. The current price of $17.51 isn’t far off the $16 price set in Aritzia’s 2016 initial public offering.The muted performance is due to the recent exit of a major private equity investor, Berkshire Partners LLC, said Amar Pandya, an associate portfolio manager at Vancouver-based PenderFund Capital Management, which owns Aritzia shares. Berkshire Partners had acquired a majority stake in 2005 and helped to fund expansion.The sale of a large stake “fed into the brick-and-mortar apocalypse backdrop, exacerbating those fears,” Pandya said.“We certainly took advantage of that drop,” he added. “They’re at the very early innings of the U.S. expansion — based on what we’ve seen over the past couple of quarters, the acceleration in the performance from the U.S. should continue.”Analysts are bullish: Eight out of nine who cover the company recommend buying the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Aritzia is on excellent footing,” CIBC World Markets analyst Mark Petrie said in a July 12 note to clients, citing the new stores and their potential to boost e-commerce. CIBC expects the pace of store openings to accelerate.Hill said the company is targeting premium locations for the new stores.“We want the best real estate out there — that’s why we’re at Hudson Yards,” he said. “I was told a long time ago by my father: Make sure you get the best real estate. Because then if it doesn’t work, you know it’s you.”Hill is the third generation of his family to find a career in retail. His family owns the Hills of Kerrisdale department store — a Vancouver institution — and his grandfather was an executive at Hudson’s Bay Co.Aritizia is also interested in China, and Hill said the company will arrive there “at some point in the future.” By 2021, China may surpass the U.S. as the world’s biggest retail market, researcher eMarketer Inc. forecast last month.Meanwhile, he’s undaunted by a U.S. market that’s been labeled as “over-retailed.” Dozens of retailers have gone bankrupt in recent years and store closures have outpaced store openings, according to a McKinsey & Co. report in January.“Our growth is at such a high trajectory in the U.S. that we will continue to focus there,” he said. “We just have so much opportunity.” Bloomberg.com"

He argues lower interest rates, an accelerating housing market, a solid labour market, record high stocks and overall decent investment returns will support consumption.“We’re probably going to see a pick up in big ticket items again,” Demers said in a phone interview. “It’s not great because we’re relying on debt, but in terms of dynamics, it looks more positive over the next 12 to 18 months in an environment where rates are going down, and not up.”Home sales skidded to their lowest since 2012 last year as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market. Automobile sales also suffered in Canada, with 2018 marking the first annual drop since the last recession. The malaise has been reflected in the pace of household credit growth, which has slowed to a crawl: It rose just 3.4 per cent in May, the weakest annual pace since 1983.But the Canadian housing market — east of Manitoba, at least — is already showing signs of shaking off that weakness. Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show prices through June in the Greater Toronto Area are 3 per cent higher on a six-month average basis, while Ottawa and Montreal have seen even faster gains, up 7.6 per cent and and 6.4 per cent respectively. In addition, the 11.5 per cent increase in resale volumes in the GTA signals “very strong,” demand, Demers said.“The soft landing is behind us,” he added. “When you think about the GTA and Canada in general, we’re looking more at a re-acceleration.”The high household debt level “remains a big concern and a headwind to the Canadian dollar,” said Demers, and without a strong capital spending boom, the lingering debt burden will mean it’s tough to “outperform trend growth” once rates eventually move higher, constraining disposable income.In the shorter term, however, Demers is more bullish on Canada, partly because the country’s equity market may be less exposed to trade-war uncertainty. He sees car sales stabilizing this summer, and the housing market in central Canada continuing to accelerate. Gross domestic product for May on Wednesday will give an indication of whether the country’s economic upswing remains on track.“The pace of credit growth should pick up in the second half of this year,” as more “trend-like” household spending returns, Demers said. “This removes a lot of the downside risks regarding households we saw earlier this year.”Consumer confidence highest in a year and a halfOne more reason to believe big-ticket spending is set for a rebound is the recent surge in consumer confidence measures, which are closely tied to the state of the economy and moves in stock markets. The Bloomberg Nanos economic mood index reached 59.06 this month, the highest level in a year and a half. Periods of elevated consumer confidence tend to coincide with increases in home and vehicle sales.The fear of missing out is also fuelling the nation’s debt habit.40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they're spending more than they earnA survey by Manulife Bank of Canada found almost 40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they’re spending more than they earn, and 12 per cent attribute the imbalance to an excess of costly outings with friends or family.A lot of that has to do with the pressure of social media, according to Rick Lunny, the bank’s chief executive officer, who says especially for younger people who haven’t had time to build savings, the rising cost of housing and child care leaves little to spend on entertainment.“Everybody’s on social media,” Lunny said by phone. “Everybody seems to have a better life than you. So you have this fear of missing out and you only live once attitude, but that’s a very expensive lifestyle when you can’t afford it.”Bloomberg.com"

Its shares have more than doubled this year, making it one of the top-performing health-care stocks on the TSX Venture Exchange.Li’s other healthcare forays include a cancer-drug developer and a company holding the patent for a chemical that purportedly defies aging. His Canadian bet is a decidedly more pragmatic affair.Our health care system is cumbersome and imposes agonizingly long wait times on patients, largely because it’s one of the least digitized systems among developed economies, says Hamed Shahbazi, Well Health’s chief executive officer and founder.Shahbazi describes Well Health as “the WeWork for doctors” — bringing them software tools they couldn’t otherwise afford as standalone clinics. That makes their practices more efficient, meaning better outcomes and shorter waits for patients, he says. Doctors can join Well Health’s growing chain of clinics under a revenue-sharing agreement or simply pay for the services of the company’s medical electronic records software.There’s plenty of room for improvement. Canada’s primary-care doctors, who can see as many as 50 patients a day, have been sluggish to adopt the most basic technologies. Walls of paper folders are still the norm, online patient portals are almost unheard of, and people still while away hours in waiting rooms.Canada scored the worst out of 11 high-income nations in terms of wait times for emergency-room care, specialists and elective surgery in a 2017 study by the Commonwealth Fund. Compared to universal healthcare systems in other developed economies, Canada is one of the most expensive, with modest to poor performance — in part due to its lower-than-average adoption of medical technologies, according to the Fraser Institute.We're one of the most broadband-connected countries in the world — it seems totally counterintuitive that we lack any kind of digitization in primary care“Which industry do you know still operates like it did 40 years ago?,” asks Shahbazi. “We’re one of the most broadband-connected countries in the world — it seems totally counterintuitive that we lack any kind of digitization in primary care.”It’s a lucrative market: Canada is estimated to have spent $254 billion, or $6,839 per person, in 2018 on healthcare, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information. It’s also “an attractive, recession-resilient business,” says Gabriel Leung, a Toronto-based analyst at Beacon Securities Ltd.Well Health is now Canada’s third-largest provider of electronic medical records following a string of acquisitions, servicing more than 850 clinics, according to Daniel Rosenberg, an analyst at Haywood Securities Inc., who believes the company’s shares are undervalued. All four analysts have “buy” recommendations on the stock.Shahbazi is a familiar name in Canadian tech circles for his sale of a bill payment processor to PayPal for $304 million in 2017. Well Health, he believes, has “many, many-fold greater potential,” largely because the field is wide open: the country’s largest chain of health-care clinics has only 34 offices, he says.He says he captured the interest of Li thanks to an acquaintance with a long-time confidante of the billionaire, Solina Chau.Chau runs Horizon Ventures, Li’s prodigious venture capital arm that was an early backer of Facebook Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Siri and is the primary channel of investment for the billionaire’s wealth. In the past 14 months, Horizon Ventures has participated in at least two rounds of funding in Well Health, while Li bought $500,000 in convertible bonds through a holding company in June, according to company filings.Li owned 11 per cent of outstanding shares, making him the second-biggest investor after Shahbazi, according to a May filing. Chau didn’t respond to a request seeking comment.Well Health traded at 96¢ Wednesday in Toronto, for a market value of $93.5 million.Longer term, Well Health plans more ambitious technological rollouts, such as telemedicine. While only about two per cent of cases here are conducted remotely at present, about 60 per cent of primary care visits could be done just as easily over an iPhone, according to Shahbazi.“A clear, irrefutable trend across the world is that there’s a growing number of patients for a not-growing-fast-enough number of physicians,” says Shahbazi. “So in an environment where not everyone’s going to have a family doctor to provide long-term care, the equalizer is technology.”Bloomberg.com"

A broad outline of the Trump-Xi agenda was discussed in a phone call Monday between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and his counterpart in Beijing, Vice Premier Liu He.In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed optimism that a deal could be reached by year end, saying the two sides “were about 90 per cent of the way there and I think there’s a path to complete this,” with a need still for “the right efforts.”U.S. stock futures jumped on his remarks.“The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship,” Mnuchin said.People familiar with the American readout of the Lighthizer-Liu conversation characterized the call as productive. They said both sides discussed how they can present the resumption of trade talks to their domestic audiences as a win.The U.S. won’t accept any further conditions on tariffs as part of reopening negotiations and no detailed trade deal is expected from the leaders’ summit, a senior U.S. administration official said Tuesday. The Trump administration has said the goal of the meeting is to create a path forward for a trade agreement, after negotiations broke down last month.Although each side still wants to secure significant concessions from the other, both agreed to dial down the tit-for-tat responses and aim for a truce that could soothe financial markets while their sides resume negotiations, people familiar with the situation said. It’s not clear if they would set a definite timetable for the tariff cease-fire.The U.S. is prepared to delay the new tariffs for the moment because Beijing wouldn’t have agreed to the meeting otherwise, according to people familiar with the matter.China is willing to make minor compromises including removing the threat of restricting rare-earth exports to the U.S., people familiar with the matter said.The talks between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies mark a critical juncture in their nearly year-old trade war, and both sides have plenty to lose if it escalates. Trump is riding a strong economy and booming stock market into his re-election campaign. China’s economy has been slowing, and U.S. tariffs are encouraging some foreign companies to shift production or plan investment elsewhere to avoid the higher costs.People familiar with the talks say some advisers are pushing Trump to avoid setting a hard deadline at the G20, to avoid a situation similar to when the two leaders met in December and agreed to a 90-day tariff pause. Lighthizer and other advisers, at that point, said it was a fixed tariff-suspension period to allow time for more talks, but the deadline was repeatedly extended. When those negotiations broke down last month, Trump followed through on this threat to raise tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 per cent from 10 per cent.The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the trade chiefs exchanged views on trade and economic issues during their phone call Monday. USTR didn’t respond to a request for comment on the discussions between Lighthizer and Liu.Bloomberg.com"

 Trump officially starts his 2020 campaign on Tuesday with a rally in Orlando, Florida, and appears to be road-testing some of the themes he’ll be touching on in the next 18 months, including stoking fear of a market meltdown. “Tuesday will be a Big Crowd and Big Day,” he said in another tweet. 
 The president has claimed several times this year and as recently as Friday in a “Fox & Friends” interview that the U.S. stock market would be 5,000 to 10,000 points higher if the Federal Reserve hadn’t raised interest rates four times in 2018. 
 He also tweeted in February that “had the opposition party” won in 2016, “the Stock Market would be down at least 10,000 points by now” -- an unprovable assertion. And in January Trump suggested that if “you want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump.” 
 Research by Macrotrends shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s performance so far in Trump’s term has been middling compared with his predecessors, and trails the gains made under Democrats Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. It’s a touch above the gains logged under Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush; George W. Bush had presided over a losing market at this point in his first term. 
 The benchmark S&P 500 index made a record high in early May before slipping in the face of Trump’s stepped-up trade war with China. The more narrow DJIA, whose performance Trump likes to reference, last peaked more than eight months ago, on Oct. 3.

Tech has juiced the bull market over the past decade, and a world without the sector’s undying strength is a grim one to picture.“If you’re worried about tech, and you can’t see any other leader coming through, then how can you be positive about U.S. equity markets as well?” says Shah, whose firm manages US$442 billion.Technology stocks have been indispensable to the equity market’s longest bull run ever. The sector is up more than 500 per cent since the 2009 bottom, and the group of six companies often associated with acronyms FAANG or FAAMG have accounted for roughly one fifth of the S&P 500’s rally. Now the market darlings have been hit with a one-two punch in the arenas of trade and regulation, throwing their role as market leaders into doubt.Semiconductor companies and tech hardware firms get a significant amount of their sales from China, pinpointing them as ground zero in the U.S.-China trade war. Plus, the move from the Trump administration to blacklist Huawei Technologies Co. has strategists across Wall Street describing the current environment as a tech war. Add in U.S. antitrust probes hovering over some of the tech mega-caps, and it’s a recipe for trouble.We don't expect there to be a recession, but we think there is a slowdown ahead“You have to be very, very brave to call the top for the tech sector,” said Shah, a senior global investment strategist. “The great times for technology are probably behind us now.”The S&P 500 technology sector fell 8.9 per cent in May, its worst month since 2008. While the group was up 0.9 per cent as of 11:55 a.m. in New York Wednesday, tech stocks are still roughly seven per cent from a record high set in April. So far this week, Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have both fallen more than five per cent in the face of regulatory concerns. While neither company actually classifies as an S&P 500 tech company, they’re often associated with the club.Not that there’s a blanket of doom and gloom over the entire sector. Some pockets, like software security companies, tend to be more stable and could continue to provide healthy returns, according to Shah. But overall, Principal Global Investors is advising clients to shift their equity holdings to a more defensive posture.Within sectors, Shah recommends utilities or real estate. Since the start of May, the two classic bond proxies are the only S&P 500 sectors in the green. Globally, she prefers U.S. stocks over emerging markets. While the American benchmark fell 6.6 per cent in May, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped 7.5 per cent. The idea is to keep risk exposure, but up the onus on quality just in case the bad news falls away, she said.“We don’t expect there to be a recession, but we think there is a slowdown ahead,” said Shah. “The best way to do it is you need to stay in risk, but be more defensively positioned for that slowdown.”Bloomberg.com"

I think economic reason will prevail and the two countries will work something out that’s to their mutual advantage.”Watsa, chief executive officer of Canadian insurer and holding company Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., is especially bullish on India and sees increased privatization in the economy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi just won a second term in elections, with his Bharatiya Janata Party winning a sweeping majority.“We created Fairfax India because of Mr. Modi getting elected the first time and we just think the next five years are going to be transformative,” Watsa, 68, said. “Over time, we’ll raise money in Fairfax India and over time, we’ll have many ways of putting more money into India. We think India will be the single best place to put money in the future.”Watsa said his companies have invested about $5 billion (US$3.7 billion) in India, including a stake in Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd. last year, the first time the Reserve Bank of India allowed a foreign firm to take a majority interest in a local lender. The bank is gearing up for a stock market listing, which could come as early as this year or 2020.“The government has told us they’d like an IPO before the end of this year, but we might be able to get an extension on that, and the extension might be six months or so,” Watsa said, adding that the Indian bank is poised to benefit from economic growth in the region.Despite global fears of increasing Hindu nationalism under Modi’s party, Watsa isn’t too bothered. “That’s a very small component of the BJP party and I think Mr. Modi has said clearly he’s all-inclusive, he’s focused on economic growth for everyone,” Watsa said.Watsa is also bullish on the U.S., citing many investment opportunities and effective economic policies, as well as in Greece, where Fairfax has a large stake in EuroBank Ergasias SA.“I particularly like Greece — it’s come through a very difficult time, it’s got an election coming,” he said. “If Greece follows business-friendly policies, that it well might, Greece will benefit greatly.”In Canada, Fairfax holds stakes in BlackBerry Ltd. and steelmaker Stelco Holdings Inc. and remains confident in both companies’ management, Watsa said. The firm also has a 40 per cent stake in TorStar Corp., the Canadian publishing conglomerate that’s fallen by half in the past 12-months to just 77 cents. Watsa’s taking a long-term view on the company.“TorStar hasn’t worked out yet,” he said. “We’re praying that over time, it’ll work. We take a long-term view. No plans to change stake.”Bloomberg.com"

The VIX Index jumped 43 per cent, the most since October — the start of a horrible quarter for U.S. equities. U.S. stocks opened sharply lower today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 344.33 points, or 1.30 per cent, at the open to 26,160.62. The S&P 500 opened lower by 36.75 points, or 1.25 per cent, at 2,908.89. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 182.15 points, or 2.23 per cent, to 7,981.85 at the opening bell. The TSX was down 131 points at 16,362.….of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed, but will be shortly, at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!Whether they were a negotiating tactic or a sign of something more ominous, Trump’s tweets jolted markets that had been lulled in recent weeks by signs of progress in trade talks, a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve and better-than-expected corporate earnings. Investors who had grown accustomed to cross-asset volatility at or near historically low levels were once again forced to consider that all might not be smooth sailing.Tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive, dive, dive“When the president puts his foot down, it makes the market go down,” Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, wrote in an email. “Tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive, dive, dive.”China reportedly was considering nixing the talks that were scheduled to resume Wednesday in Washington, though the Foreign Ministry said Monday afternoon that negotiators were indeed preparing to travel to the U.S. for the meetings. The ministry declined to provide details on the schedule, however.“Trade had been put to the side by many market participants,” Andrew Tilton, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “Market pricing assumed there would be some kind of a deal, and no further escalation in tariffs. And meanwhile the growth outlook was actually improving.” Now, “this raises the spectre of a significant hit to growth should these tariffs escalate and should the uncertainty associated with that weigh on investment going forward,” he said.“It might not be as bad as it looks” but it’s “very likely to undo all of the positive momentum we’ve seen,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney. The question is whether this is “a last-minute negotiation tactic” or will mark a breakdown in the talks, he said.Assets across the globe were swept up by the developments. The yuan plunged the most since 2016, catching options traders off guard. WTI crude fell more than 2 per cent, dropping to nearly US$60 a barrel. Soybeans fell, while gold rose. The moves came amid heavy volume, even though Japan, South Korea and the U.K. are closed for holidays. Chinese state-backed funds were active in selected stocks, according to people familiar with the matter, seeking to cushion the blow from the sudden escalation in trade tensions.“If current news flow is simply posturing and relations get smoothed over and a U.S.-China deal is ultimately reached (though probably over a longer time frame than previously expected) CNH could temporarily trade back to 6.75,” according to Jason Daw, head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA in Singapore. “If it all falls apart and tariffs are raised this week and the two sides stop active dialogue, CNH could easily head to 6.90 in the second quarter.”CNH, the yuan traded offshore, was recently at 6.7819 per dollar, down 0.7 per cent.Nomura Holdings Inc. strategist Charlie McElligott said it’s possible the S&P 500’s recent run-up to record levels might have given Trump enough confidence “to absorb a market drawdown and again lean into what some in the administration believe is Chinese ‘slow-playing’ — all in an attempt from to extract additional last-minute deal concessions.”It remains to be seen how U.S. markets might absorb the move in the VIX, after data last week showed hedge funds were shorting the gauge at a record rate. Some have downplayed the significance of that milestone, saying the shorts are offset by longs elsewhere, but for many it brought back memories of the “volmageddon” meltdown of February 2018.Declines in equities could breed yet a further sell-off thanks to the role of quantitative players.Moves by commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, could be triggered around 2,879 on the S&P 500, according to Nomura’s McElligott. That level would be about a 2.3 per cent drop from the gauge’s close on Friday. The futures were at 2,896.50 as of 4:26 p.m. in Hong Kong, after falling as low as 2,883.50 earlier. Another “acceleration point where moves could get sloppy” is 2,890, a level important for some options strategies, he wrote.The key is whether the tweets prove to be an epic incidence of poker playing or “a raging miscalculation with vigilante markets,” McElligott said.Bloomberg’s Jackie Edwards, Masaki Kondo, Adam Haigh, Tomoko Yamazaki, Stephen Spratt and Blaise Robinson contributed.Bloomberg.com"

The central bank’s decision to remove a bias to higher interest rates pushed longer-term government bond yields lower, dropping them below short-term debt. 
 The 3-month government bill yields about 1.68 per cent, compared with 1.67 per cent for the 10-year note, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An inverted government yield curve is seen by some economists as a signal of a looming recession. The curve inverted in late March for the first time since 2007, before returning to normal on April 3. 
 Policy makers in Ottawa led by Governor Poloz left their benchmark overnight rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent for a fourth straight decision Wednesday, and dropped a reference to future increases that had been in every rate statement since the end of 2017. 
 The bank mentioned a series of factors -- from slower global growth to sluggish housing and oil sectors -- that brought Canada’s economy to a near halt over the past six months. It also laid out a more dour growth forecast for this year than economists are expecting. 
 
 The bulk of Canada’s yield curve remains normal, with most long-term rates higher than short-term ones. There is a 16 basis-point gap between two- and 10-year bonds. The U.S. also has an inverted curve, when comparing three-month and 10-year notes. 
 The loonie declined after the dovish rate announcement, dipping close to a four-month low before paring losses. The currency traded at $1.3460 per U.S. dollar at 11:51 a.m. One dollar buys about 74 U.S. cents. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce advised clients to bet on further declines in the Canadian dollar.

Quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!His venting comes as his two recent picks for the Fed, businessman Herman Cain and conservative economist Stephen Moore, have come under fire, with several Republicans indicating Cain may not be able to win confirmation in the Senate.It also comes days after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a frequent target of Trump’s criticism, told lawmakers at a Democratic Party retreat that the central bank won’t bend to political pressure, according to two people in the room for the closed-door event.Trump picked Powell as Fed chairman, replacing Janet Yellen, but later indicated that he regretted the decision, and in late 2018 discussed the feasibility of firing him before appearing to decide against it. Trump has criticized the Fed’s rate increases as it tried to gradually move them to a level that neither stymies nor stimulates growth.The rate hikes have slowed some segments of the economy, such as housing, but overall the U.S. economic expansion continues, along with the lowest unemployment in decades and inflation near the Fed’s 2 per cent target.Lately, Trump has urged the Fed to cut rates to turn the economy into a “rocket ship,” which White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week would be growth in the 4 to 4.5 per cent range.The Federal Reserve raised rates four times in 2018, but has since paused, saying it will be “patient” as it assesses the need for any additional changes in the policy rate, now in a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.U.S. stocks have risen sharply this year after the Fed’s dovish pivot, reversing a late-2018 swoon. The benchmark S&P 500 Index closed Friday at 2,907.41, less than one percent below its record high close from September. U.S. central bankers in March signalled no rate moves in 2019, based on their outlook for solid if unspectacular economic growth with inflation near goal.If Trump was referring to the more narrow Dow Jones Industrial Average, his tweet suggested the index could be over 36,000 points absent the Fed’s moves. The Dow closed on Friday at 26,412.30.Prior to Trump’s tweeting, global policy makers had spent the weekend leaping to the defence of the Fed and other central banks facing pressure from politicians. At talks of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Saturday that he was “certainly worried about central bank independence” and especially “in the most important jurisdiction in the world.”While many politicians want their central banks to juice growth by keeping monetary policy easy, the risk is the political meddling leaves investors worrying about a flare up of inflation and push up market interest rates in response, potentially hurting expansions.Bloomberg.com"

That followed an 11 per cent slump in the fourth quarter. The index isn’t far from the 16,644-level that analysts predicted for the end of 2019, based on estimates gathered in December.“We got in two months what we thought we’d achieve through the course of the year,” Shailesh Kshatriya, director of Canadian investment strategies at Russell Investments, said in a phone interview. “It’s a bit disconcerting.”The gains in global equity markets come down to two main factors: a rebound from the “overly negative move” in the fourth quarter and an increasingly dovish tilt from many of the world’s biggest central banks, Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to clients.Cannabis stocks led the first-quarter gains, making up six of the benchmark’s 10 best performers. However, strategists argue that rate-sensitive sectors like banks, real estate, utilities and telecommunications are the safest bets going forward after U.S. and Canadian yield curves inverted, potentially signalling an impending recession.Dvai Ghose, former global head of equity research at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., expects the Canadian market to soften over the next 12 to 18 months as it gets “caught up by slower economic growth from the U.S.,” even though the fundamentals aren’t too bad, he said.“I don’t think valuations are that stretched, I don’t think macro’s that bad, I’m just saying I think we’ll probably have a couple quarters of recession next year and you’ll see 10, 15 per cent pullbacks,” Ghose, who retired on March 29, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office.Kshatriya is particularly focused on the Canadian business cycle, which “has clearly decelerated over the course of the last 12 months or so” based on trade and consumption data, while earnings revisions have been “deeply negative.”“It’s not unprecedented but it is unusual that you have such sharp negative revisions at a time when the equity markets are pushing higher,” he said. “That would argue for a bit of a pause.”Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, takes the opposite view, arguing that “typically and historically when you see these types of negative moves in revision trends,” it signals that a market rebound is around the corner.“Although unsurprisingly we have seen some softening in fundamentals recently, overall growth remains resilient and supportive of higher valuations,” Belski wrote in a March analysis. “Barring a broad global recession, which we do not expect, the market has likely already priced in a significant economic and earnings slowdown.”Bloomberg.com"

 The iconic American apparel company, which patented the first pair of blue jeans in 1873, filed a plan for an initial public offering Monday that would raise as much as US$587.2 million. The company would sell 36.7 million shares, priced at US$14 to US$16 apiece, according to the regulatory document. 
 Denim has been fighting with leggings and “athleisure” for its share of the casual clothing market. It’s been tough, with imports of elastic knit pants surpassing those of denim for the first time in 2017. But the one-time staple of American closets has recently staged the beginning of a comeback: The jeans category in the U.S. grew 2.2 per cent to US$16.7 billion in 2018 after four straight years of declines, according to data from Euromonitor. 
 The company had been slow to incorporate the comfort of yogawear into its styles by adding stretch, but those efforts eventually paid off, particularly in women’s clothing, which has grown in the double-digits for eight straight quarters and currently represents almost a third of total sales. Global revenue climbed 14 per cent in fiscal 2018 from a year earlier. 
 
 Most of the stock will be sold by current shareholders and Levi Strauss expects to get about US$106.6 million at the midpoint of the range for its own use. It plans to put the proceeds toward general corporate purposes, though some may be used for acquisitions or strategic investments, the company said in the filing. 
 The Details 
 
 Current holders are planning to offer 27.2 million shares, of which the company won’t receive any proceeds. 
 The company is selling about 9.5 million shares. 
 It plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LEVI. 
 The firm, which is controlled by the founding Haas family, filed plans to list in February. The firm is said to be valued at US$5 billion, according to CNBC, giving the family a combined net worth of at least $2.5 billion.

32,Bloomberg News,Kelly Gilblom,Norway deals a blow to an oil industry that's quickly losing friends,"The decision of the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund to reduce holdings in oil stocks wasn’t as far-reaching as the industry feared, but dealt a symbolic blow to fossil fuels that will reverberate for energy companies and their investors.",-1,,-1,,3/8/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/norway-deals-a-blow-to-an-oil-industry-that-s-quickly-losing-friends-1.1226047,,"The decision of the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund to reduce holdings in oil stocks wasn’t as far-reaching as the industry feared, but dealt a symbolic blow to fossil fuels that will reverberate for energy companies and their investors. 
 While the divestment by Norway’s US$1 trillion fund doesn’t include Big Oil, instead rooting out US$7.5 billion of companies that focus purely on exploration and extraction, the impact of the announcement rippled through the sector. Shares of all oil companies initially plunged on the news, suggesting the move sets the industry up for greater disruption. 
 It’s a bitter taste of the new reality for oil producers, which increasingly have to fight for investor dollars rather than enjoying the perks of being indispensable to the global economy. 
 “The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is seen as something of a poster-child amongst sovereign wealth funds,” said Alejandro DeMichelis, director of oil and gas research at Hannam & Partners LLP. “This decision could also trigger other large investors to review their stance toward investing in the oil and gas sector.” 
 Life is changing for oil companies. Ten years ago, they accounted for about 15 per cent of the S&P 500 index. Today, they make up just 5 per cent, having been mostly displaced by technology giants such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. 
 Driving this shift is a smorgasbord of new energy sources that’s bringing unprecedented competition for capital. Consumer choices are set to drift farther from the hydrocarbons of the 20th century, with renewables potentially meeting about a quarter of demand by 2040, according to oil major BP Plc. 
 It’s no surprise, then, that investors are increasingly questioning the wisdom of betting on oil and gas. A divestment campaign started by activist group 350.org in 2012 has already persuaded funds holding US$8 trillion to back away from fossil fuels, according to its website. 
 
 Scrutiny could intensify as AGM season approaches. Catherine Howarth, chief executive officer of ShareAction -- a group that has targeted Royal Dutch Shell Plc in the past -- said she expects a “ramp-up” of pressure at annual general meetings that start in the spring. 
 ‘Vulnerable’ Industry 
 “Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable,” Howarth said in an email. 
 It’s not only oil companies facing pressure. One of the world’s biggest sellers of coal, Glencore Plc, yielded to investor demands earlier this year by promising to limit production of the fuel and align the business with Paris climate targets. In oil and gas, Shell and BP have made pledges around transparency and climate after facing the wrath of shareholders. 
 The list of companies to be excluded from the Norwegian fund includes Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Cnooc Ltd. and Tullow Oil Plc. Shale producers like EOG Resources Inc., which extract fuel from the heartland of America’s oil and gas boom, are also included. 
 Higher Costs 
 In the longer term, a dearth of capital will push up the cost of borrowing to explore for oil and gas, with those costs likely passed on to consumers, according to Georgi Slavov, head of research at energy broker Marex Spectron. That makes renewables comparatively cheaper, further pushing fossil fuels out of the market. 
 While Shell, BP and other oil majors were spared in Norway’s decision on Friday, they may yet be earmarked for divestment in the future. 
 “The country may eventually revisit the issue and target such holdings,” said Rob Barnett, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In particular, the fund could consider shedding “integrated companies not allocating a portion of their capital spending toward clean energy.” 
 For those oil companies moving to diversify, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. In its statement, Norway said some of the biggest investments in renewables now come from Big Oil. The fund “should be able to participate in this growth,” the Finance Ministry said. 
 “While the fund was initially built on revenue from oil and gas, the Ministry of Finance understands that the future belongs to those who transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mark Campanale, founding director of energy researcher Carbon Tracker. “Now is the time for smart investors around the world to follow their lead and make decisions driven by the reality of the energy transition.”"

In the second quarter, the firm will also start raising $50 million for a fund that will co-invest with Trichome in cannabis debt transactions.Debt financing has been relatively rare in the volatile pot industry, where companies have typically relied on equity to raise funds as traditional bankers shied away from the space. Some of the bigger cannabis companies are beginning to offer convertible debt. Canopy Growth Corp., Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Tilray Inc. — the industry’s largest companies — have issued $1.3 billion of such securities, but they have yet to issue a straight bond.“In any sort of credit market, you know, you’ve got the banks and the bank loan market and the high yield market, and then the mezzanine market, you have private lenders. And so there’s a whole ecosystem here,” said Ruscetta, who was co-head of Goldman Sachs’ Canada Special Situations Group between 2006 and 2008.In the cannabis industry “We’ve got nothing, right? We’re kind of at the very start of banks lending to the Canopys and Auroras,” he added. “But they’re kind of doing that because there’s other business for them to get involved in them.”Trichome is already financing cannabis companies’ supply, taking receivables as a guarantee, he said. The company is seeking to expand into financing mergers and acquisitions and restructurings later on. It’s targeting internal rates of return at around 15 per cent, though that could vary if leverage is added, he said.Trichome, whose largest shareholder is pot brands company Origin House, plans to go public via a reverse takeover on the TSX Venture Exchange in the spring. The company will only lend to Canadian firms at first but is looking to develop a structure that will allow it to lend elsewhere, including the U.S. where pot is still illegal at the federal level, Ruscetta said.The firm’s focus is lending to all cannabis firms except for the 10 largest producers, as they are already well supported by the banks, he said.Trichome announced Tuesday it will proceed with the issuance of subscription receipts that turn into common shares once all the paperwork on the reverse takeover is complete, the company said in a statement.Before joining Trichome in 2018, Ruscetta managed the RCM Special Situations Fund. He previously was managing director of Amaranth Advisors (Canada) ULC, a multi-strategy investment fund as well as investment banker at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.Bloomberg.com"

The ambiguity caused the almost-decade-long rally in U.S. stocks to come within a whisker of its end in December.“It seems like there has to be an elevated probability of a recession this year or next year,” the Yale University economics professor said during a panel discussion at the InsideETFs conference in Hollywood, Fla. “There are these signs that show people are worried. It’s also the longest bull market in the stock market,” he said. “There’s a spirit of thinking –- it ought to come to an end soon.”The chance of a recession happening over the next 12 months is 25 per cent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in Mississippi that “we don’t feel the probability of recession is at all elevated.”The ongoing debate makes it all the more important to focus on how the markets are interrelated, said Jeffrey Sherman, DoubleLine Capital LP’s deputy chief investment officer. Rates are higher compared with recent history, we’ve seen margins compress a bit, and it’s possible GDP growth slows down to trend — closer to two per cent, he said. When it comes to investing, everyone needs some stocks in their portfolios, they just have to be “more cautious,” Sherman said during the panel discussion.“You have peak earnings and peak euphoria,” Sherman said. “The question becomes, how does corporate America respond at this stage? It doesn’t look horrible.”Shiller and DoubleLine have a long relationship. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund puts the majority of its investments into a fixed-income portfolio, while at the same time employing derivatives to gain exposure to large-cap equities that are undervalued based on an index created by Shiller. Launched in 2013, the fund’s five-year track record puts the product in the 99th percentile when compared with peers, according to a Bloomberg ranking.The cyclically adjusted P-E ratio (CAPE), which Shiller developed 30 years ago, uses 10 years of earnings in its calculations to gauge stock market valuations. Right now the measure comes in around 30, which is “quite high” according to Shiller, especially considering that’s about double the historical average. Going forward, though, the ratio should come down just because of time — the worst earnings during the financial crisis should fall out of the equation soon.“That doesn’t mean you expect negative returns,” Shiller said.Bloomberg.com"

Toronto and Vancouver posted their worst year for sales in at least a decade last year. Vancouver’s market waned further in January as average prices tumbled 9.1 per cent over the past 12 months.“This is not something that’s just spontaneously happening: This is an engineered slowdown with the banks being willing participants in some of these changes that have been made,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in an interview. “It makes for a healthier lending environment and a healthier housing environment for the longer term.”An overinflated housing market and high debt are among the reasons cited by some U.S. hedge funds and short-sellers over the years who have bet against the Canadian banks. On average, about 2.4 per cent of shares of the six biggest Canadian banks is held in short-interest positions as of the end of January, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Vindication for those shorts appears some way off for now. The eight-member S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index has tread water for about two years. It gained about 3.3 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent increase in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and a 4.4 per cent gain in the U.S. KBW Bank Index.Canadian bank executives have already been conveying their expectations for slower growth this year.Toronto-Dominion Bank’s Teri Currie, who oversees the domestic banking division at Canada’s largest bank by assets, expects “mid-single digit” growth this year in residential secured lending, which includes amortizing home-equity credit lines and mortgages.“In today’s context it’s sending a strong statement that the investments that we’ve made are going to pay off in relatively good growth,” she said in a Jan. 22 interview.Executives at rival banks are expecting domestic mortgage growth to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2019, when the country’s economic expansion is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent.Investor David Baskin, whose Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion, said he’d rather banks focus on wealth management. “I’m not looking for the banks to grow their mortgage business,” he said. “I don’t think that’s where the juice is.”Steve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7.5 billion, said the banks are countering the slowdown in residential lending with growth in business loans — something that makes Belisle a bit uneasy. Canada’s six biggest banks had an 11 per cent jump in commercial lending last year.“The overall loan growth for the banks is actually steady — it has been around 4.5 per cent — and that’s because they are offsetting the slowdown in mortgages with commercial lending, which is low double digits,” Belisle said. “That’s adding risk at the peak of the economic cycle.”Bloomberg.com"

But for shares of energy companies, it hasn’t been as much of a help.Since the production curtailment was unveiled early last month, Western Canadian Select crude has almost doubled to about $43 a barrel, narrowing its discount to benchmark U.S. oil to an almost decade-low of $6.95 a barrel on Jan. 11. Yet in that same time, the S&P/TSX Energy Index is up less than 4 per cent.Driving the stagnant performance are the forced cuts in output among the larger producers as well as a series of conservative moves by smaller drillers who are less affected by the program. Overall, the industry is dialling back spending and waiting for better days — a strategy that analysts have lauded as prudent but that investors have found less than compelling.“Certainly the curtailment program has helped the cash flows, but it’s sending a clear signal: ‘You can’t grow. Don’t even try,’” said Laura Lau, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto.The larger producers that are most affected by the curtailment, such as Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Cenovus Energy Inc., are all planning on flat or reduced spending next year.Smaller drillers who aren’t forced to cut as much output are following suit. Whitecap Resources Inc. said last month that it’s keeping spending in line with last year’s levels and heavily weighting it to the second half. Crescent Point Energy Corp. said last week that it’s slashing its spending by $500 million to about $1.3 billion and trimming its dividend.The frugality has even spread beyond the oil industry to gas producers, much of whose output goes to fuel oilsands operations. Peyto Exploration & Development Corp. last week set a capital budget of $150 million to $200 million for the year, down $100 million from the forecast it gave in November, and cut its dividend.While many of those moves were cheered by analysts, investors were less enthused. In the first trading session after announcing their plans, Peyto slid 11 per cent, Crescent Point fell 1.3 per cent and Whitecap dropped 6.8 per cent.The message that companies are sending to investors is that they don’t have confidence that the long-term problems the industry is facing — such as the inability to get new pipelines built — will be fixed, Lau said. And even though the curtailment program is achieving its goal of boosting Canadian crude prices, the fact that it was even needed sends a negative signal to investors, she said.“If Alberta, which I’d argue is the most entrepreneurial of the provinces, is seeking government intervention, it just shows things are really bad,” Lau said.Bloomberg.com"

 The messaging platform company is choosing the unusual method for going public because it doesn’t need the cash or publicity of an IPO, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. Slack hasn’t filed with U.S. regulators for the listing yet and it’s unclear when it will because of the continuing shutdown of the federal government, the person said. 
 The share sale, which might take place toward mid-year, could value Slack at more than US$7 billion, according to the person, who added that the company’s plans could still change. 
 A representative for San Francisco-based Slack declined to comment. The company was valued at US$7.1 billion in a US$427 million funding round in August. 
 If Slack goes ahead with a direct listing, it will follow music streaming service Spotify Technology SA, which began trading in New York using that method in April. In an IPO, underwriters hammer out the number of shares to sell and at what price, and then take their fees out of the proceeds from an offering. A direct listing allows current investors to offer their stakes directly to new shareholders priced purely on demand. 
 Slack’s plans were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. 
 U.S. share listings are facing delays as the government shutdown hits regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. Anticipated IPOs that may face continuing delays include Lyft Inc., which announced in December that it had filed confidentially for an IPO, and Uber Technologies Inc., which also filed confidentially last month, a person familiar with the matter has said. 
 Slack’s plans may be more directly affected by the shutdown than if it was pursuing an IPO, as the unusual process is likely to require more interaction with regulators.

37,Bloomberg News,"Abhishek Vishnoi, Min Jeong Lee and Matthew Burgess",‘Completely bizarre’ stock moves leave traders scratching heads,"As a turbulent December in equity markets draws to a close, there’s one thing traders and investors can agree on: these are not usual times, especially for this time of year.",-1,,-1,,12/27/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/completely-bizarre-stock-moves-leave-traders-scratching-heads-1.1188516,,"As a turbulent December in equity markets draws to a close, there’s one thing traders and investors can agree on: these are not usual times, especially for this time of year. 
 It’s “completely bizarre,” says Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides.” 
 Innes has been taking profit on some winning investments, and snapping up blue-chip stocks whose valuations have dropped in the December selloff, but for the most part he’s keeping his money on the sidelines. Like many other traders in Asia, he’s been watching events play out in the U.S. from a distance, amazed at what he sees. 
 The S&P 500 Index posted its biggest upward reversal since 2010 on Thursday, a day after the gauge capped its largest advance since 2009. Despite the two-day gain, the measure is still down almost 10 per cent in December alone. “I’m on the golf course,” Innes says about how he’s responding. “As I have been most of the week.” 
 Mark Matthews, head of Asia research at Bank Julius Baer & Co. in Singapore, says two “golden rules” have been broken. First, since 1945, December has produced the highest average gains of any month, he says, but this month is set to be the worst of the year. Second, since the 1970s, the S&P 500 has never slumped when earnings growth was more than 10 per cent, according to him. But as a long-only investor, Matthews is planning to ride it out. “I remain invested through good times and bad,” he says. “Not being invested, over the long term, is like betting against the house in a casino.” 
 Over in Sydney, Sean Fenton is scratching his head. “It’s certainly unusual for this time of year,” the portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners says of the market moves. “You see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility.” Fenton, like Matthews, says he’s hunkering down, betting that the U.S. economy is robust and the sell-off will bottom out. For this time of year, he’s “probably a little more focused on the market,” he says, but that doesn’t mean he’s got reasons for the moves. “Trying to explain short-term movements in the markets is an exercise in futility because generally it’s pretty random,” he says. 
 In Tokyo, Hajime Sakai is just staying away from trading. The chief fund manager at Mito Securities Co. admits the whole thing took him by surprise. “I can’t really say I’ve been dealing with it,” he says. “I wasn’t quite able to respond.” That’s partly because of the time lag between when he makes a trading decision and when the trade is executed, which is often a day or two later. In markets this choppy, that gap makes trading close to impossible. “We’re increasingly faced with situations where the price is completely different at the point of execution versus when we made the decision,” he says. 
 
 Hold Cash 
 “We have never seen the U.S. market dropping at this magnitude and speed for the past eight to nine years,” says Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. Yang’s solution is to go overweight cash for the time being. She expects the volatility to continue until year-end, until investors get a clearer picture from the holiday earnings season. But longer-term, she doesn’t know if this will prove a “healthy correction” as investors find the S&P 500’s low valuations attractive and earnings come in above expectations, or if it will mark the end of the 10-year bull run. Either way, one thing’s for certain: “The recent movement is definitely unusual,” she says. 
 In South Korea, Lee Dong-jun agrees. The head of the global investment team at DB Asset Management in Seoul has also been staying as clear of the market as possible this week, tending only to existing investments and keeping away from new trades. “This isn’t normal,” he says of the market turbulence. “Investor sentiment is very bad.” And while “we don’t think this kind of huge volatility will persist,” he says, “our thinking is that it’s not a good idea to actively trade stocks in a market like this.”"

Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, as tensions between the nations continue to escalate.“According to the China-Canada consular agreement, if a Chinese citizen is arrested by the Canadian government, the Canadian government should immediately notify the Chinese embassy,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing on Monday. “But the Canadian government didn’t do that.”Despite follow-up questions on when Beijing found out about the detention, Lu declined to provide more details.Over the weekend, Chinese authorities separately summoned the ambassadors of Canada and the U.S. to protest Meng’s arrest on allegations she committed fraud to sidestep sanctions against Iran. The case has become a flash-point in ties between the U.S. and China that’s rattled investors and sent stock markets tumbling.Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng warned Canada’s ambassador that his nation could face “severe consequences” if it didn’t release Meng immediately. Le said earlier in a separate statement that U.S. actions have violated the “legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and are extremely bad in nature,” while also pledging further action.China and the U.S. are grappling with how to react to the incident, which threatens to upend progress in trade talks achieved in Argentina. President Donald Trump’s trade team sought to insulate talks with China from the growing dispute on Sunday, while officials in Beijing have debated the pros and cons of retaliation.On Friday, the U.S. began a case against the Chinese telecoms giant in a Vancouver courtroom, alleging Meng had hidden ties between Huawei and a company called Skycom that did business in Iran, a lawyer representing Canada said during the court hearing. Canada is presenting the case on behalf of the U.S., which wants to extradite Meng.Her lawyers have cited health issues in a bid to free the Huawei finance chief, painting a picture of a cancer survivor who’s undergone multiple surgeries and needs daily medication to cope with a plethora of health issues. They also outlined how her entire family has deep roots in Vancouver, where she’s being held. She’s also offered to put up a couple of multi-million-dollar homes as collateral.Meng’s case has struck a nerve with Chinese officials in part because Huawei, founded by her father Ren Zhengfei, is a national champion at the forefront of President Xi Jinping’s efforts for China to be self-sufficient in strategic technologies.Along with Huawei’s growing prominence has come increased scrutiny from the U.S. and its allies over fears its equipment could be used for spying, with Kyodo News reporting that Japan could join Australia and New Zealand in keeping Chinese equipment away from their phone networks. China seeks fair, transparent and non-discriminatory treatment from Japan, Lu said.Lu also pushed back against comments from those in other nations who allege Huawei may pose a security threat, saying there isn’t any evidence of cyber-security problems.“I want to stress that the Chinese laws and regulations do not authorize any institutions to force any enterprise to install forced backdoors,” Lu said. “The Chinese government always encourages its enterprises to abide by international rules and local laws.”Bloomberg.com"

 Continued bluster on U.S.-China trade, a flattening yield curve and predictions for a 2019 earnings slowdown have helped send the S&P 500 Index down more than 3 per cent since he last weighed in. It swung at least 1 per cent one way or the other on eight days in that span, and is now negative for the year.

 Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives cut his price target to US$275 from US$310 on Wednesday, the latest investment bank to do so on iPhone demand concerns. However, he affirmed his outperform rating and wrote that Apple remains one of its “favorite tech names heading into 2019 despite the horror show over the last month seen out of Cupertino.” 
 He added that “while this sell off has been a painful one that is hard to stomach for tech investors and caused many of our peers to move to the sidelines on the name,” his long-term bullish thesis remains intact. In a note to clients he cited the company’s valuation as well as a “further monetization of its 750+ million active iPhone installed base through future upgrades and a US$50 billion+ services revenue stream.” 
 The comments echoed a recent report from Morgan Stanley, which also touted Apple’s services business and argued that the recent decline had been overdone. 
 
 Apple shares have plunged almost 25 per cent from a record high in early October, a slump that ended the company’s multiyear streak as the largest stock by market capitalization. The stock has dropped more than 20 per cent thus far this month, putting it on track for its biggest monthly decline since September 2008, during the financial crisis. The shares rebounded 1.3 per cent pre-market on Wednesday. 
 Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote that the sell-off was “the most abrupt in Apple’s history,” and suggested “a good amount of ‘bad news’ might already be priced in” to the shares. 
 “It is difficult to know with certainty where AAPL’s FY 19 EPS estimates could go, but we have stress tested our model, and find it difficult to see EPS declining below FY 18 levels or for iPhone ASPs to decline” year-over-year, he wrote, referring to average selling prices. 
 Despite that, Sacconaghi suggested that Apple shares may see further downside before recovering. 
 “Sell-side estimates have only been revised downwards by -0.8 per cent so far, and history suggests that the stock is unlikely to inflect until estimates stop coming down,” he wrote to clients, affirming his market perform rating and $210 price target. That’s 21 percent above the stock’s last closing price."

 DionyMed, which owns cannabis brands and distribution platforms in California and Oregon, will have a market value of about $300 million, Chief Executive Officer Edward Fields said in an interview. He expects the company to generate US$70 million in revenue this year and US$197 million next year. 
 The firm plans to expand into other states following the recent midterm elections, which saw Michigan legalize recreational marijuana and a changing of the guard to a more pro-pot Congress. Cannabis remains illegal federally in the U.S. 
 “We’re quite optimistic about the improvement around banking issues and tax issues and compliance issues federally, and I think that’s part of the call to arms for expanding and having a true national footprint,” Fields said. “We are actively working on our expansion plans in Nevada, Massachusetts, Colorado and other cannabis-friendly markets.” 
 DionyMed will trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange via a reverse takeover under the ticker DYME. A date for the debut hasn’t been set.

53,Bloomberg News,Sofia Horta e Costa and Fox Hu,Here are the reasons China's equity rout is getting even worse,"Chinese equities have already lost US$3 trillion in market value since January, and hopes for better days ahead are fading.",-1,?affecting TSX?,-1,,10/26/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/here-are-the-reasons-china-s-equity-rout-is-getting-even-worse-1.1158606,,"Chinese equities have already lost US$3 trillion in market value since January, and hopes for better days ahead are fading. 
 Anyone counting on a breather in this year’s final stretch got slapped with another 8.4 per cent drop for the Shanghai Composite Index so far in October, putting it on course for its worst month since early 2016. That sets the gauge up for its third-worst annual performance ever, behind a 65 per cent meltdown at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and a 22 per cent plunge in 1994. China has become the world’s worst place to own stocks in 2018. 
 Reasons to flee the nation’s stocks have piled up this year, starting with a liquidity squeeze spurred by China’s deleveraging campaign that’s led to record bonds defaults and hurt economic growth. Add to that a worsening trade war, rising interest rates and the strong U.S. dollar souring the outlook for emerging-market assets, and Chinese stocks are now facing a downward spiral made worse by the billions of dollars of shares at risk of forced selling. 
 Here’s a look at everything that’s weighing on sentiment: 
 Shadow financing, which includes entrusted loans, trust loans and bank acceptances, is getting worse. Its outstanding volume shrank for a seventh straight month in September, reaching its lowest since January 2017. A government-orchestrated campaign to cut leverage has squeezed private companies that relied on such funding channels, as banks have curbed lending. 
 Another hit to sentiment came in the past two days, when quarterly statements showed five funds linked to the Chinese government sold all their stock holdings. That prompted speculation about whether Beijing will help put a floor on equity prices, with investors wondering if the move suggests its so-called “national team” is withdrawing from the market. 
 There’s also the threat coming from brokers and banks, which account for more than half of the US$640 billion of shares pledged for loans. The stock rout may force lenders to sell equities, accelerating a vicious circle. 
 The strength in the greenback -- the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index hit its highest level since June 2017 this week -- has also been a key reason of concern. That’s prompted an exodus from emerging-market assets and increased pressure on the yuan. In the latest sign that capital outflows are picking up, Chinese banks sold the most foreign currency to their clients since December 2016, data by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange showed Thursday. 
 It doesn’t help that markets around the globe are sinking, giving stock investors nowhere to hide. In the U.S., tech shares have been pummeled, with companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. being the latest to give disappointing earnings results. Equities worldwide have lost almost US$7.8 trillion in market value this month alone, and US$15 trillion since January. 
 That’s all added up to a turbulent ride for Chinese stock traders: The Shanghai Composite Index is on track to post its wildest average intraday moves since January 2016 this month. Investors have rushed to hedge against swings, pushing the number of options linked to an exchange-traded fund tracking Shanghai’s SSE 50 Index to levels never seen before.

55,Bloomberg News,,China’s stock rout puts US$613B of share pledges at risk,The rout in Chinese equities is throwing the spotlight on US$613 billion of shares pledged as collateral for loans.,-1,,-1,,10/16/2018,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-stock-rout-puts-us-613b-of-share-pledges-at-risk-1.1153041,,"The rout in Chinese equities is throwing the spotlight on US$613 billion of shares pledged as collateral for loans. 
 Loans extended to company founders and other major investors who pledged their shareholdings as collateral emerged as a popular financing channel in recent years. But given the losses in equities -- Shenzhen’s stock benchmark is down 34 per cent in 2018 -- there’s a growing risk that brokerages will be forced to sell the shares, accelerating the downturn. 
 At least 35 companies have seen pledged shares liquidated by brokerages since the start of June, more than triple the 10 in the first five months of the year, according to company filings. At least two firms announced after Monday’s close that their shares were at risk of forced selling, including Jilin Zixin Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., which plunged by the 10 per cent daily limit. 
 ""There’s a liquidity crisis in the stock market, and pledged shares are again starting to sound the alarm,"" said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities Co. ""If there are no real policies to cure the array of problems and ailments in our market, no one will be willing to take the risk."" 
 About 4.24 trillion yuan (US$613 billion) of shares have been pledged as collateral for loans, according to Bloomberg calculations using China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp. data, accounting for about 11 per cent of the country’s stock market capitalization. 
 Forced selling is adding to the long list of issues facing investors in China’s US$5.3 trillion market, from worsening trade ties with the U.S. to concerns of slowing domestic demand and a slumping yuan. In a sign of how bearish sentiment is, margin debt has fallen to four-year lows. 
 The government has taken steps to limit forced selling, but it’s failed to slow this year’s US$3 trillion rout. 
 Brokerages were told to seek government approval before selling shares pledged as collateral for loans, Bloomberg News reported in June, while the top financial regulator said in August it’s closely watching corporate stock pledges. 
 Even a meeting by the chief securities regulator with investors last weekend didn’t engender confidence: The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 2.3 per cent in the two days after to a four-year low. 
 Stocks in the hi-tech hub of Shenzhen have been worst hit, partly due to the dominance of privately-run startups. The city’s equity index is on pace for its worst year since 2008, while about one-fifth of the gauge’s more than 2,000 stocks have lost at least half of their value. 
 ""The risks in share-pledged loans will continue to grow if the stock market falls further,"" said Shen Bifan, chief strategist at Shenzhen Spruces Capital Management Co. ""Major shareholders usually tend to increase collateral to avoid forced selling. The problem is that some borrowers have already pledged everything they have."""

 As the Philippine Stock Exchange Index dipped below 7,100 during Tuesday’s session, taking its valuation to its lowest level since January 2016, Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. is among the firms that’s staying on the sidelines. John Padilla, the head of equities at the money manager, says he’s too concerned about the high inflation level, rising oil prices, weakening peso, increasing interest rates and drying up liquidity. 
 “Everybody is bracing and positioning for a higher inflation, and with oil continuing its climb there isn’t anything to say that’s enticing to go bargain hunting at this point,” said Padilla, who helps manage 450 billion pesos (US$8.3 billion). “It used to be that a buy-on-weakness strategy works, but now for prudence it’s better to step aside and let the market take its course.” 
 The Philippine Stock Exchange has plunged 17 per cent since the end of December, becoming the world’s biggest losing equity market and taking its valuation to 15 times estimated earnings for the next year, below its five-year average. The gauge fell as much as 0.5 per cent to 7,095.26 on Wednesday. 
 The recent sell-off from emerging markets and U.S.-China trade frictions only added to worries over the nation’s headwinds. Overseas investors have withdrawn almost US$1.6 billion in 2018, exceeding inflows from the past four years. 
 Padilla said it’s not improbable for the Philippine stock gauge to fall below 7,000 in the near term and that it could go as low as 6,600. He said his firm will change its underweight call on the equities should consumer prices, the peso, interest rates and liquidity show improvements. September inflation data are due on Friday. 
 “You can get a better return with your cash in time deposit now rather than exposing it to equities, where at best you get a flat return but run the risk of losing part of your money if you buy the wrong name,” Padilla said. 
 The country’s shares will face more challenges before things get better, according to Michael Enriquez, the chief investment officer of Sun Life of Canada Philippines Inc. The PSEi could stay at around 7,100 this year, with earnings growth of 5.5 per cent compared with 10 per cent to 12 per cent consensus, he said. To put that into perspective, the key stock gauge closed at almost 8,559 at the end of last year. 
 Steven Ko, who helps manage 60 billion pesos at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., sees further risk as limited. While the benchmark index may drop to 6,900, he says there’s also a chance it could climb to 8,000 this year as sentiment improves. He expects inflation to peak and says the peso may have already seen its sharpest depreciation this year. 
 “We are still holding on to our cash, but we are selectively buying some of the oversold names that are already worth looking into,” Ko said. He favors property stocks because he sees higher earnings-growth prospects and likes banks as he deems them unduly hit by the rout."

 The S&P 500 Index broke its three-day win streak but still notched a second positive week in a row after reaching a new high Thursday. Quadruple witching -- when futures and options on indexes and individual stocks expire -- and the largest revision to the Global Industry Classification Standard since 1999 may be behind the slide and the higher-than-average volumes. More than 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges Friday, 64 per cent higher than the three-month average. 
 “The big news this week has been a good balance in emerging market stocks,” Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, said by phone. “There’s hope among market participants that the various trade tensions between the U.S. and China will ultimately be contained or won’t be big enough to derail the global economic cycle. I think today the market is just hanging out after the various indexes have made new highs this week.” 
 Earlier, the bullish mood that characterized most of the week buoyed global equity markets. Stocks rallied in Europe and Asia, and the MSCI All-Country World Index was poised for a seven-month high. Treasury yields held above 3 per cent. The dollar and commodities gained. 
 The pound sank after Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.K. and European Union were “at an impasse” on Brexit. The euro slipped from a three-month high after data showed euro-area expansion edged lower in September. Italian bonds climbed as Finance Minister Giovanni Tria prepares a draft budget. In Japan, news that the BOJ is trimming purchases of debt maturing in more than 25 years helped boost 20-year and 30-year government bond yields. 
 Raw materials, stocks and emerging-market assets are all rallying as investors bet the global economic expansion is intact despite the latest data from Europe and the escalating trade war. The Bloomberg Commodity Index climbed to its highest level in more than a month, fueled by gains in crude oil and copper. 
 Emerging-market stocks and currencies extended a rally. Indian stocks bucked the developing-nation trend, however, as a plunge in banks set off an exodus from financial shares. 
 The big rearrangement of the GICS takes effect Sept. 24, with the creation of the communication services group. The new industry category will include three of the four FANG stocks -- Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix -- and could force investors who track indexes based on the classification to reshuffle their money.

 The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index advanced 0.2 per cent, the biggest gain in a week. The euro fell 0.2 per cent to US$1.1755. The British pound sank 1.4 per cent to US$1.3085, the biggest drop in almost a year. The Japanese yen declined 0.1 per cent to 112.56 per dollar.

 Shares of Tilray Inc. have rallied more than 1,000 per cent since the Canadian pot firm went public in July, leaving some of the most hyped digital-currency companies in the dust. By comparison, Riot Blockchain Inc. only surged around 400 per cent after the former machinery maker for the biotech industry ditched its old name, Bioptix Inc., in October. 
 Tilray shares skyrocketed 50 per cent on Wednesday alone after Chief Executive Officer Brendan Kennedy claimed the company may one day be among a few other players in the industry with a valuation north of US$100 billion. That followed a 30 per cent increase on Tuesday after the firm got approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import cannabis into the U.S. for medical research. 
 Tilray isn’t alone. Alkaline Water Co. and New Age Beverages Corp. also rallied recently after eyeing cannabis-related drinks. 
 Companies that rebranded with crypto or blockchain late last year saw dramatic gains in their share prices, but the euphoria was short lived. Many of the stocks plummeted when the Bitcoin bubble burst. Long Blockchain Inc. had lost 90 per cent of its value around 75 trading days after Bitcoin’s peak. Some have speculated that we’re in the midst of a market rotation from crypto to cannabis. 
 “Crypto traders I know are getting into pot stocks,” Jeffrey Van de Leemput, founder of investing-education platform Cryptocampus, said in a message. “But I don’t know if that’s a pattern or just coincidence.”

 The Iceland-based low-cost carrier hired Arion Bank and Arctica Finance to prepare for an initial public offering in 12 to 18 months, it said late on Tuesday, when it also published details about a bond issue. The 60 million euros (US$70 million) bond, maturing in three years, will pay a 9 per cent coupon. That’s the highest interest of any bond by a European airline denominated in euros or U.S. dollars that’s still actively trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
 Wow Air needs funds to pursue an aggressive growth plan - a strategy that has caused the demise of other airlines on the continent. While Norwegian Air Shuttle has fended off takeover approaches by IAG SA and is trying to fix its balance sheet, Italy’s former flag carrier Alitalia remains insolvent. Germany’s Small Planet Airlines filed for insolvency on Tuesday, while Air Berlin, the country’s second-largest airline, and Monarch Airlines in the U.K. folded last year. 
 Rising oil prices are another factor weighing on airline profitability. Wow Air isn’t hedged against the risk but may reconsider that stance, Chief Executive Officer Skuli Mogensen told the Financial Times. The carrier hopes to raise between US$200 million and US$300 million from the sale of less than half in the company, he said."
