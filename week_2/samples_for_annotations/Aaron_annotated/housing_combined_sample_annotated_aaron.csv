Add in provincial deficits, and the shortfall rises to about $500 billion, or net debt of 90 per cent of the nation’s output in 2020-21, the analysts estimate.“These figures may catch the eye of rating agencies and could jeopardize Canada’s AAA rating particularly if the economy continues to underperform in 2021 and beyond,” they wrote. They expect that is likely, “given how growth has come almost exclusively from housing and energy over the last decade,” they said.The budget deficit of Ontario, the world’s largest sub-sovereign debt issuer, will be more than double the latest official government projections as its economy contracts 9 per cent in 2020 from the coronavirus shock, the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, a provincial fiscal watchdog, said earlier this week.Quebec, which was running surpluses before the COVID-19 crisis, said it is on track to post a budget deficit between $12 billion and $15 billion and it will need as long as five years to balance its book again, the province’s Finance Minister Eric Girard said Wednesday.Bloomberg.com"

The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"
53,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Sandrine Rastello,A fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec,Quebec is urging its population to buy from local firms through an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu,,,0,,2020-04-25,https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/a-fight-against-amazon-becomes-a-state-matter-in-quebec,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-3.jpg,"The coronavirus crisis is giving Quebec’s nationalist government an excuse to attempt what may be impossible.The Canadian province is embarking on an uphill battle to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.’s position. Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers’ digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu — or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province’s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe’s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon’s dominance.“People will be able to see what’s available in their region,” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. “There’s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.”Quebec’s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company’s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.The track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.“There’s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,” Lecours said. “Still, let’s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it’s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?”Efforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch — including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.’s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV’s beer.When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer — an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.“An initiative to promote local commerce isn’t an initiative against free trade,” Fitzgibbon said then. “It’s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.”The Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn’t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it’s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the “Buy Quebec” movement to stay.“No one can compete with Amazon,” she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don’t sell on the behemoth’s platform, “we have some exclusivity they don’t have.”Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.’s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling “Black Friday level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault’s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.“I made no money,” he said. Shipping costs “is what’s hurting everyone.”Taillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket’s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers’ attention.“Our goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,” he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, “it will have been worth it.”Bloomberg.com"
2,Bloomberg News,Natalie Obiko Pearson,"Once safer than gold, Canadian real estate braces for reckoning",Canadian housing once seemed so infallible that the head of the world’s biggest asset manager in 2015 described Vancouver condos as a better store of wealth than gold.,,,-1,,2020-04-15,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/once-safer-than-gold-canadian-real-estate-braces-for-reckoning-1.1422032,,"Canadian housing once seemed so infallible that the head of the world’s biggest asset manager in 2015 described Vancouver condos as a better store of wealth than gold. The coronavirus is putting that theory to the test. While lockdowns, job losses and uncertainty are roiling property markets from the U.K. to Australia to Hong Kong, Canada’s situation is more precarious than most. As its oil sector shriveled in recent years, Canada’s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support. What’s more, its households are among the world’s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm. “I think it is the Great Reckoning,” says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. “We’ve been in a period for so long where it didn’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.” Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties. That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. “Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?” asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. “Where exactly do we draw the line?” A ‘Flammable’ Market The country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada’s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent. If it collapses, there’s not much that can pick up the slack -- certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer.Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven’t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiraled higher, homeowners felt richer -- they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher. That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year. It’s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city’s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents. Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up -- “Don’t use your house like an ATM” -- as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties. Today, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 -- a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis. Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt -- an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country’s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust. “You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,” says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. “And this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.” Airbnb Customers Vanish It doesn’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only two per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas. That’s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September. For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections. Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada’s Airbnb hosts -- who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 -- need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month. Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings. Shaky Pillars Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labor market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up. Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labor shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back. In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses. “It’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter’s grandchildren aren’t even going to be able to pay this off,” says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. “What’s the plan after?”"

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what’s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.“This is freezing the market,” John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. “The best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don’t think anyone’s really expecting anything before that.”Real estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada’s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it’s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it’s all but shut down in Quebec.It’s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven’t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.“We’re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it’s ridiculous,” he says. “Why would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.”Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a “tough but temporary blow” to Canada’s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.“The longer this goes, the more it’s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,” said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. “So it’ll affect qualifications.”The uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.“People aren’t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,” Collu said in a phone interview. “Purchase activity is going to be curtailed.”Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.“We see the outlook improving markedly next year,” RBC’s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. “Exceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.”Papailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and “you can go outside without getting your children or parents sick — I think the market is going to go bananas.”Elton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there’s a broader recession — and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.“There’s the big unknown — the elephant south of the border,” said Ash.Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada’s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.“More stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,” Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They’ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.Toronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program — between $50 billion and $75 billion — to be announced at the central bank’s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.“The BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,” Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.The Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.“There is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy — but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,” Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.“We can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,” CIBC’s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"

This includes $27 billion in direct support for individuals and companies and $55 billion in temporary tax deferrals for both households and businesses.It’s a significant escalation in Canada’s stimulus package, and the urgency appears to be ramping up by the hour. Late Tuesday night, government officials were only talking about the direct stimulus aspect of the plan.The outlook, however, seems to be deteriorating quickly. The price of Canadian heavy crude slumped Wednesday below US$10 a barrel for the first time after oil-sands producers were forced to delay maintenance, pushing more oil into the market at the worst possible time.“Right now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting an income or revenue because of this COVID-19 challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, pay their rent, and support their families through this difficult time,” Trudeau said.At a separate press conference, Finance Minister Bill Morneau called Wednesday’s measures the “first phase” of the response and said the government is prepared to do more if needed. “I will do whatever it takes,” he said. “There will be more to come.”Global financial markets are continuing to slide as the economic fallout from the pandemic outpaces even the massive response from governments and central banks.Trudeau also confirmed an announcement earlier by President Donald Trump that Canada and the U.S. have agreed to close the world’s longest undefended border to all non-essential traffic.The measures announced Wednesday include steps to bolster child benefit payments, a $10 billion emergency care program to workers who stay home and don’t have access to paid sick leave, and a 10 per cent wage subsidy to eligible small businesses for the next 90 days. The bulk of the support is a plan to allow taxpayers to defer filing until after Aug. 31 — a temporary liquidity support.Wednesday’s package brings the support offered to businesses and individuals to more than $500 billion during the crisis, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The country’s banking regulator is loosening capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity, while the country’s housing agency is buying up to $50 billion in mortgages to provide liquidity.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who was also at the Morneau press conference, has cut interest rates by a full percentage over the past two weeks and moved aggressively to keep money flowing through credit markets. Investors are anticipating another half percentage point cut in coming weeks.Asked why he hasn’t moved since the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Sunday, Poloz said he would like the “benefit of analysis” of the recent fiscal steps and other measures taken by the central bank before deciding on the next steps. The next rate decision is scheduled for April 15.Bloomberg.com"

The average rate was 3.29 per cent, down from 3.45 per cent last week and the lowest in 49 years of data-keeping, Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday. The previous low, in November 2012, was 3.31 per cent. Plunging borrowing costs have set the stage for a spring housing boom and are giving homeowners a fresh opportunity to refinance into cheaper loans. Lenders are staffing up to meet the demand. Quicken Loans Inc., the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said Monday was the busiest day for mortgage applications in the company’s 35-year history. The spread of the virus has roiled financial markets, hammering stocks and pushing yields for the Treasuries that guide mortgage costs to the lowest on record. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point in its first emergency move since 2008. Mortgage rates will probably fall more and then hit a floor, said Matthew Pointon, U.S. property economist at Capital Economics Ltd. “I don’t think it’s going to go below three per cent,” he said. “Banks already have a surge in demand -- they don’t want to attract new customers.” At the current average rate, the monthly payment on a US$300,000, 30-year loan would be US$1,312.

The measure is expected to boost British Columbia’s personal income tax revenue by nearly 7 per cent in the next fiscal year after a projected 3 per cent decline this year, according to budget documents.“It’s my job to make sure that the benefits of B.C.’s strong economy are felt by everyone, not just the few at the top,” British Columbia Finance Minister Carole James said in Victoria. “Today we’re asking the people at the top, the highest 1 per cent of individual income earners, to pay a little more.”British Columbia Premier John Horgan has made affordability a central plank of his government since taking power in 2017.  Research has shown Vancouver — Canada’s priciest housing market — to be one of the continent’s most unaffordable housing markets with San Francisco-like home prices on Omaha-level incomes. In previous years, the provincial government’s measures have included levies targeting foreign buyers, properties left vacant for more than half the year, and a so-called school tax on luxury homes.In Tuesday’s budget announcement, the government forecast its surplus would widen to $227 million in the fiscal year beginning April 1, following a projected $203 million surplus in the year ending March 31. It projects a $179 million surplus in 2021-2022 and another $374 million surplus in 2022-23.British Columbia is expected to remain one of Canada’s fastest-growing provinces, the government said. The fiscal plan pegged economic growth at 2 per cent this year, following a 1.8 per cent expansion in 2019.“We all want to feel the benefits that come with a strong provincial economy,” James said. “We all want life to be more affordable.”The new tax bracket will mostly affect men: some 70 per cent of those set to pay the new top rate are male, the government said. Meanwhile, a rise in the minimum wage to more than $15 an hour by 2021 will disproportionately benefit women, James said. More than half of the province’s 140,000 minimum-wage earners are female, she said.More broadly, however, budget documents show overall wage growth slowing: average weekly wages in B.C. rose 2.5 per cent last year, down from a 4.1 per cent increase in 2018. The projections also indicate wage growth slowing this year and next.Meanwhile, the government’s efforts to drive down property prices have been only moderately successful. The average sale price of a home in British Columbia fell in 2019 by 1.6 per cent, according to budget documents, while housing activity is in an upward trajectory after bottoming out last year, according to TD Economics.Asked if she wants to see sharper declines, James answered, “I do.”Bloomberg.com"

Work began on an annualized 213,224 units in January, up 8.8 per cent from a revised 195,892 in the prior month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Monday in a statement. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had anticipated starts would be 205,000. It’s the highest level of new construction in four months, after a slowdown at the end of 2019, and suggests builders may be responding to the recovery in demand in some of the nation’s largest housing markets. At the same time demand is increasing, a shrinking supply of available homes is driving up prices in several cities. “With recent data pointing to further tightening in demand-supply conditions in many resale markets, a solid pace of home building to start the year will be welcomed,” Josh Nye, a senior economist at RBC Economics, said in a note to investors.  In a separate report Monday, Statistics Canada said building permits rose 7.4 per cent in December, more than double the 2.8 per cent median forecast from economists. The increase is consistent with the housing starts data for January, and included a 47 per cent surge in Toronto intentions, the most 2014. A combination of steady population growth, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs have brought buyers back into markets that had been lackluster for much of 2018 and early 2019. Combined with shrinking supply, the rising number of buyers has driven bids for homes higher in places like Toronto, where benchmark prices are up 9 per cent over the past year. Starts in Toronto were up 51 per cent from December, on a seasonally adjusted basis, CMHC said. Montreal, another market that has been doing well, saw starts rise 53 per cent. Overall, Canada recorded a 13.6 per cent jump in multiple urban starts during the month, while single-detached starts fell 0.9 per cent."
19,Bloomberg News,Nic Querolo and Olivia Rockeman,This could be America's priciest home ever — if it can find a buyer,America's priciest home is finally getting its finishing touches.,,,0,,2020-01-29,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/this-could-be-america-s-priciest-home-ever-if-it-can-find-a-buyer-1.1381367,,"America's priciest home is finally getting its finishing touches. Seven years after he started working on “The One,” a 100,000-square-foot mansion in Bel-Air, movie producer turned developer Nile Niami says he's just about ready to test the market with his ballyhooed US$500 million asking price. Replete with a nightclub, four swimming pools, bowling alley and 360-degree vistas of sun-dappled Southern California,  the symbol of America’s latest gilded age has generated a flood of media coverage since the proposed price was announced in 2015. And while permitting problems, construction delays and financing issues have exposed the struggles of building luxury homes on speculation, and raised questions about whether the project high above Los Angeles would ever be finished, Niami says he’s almost done.  And he’s not backing off the lofty price tag, which would make the house the most expensive in America. “When you have something that’s as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want for it,” Niami said in an interview, arguing that recent nine-figure property property deals in Los Angeles and elsewhere are proof that his pricing strategy was not just about generating press. “When the house was started, I had no basis to ask US$500 million— now there are so many triple-digit sales in L.A. and the world that the asking price is not unreasonable anymore.” Niami admits the pressure of his development odyssey has aged him prematurely.  Building mega-mansions without a buyer lined up can be precarious. Cost overruns and delays are common, carrying costs are high, and shifting appetites for luxury are hard to predict. And while a project as eye-popping as The One grabs headlines, the amenities and specific design can ultimately narrow the pool of potential buyers, said appraiser Jonathan Miller, president of the real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel Inc. “The problem is, the more amenities you add, the more you personalize the property,’’ Miller said. “Even though the intention is to draw eyeballs to the property, you are also personalizing it, which may reduce the size of the market pie. It’s a very small, very tight market.” Niami says that’s not a problem. Los Angeles has tried to limit  the construction of new mega-mansions, meaning nothing like The One can be built again, the developer said. And while one amenity that got a lot of attention — a room with tanks of live jellyfish lining the walls — has been dropped because it was too much work, Niami said he’s got something planned that’s  “even better.’’He hasn’t yet let anyone inside the property, but says the special features have helped draw interest from potential buyers. He’s talking to them now, but declined to provide details, citing privacy issues. The One’s unveiling will happen once the final interior decorating is done, Niami said. “I’ve had potential buyers a long time on this,’’ Niami said. “We have a list of very real, verifiable buyers that we will bring in soon.” Pricing homes above their market value, a strategy known as “aspirational pricing,” is a way for a developer to get attention for ultra-luxury listings.  A sale at the half-billion-dollar asking price would be more than double the biggest residential real estate deal in the U.S. to date -- a $238  million penthouse purchased by Citadel founder Ken Griffin in Manhattan. Niami points out that Griffin’s place is an apartment, with no land, while The One sits on 3 acres. “The Billionaire,” another Bel-Air spec house that briefly was the most-expensive home for sale in America, was originally listed by developer Bruce Makowsky for $250 million. The 38,000-square-foot mansion, with wine cellars, pools, a bowling alley, helipad and “candy room,” sold for $94 million in October, a 62% price cut. A Los Angeles native raised by a single mother who was  a special education teacher, Niami started out as a makeup artist in the move industry.  He eventually became a producer and his credits include “The Patriot,” starring Steven Seagal, and “Point Blank,” with Mickey Rourke. His turn to real estate came when he began remodeling condos.  Niami has two additional multimillion-dollar projects in Bel-Air. On a neighboring hillside, another of his properties, 10701 Bellagio Road, took three price cuts after being listed in 2018 for $65 million. A notice of intent to revoke permits on that property, and on another US$65 million Niami-owned mansion directly behind it, were issued by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. “When you have something as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want” Without those permits, the properties can’t be legally occupied.  After several meetings, the issues are close to being resolved, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. Still, the properties have been taken off the market, he said. That leaves The One. Niami took out a two-year US$82.5 million loan from Hankey Capital, which specializes in high-interest bridge financing, to help finish the construction. He's current on the debt payments and faces an October deadline to repay the money, according to Hankey. Niami declined to comment on the rate of his loan. While very few super-luxury homes sell each year, there was an uptick in 2019. Last year, 23 homes went for US$50 million or more in the U.S., the most since 2014, according to Miller. Six of those sold for at least US$100 million.“The One is absolutely no issue,” Niami said.  “The value is definitely there.” --With assistance from Edvard Pettersson and Hailey Waller."

Prices continued to march higher, with the national benchmark price index rising 0.8 per cent in December to bring gains over the past six months to 4.3 per cent.

Sales in Toronto dropped three per cent in December, with new listings in that market down 5.7 per cent. The city was easily the biggest contributor to the drop in transactions, along with Ottawa.

In the three months through November, purchases averaged a 720,000 pace, the strongest in 12 years. Key Insights • Increased demand for new homes is being fueled by historically cheap borrowing costs, the lowest jobless rate since the 1960s and stronger income growth. The strength in housing should continue to fuel gains in residential construction, a direct input into the government’s calculation of gross domestic product. • At the same time, low supplies continue to put upward pressure on prices, offsetting some of the boost in affordability from low interest rates and wage gains. The median sales price of a new home increased 7.2 per cent from a year earlier to US$330,800 in November. • Following a separate report Monday showing a slight gain in core capital goods orders, the home-sales figures underscore consumer-led economic growth as business-investment cutbacks restrain manufacturing. • Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the market, declined in November as lean inventory continued to restrain an industry with otherwise solid growth. New-home sales are considered a timelier barometer than those of previously- owned homes, which are calculated when contracts close. Get More • Purchases of new homes rose in two of four U.S. regions, led by a 52.4% surge in the Northeast and a 7.5% gain in the West, which recorded its highest sales level in two years. • Economists in Bloomberg's survey projected an annualized pace of 732,000 new-home sales for November after a previously reported 733,000 a month earlier. Estimates ranged from 696,000 to 765,000. • The supply of homes at the current sales rate dropped to 5.4 months from 5.5 months in November. The number of new homes for sale held at 323,000. • The number of properties sold for which construction hadn’t yet started increased, while the number of partially built dwellings climbed to the highest level since July 2016. The figures indicate a robust pipeline for homebuilders. • Changes in the seasonally adjusted data are volatile and have a wide margin of error. There’s a 90 per cent chance that the monthly percentage change was between a 9.7 per cent decline and a 12.3 per cent increase, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

He called his time at the bank, which began in 2013, “the most fulfilling of my long career.”Even after recent interest rate increases, borrowing costs were kept lower near the lowest levels under his watch than at any time in the central bank’s 80-year history. That ultimately kept the economy afloat long enough to oversee one of the fastest increases in jobs and probably the largest accumulation of wealth in the nation’s history, as cheap money inflated the value of real estate and financial assets.But Poloz’s efforts to return the economy to full health — where it’s not reliant on low interest rates, housing and debt — ultimately fell short as Canada grappled with the lingering effects of the last recession and wrestled with a litany of new headwinds including a once-in-a-generation collapse in commodity prices and the impacts of global trade tensions.Bloomberg.com"

Financial Services Authority, which currently regulates mortgage brokers, private pension plans and financial institutions. Having a single regulator for those areas will streamline investigations and enforcement, according to the government.British Columbia has led Canada’s charge against spiralling home costs, introducing new taxes and policies to restrict foreign investment and speculation. In 2016, it ended self-regulation of the real estate industry after a scandal involving “shadow flipping,” where brokers earn multiple commissions by helping properties trade hands repeatedly before a deal closes, inflating prices. The province also is set to become the world’s first jurisdiction to expose hidden property owners next year when it creates a searchable, public registry of who controls the trusts and anonymous corporations that own land.Vancouver, in particular, has come under scrutiny after the government revealed that casinos had been accepting millions of dollars in questionable cash from gamblers for years. The Pacific Coast city is one the continent’s most unaffordable housing markets after prices more than doubled in a decade.Premier John Horgan’s government has partly blamed dirty money, issuing a government-funded report earlier this year that claimed more than $7 billion (US$5.3 billion) was washed through the province in a year. Questions remain about those figures, which were derived from economic modelling, not hard evidence.

Despite hogging all the headlines, prices of residential property in Canada’s most populous city trailed that with a 127 per cent increase, according to the Teranet-National Bank Home Price Index.It’s clear either of those investments have delivered a tidy return but there’s one group of investors who have done exponentially better: those who bet on the equity version of real estate.The S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index has risen 354 per cent, dividends included, since the end of 2008 and the S&P/TSX Composite Real Estate Index, made up of real estate income trusts and other companies in the industry gained 262 per cent.“You don’t have to worry about things like actual maintenance and keeping the property lease up,” said Jenny Ma, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “And also you get the diversification of many properties, across different markets and potentially across different asset types as well.”Liquidity is also key. “You buy and sell REITs like you do any stock on the exchange rather than actually buying and selling properties themselves, which take a lot more time and also have a lot of transaction costs involved,” Ma said.To be sure, investing in Canada’s stock market has had its ups and downs with concerns surrounding global economic growth, the U.S.-China trade war and the boom (and bust) of commodity prices.So which investment is more risky?“Stocks likely have more short-term volatility than home prices, but home prices may be a bit more vulnerable to change in tastes, as well as prolonged periods of under-performance,” said Douglas Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, adding real estate is clearly a less liquid market.Holding costs are much higher in the world of real estate when you add in property taxes, maintenance costs and other expenses. Meanwhile fees are being reduced or eliminated for many stock-market products.“Overall, it’s actually quite difficult to properly evaluate real estate returns to equity market returns.

Sometimes, they pull up in shiny pickups purchased just a year or two ago.“You never know who’s going to walk through your door,” said Edwards, the food bank’s director. “Individuals that have degrees and education and skills — but the jobs just aren’t what they were.”Once the booming heart of the country’s energy industry, the little city of 75,000 in northeastern Alberta has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing.

What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oilsands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oilsands as a “carbon bomb” that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.Stewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada’s federal election later this month.

The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta’s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.In May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.’s Fort Hills oilsands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.Richardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He’d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.After the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he’s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as cancelling his family’s cable subscription.“I spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,” Richardson, 42, said. He’s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. “I never got into all the toys. I’m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn’t have to sell everything off like some other people. I’ve seen a lot of that. It’s like a fire sale.”The energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It’s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.The potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oilsands are the world’s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested $210.1 billion (US$157.7 billion), more than last year’s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day. Canada shot up from the world’s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest, overtaking Iran, Mexico and Norway.It was a heady time.Tax revenue and corporate sponsorships paid for a revamp of the Fort McMurray International Airport, improvements to schools, top-notch hockey facilities and a gleaming new recreation centre, where Carrie Underwood was a recent headliner.The city’s population doubled as workers crowded in from around the country, sending rents and home prices surging and prompting a cascade of typical boomtown challenges, from crazy traffic to crowded schools. Companies, desperate for labour, threw six-figure salaries at low-skill jobs and covered commuting costs for roughnecks and people from as far away as Canada’s Atlantic Coast. Median annual household incomes more than doubled from 2001 to 2011, to about $181,000.Then oil prices tanked. The pipeline plans stalled. International giants, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sold off their major oilsands assets. Capital investments are on track to decline for a fifth straight year to an estimated $12 billion this year, about one-third of the 2014 level, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.Several operators — Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and a few others — are still active and generally profitable. But they’ve managed that by cutting costs, including, of course, that of labour.“People aren’t getting the overtime that they used to get, or they’re not getting any overtime at all,” said Sandra Landry, an insolvency trustee at MNP Ltd.If things weren’t bad enough when oil bottomed around US$26 a barrel in early 2016, the largest wildfire in recent history swept through the Fort Mac area that May. It forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses, making it the country’s costliest natural disaster.“The housing market is down, there’s the economic downturn and there’s still the recovery from the fire,” said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. Home prices remain 44 per cent below the recent peak.Sean O’Byrne moved to Fort Mac from Grande Prairie, Alberta, after the fire to open a branch of a friend’s siding business to repair damaged houses. That work dried up in November. Now he’s selling cars, making far less than the $1,000 a day he could rake in with the siding business; customers at the General Motors dealership are no longer trading in for new models every two years. He and his wife have cut back on travel and moved to a cheaper apartment closer to their children’s school, saving $900 in rent, he said while sipping coffee in a Tim Hortons doughnut shop facing a forested area, where charred trees stick out among new growth.“People aren’t spending money like they used to,” he said.They likely won’t be in the near future. There are only a few projects on the horizon that would create many new jobs. Teck Resources Ltd.’s proposed $20-billion Frontier mine is in the early stages of the regulatory-approval process. Imperial Oil Ltd., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., has put its long-planned $2.6-billion Aspen mine on hold, waiting to see if the pipeline situation improves.There aren’t many bets being laid that it will. More than a few folks would rather it not. Since the frenzy died down, traffic has returned to normal, in part because the oil money helped build a new bridge, over the Athabasca river. The unemployment rate, which skyrocketed to around 10 per cent in 2016, has settled down to 6.3 per cent mostly a function of workers decamping for more promising prospects.“That massive boom and gold-rush mentality that took place — I would rather not relive that,” said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus, adding the entire industry has learned the benefits of measured growth.These days, the company will only consider expansion projects that will be profitable with the benchmark U.S. oil price at US$45 a barrel, about US$10 less than the current level. Some oilsands projects undertaken a decade ago required US$100 a barrel to break even.John Hickey is also content with the slowdown. A mechanic who works on used oil-industry vehicles, he lost his house in the wildfire. Two years ago, a builder quoted him $500,000. The offers keep moving down, and he’s waiting for one to get to $200,000 or so before going ahead.In the meantime, he’s sharing a one-bedroom condo with a friend, sleeping in a tent in the living room to give himself a bit of privacy. He still has work and has always lived within his means, a lesson for places like Fort Mac that can see the money go as quickly as it came, he said.Too many, he said, “made a lifestyle based on an economy that wasn’t sustainable.”Bloomberg.com"

Four years later, she’s considering his rival.“We’re getting to the time that we have to go Conservative,” Khoda said after attending a boisterous all-candidates debate at a community centre in Richmond Hill, Ontario, a city just north of Toronto. “The Liberals are going to lose seats.”Like Ohio in the U.S., the sprawling suburbs around Toronto will likely dictate who will win the Oct. 21 election. After sweeping the diverse, immigrant-rich region four years ago, the Liberals are facing a difficult battle against Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer in the bellwether region known for its 905 area code.While polls tip Trudeau to win the most seats, his party is riding neck and neck with the Conservatives in the popular vote. If the Liberals sink to a minority government, or lose the election, chances are it will be because Trudeau lost support in this key area over his handling of foreign policy issues such as Iran and China, and the soaring cost of living.Khoda came to the evening debate seeking answers from Liberal incumbent Majid Jowhari on his position of resuming ties with Iran — a country she fled 33 years ago — even though she has made her choice. The Liberals’ views on Iran, and “upsetting” efforts dealing with the U.S. on trade, led her to switch support to Conservative candidate Costas Menegakis.Others packing the gym suggest a close two-way battle between the Liberals and Conservatives in a riding pollsters say favours the incumbents.“I think Majid Jowhari has a good chance,” said Mohammad Mahmoudzadeh, 66, chairman of a local construction firm, though he no longer expects the Liberals to win a majority government.The Richmond Hill riding has about 110,000 people with a median total household income of $73,563 (US$55,245), similar to Ontario’s provincial average. Three out of every five people here are immigrants, of which 72 per cent are from Asia — led by China, Iran and Hong Kong, according to the country’s statistics agency. Almost two thirds of the population view themselves as “first generation” Canadians.Richmond Hill is one of 25 ridings in the 905 that includes the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan and Markham. They’re family-oriented communities whose homeowners carry large mortgages, leaving little left over for spending elsewhere and often commute to Toronto for work, where lack of public transit is a perennial complaint.“This is a community that’s been really hampered in its growth by the lack of a subway station,” said Karen Mortfield, executive director of the Richmond Hill Board of Trade, which hosted the debate. “That’s a big deal.”In 2015, the Liberals captured all of Toronto’s 25 ridings and all but three of the suburban districts, helping Trudeau win a majority government with 184 of the 338 seats in Parliament. But the seats often flip. In 2011, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives captured most of the suburbs and parts of Toronto to gain a majority. The two regions together make up 50 seats, accounting for 15 per cent of the entire country.“Since the early 1960s the suburban belt around Toronto has determined which party comes to power and whether it’s going to be a majority or minority,” Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor who specializes in Canadian politics, said in a phone interview. “And in this election, the Liberals are going to sustain significant losses — they might lose half of those seats.”Winning this region involves swinging votes by a couple percentage points and the Liberals are playing defence versus 2015, when Trudeau’s “Sunny Ways” mantra of hope appealed to Canadians wanting change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Wiseman said. He anticipates lower voter turnout this time, especially among younger Canadians, which favours the Conservatives since they tend to gain the older vote.The Liberals have 36 per cent support compared to 35 per cent for the Conservatives, while the New Democratic Party is third with 13 per cent, according to a Nanos Research survey published Wednesday by CTV News and the Globe and Mail. Seat projections compiled by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. put Trudeau on track to win in 153 districts, short of the 170 required for a majority.At Hillcrest Mall, one of Richmond Hill’s biggest shopping centres, voters were divided. For Soroush Yousefi, 23, voting Conservative is a no-brainer even though he backed Trudeau four years earlier. Scheer’s tax cuts and promises to boost the economy.“Back then, a lot of the things Trudeau promised seemed better, but since he’s been in power, everything has been going downhill,” said Yousefi, a sales associate, who points to the lofty cost of housing. “Everything just keeps getting more and more expensive and the jobs aren’t paying enough to keep up with your expenses.”A few stores away, employee Emma Hamilton said she’s probably voting Liberal.“I’ve been working 40 hours the entire summer each week just to save up for school so my biggest concern is everybody’s stance toward education and I don’t like the direction the Conservatives are going,” Hamilton, 20, said while closing shop after a late weeknight shift. “I feel like Trudeau’s all talk as well, so I’d like to vote NDP, but they never win.”No one at the mall or community centre took issue with Trudeau’s blackface controversy, photos of him in dark make up as a younger man, released earlier in the campaign.Even Richmond Hill’s mayor wouldn’t predict the outcome of the federal contest in his backyard during an Oct. 2 phone interview.“It’ll be very close and it might end up being a party where the two governments have to work together,” Mayor Dave Barrow said.Bloomberg.com"
44,Bloomberg News,Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg,"From childcare to transit, Canadian voters are feeling pinched","Canada’s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters.",,,0,,2019-10-04,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/from-childcare-to-transit-canadian-voters-are-feeling-pinched-1.1326491,,"Canada’s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters. Though broad economic data show the nation’s economy is humming along, Canadians are still feeling tight on cash. The worsening global outlook and unprecedented policy uncertainty are adding to the apprehension. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with the leaders of smaller parties are seeking to parlay that stress into votes as the clock winds down on the Oct. 21 election, by promising a slew of tax cuts and other measures to make life more affordable for Canadians. “Politicians are putting their finger on something, some form of financial anxiety about rising costs, or concerns about future rising costs, or future standard of living,” said Jennifer Robson, associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa. Here’s why consumers are feeling pinched.  It’s old news that owning a home in Canada’s biggest cities has become an almost impossible goal for much of the middle class. Skyrocketing prices in recent years pushed potential buyers to the sidelines. New mortgage lending rules, so-called stress tests introduced by federal regulators in 2017, put ownership even further out of reach for many. Toronto and Vancouver are easily Canada’s two main cities where residents are struggling to find an affordable place to live. The average selling price for a single family home in Vancouver was $1.51 million in September, and $1.1 million in Toronto. Renting in those cities is no easy feat either as low vacancy rates have pushed up prices for accommodation.  Elevated real estate prices are the main driver of the country’s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. Buyers took out larger and larger mortgages as the housing market heated up, even as incomes failed to keep pace. As a result, household savings rates are hovering near the lowest in decades and the debt service ratio -- which measures the share of disposable income paid toward principal and interest -- climbed to a record in the second quarter.  While overall price inflation in Canada has been relatively benign, shoppers have experienced sticker shock on many basics. Prices for fruits and vegetables jumped as much as 60 per cent in the past decade, according to Statistics Canada. Childcare and tuition costs rose upwards of 35 per cent and public transit prices ballooned by 50 per cent.  To top it all off, wages after accounting for inflation have remained relatively flat, even as costs for rent and basic goods increased. A puzzle for many economists and policy makers is why unemployment is hovering near record lows, yet incomes are struggling to pick up. ‘Arms Race’ The financial pressure on Canadians isn’t likely to ease anytime soon, with the worldwide economic outlook dimming. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to 3.2 per cent. A rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009. Adding to the tension, many workers are worried about robots displacing jobs and the financial impact of an aging population. “That’s the emotional side of this issue that doesn’t show up in any CPI index or economic data,” said David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus Data. “It’s in the head and the parties are clearly recognizing that emotional side is important. It’s like an arms race right now in Canada to offer up who can save us the most money.”"

There hadn’t been a non-prime RMBS since Xceed Mortgage Trust in March 2007.Home Capital is turning to the securitization market at a time when it doesn’t have any senior unsecured bonds outstanding, said Kotush. The company, which came close to collapse in 2017, is focused on re-gaining its investment grade rating, he said. Home Trust is rated BB+ by S&P Global while Home Capital is rated BB-, both below investment grade.The alternative lender was bailed out by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. after it was found by regulators to have improperly disclosed falsified home-loan applications and short-sellers targeted the stock. Berkshire has since cashed in as the stock has recovered, with its stake falling to about 4.7 per cent from 20 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The shares closed up 3.4 per cent at $25.15 in Toronto, bringing gains to 75 per cent this year and making it the best-performing stock in the S&P/TSX Composite Financials Index.Home Capital priced the top rated securities with an expected average life of 2.38 years with a spread of 145 basis points over Canadian treasury bonds, Bloomberg data show. Equitable Bank, a lender rated at second-lowest investment grade priced three-year senior unsecured deposit notes on Monday at the same spread, according to people familiar with the matter.Bloomberg.com"

A strong run of economic data affords policy makers opportunity to resist — as they have so far — the dovish turn in global policy. But escalating tensions between China and the U.S., and their spillover into Canada, are getting tougher to overlook, particularly given how they’ve already become a major reason behind global factory weakness.“The truth of the matter is, if you go back really over the last month and a half, the domestic picture hasn’t change in Canada,” said Mark Chandler, head of fixed-income research at Royal Bank of Canada, who sees a rate cut in January. “Trade risks have increased but we really don’t know at this stage to what degree they’ve altered the outlook for the bank.”Complicating matters is that the Bank of Canada hasn’t made any public comments since its last rate decision on July 10. Wednesday’s decision is a statement-only affair. The next day, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will give a speech in Halifax to provide more details on the central bank’s deliberations around the decision.Swaps trading suggests investors are fully pricing in a cut by December, with strong odds of a second by this time next year. Odds for a rate cut on Wednesday are less than 10 per cent.Even two cuts over the next 12 months would still leave Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies — raising the question of whether the domestic outlook truly justifies the northern nation’s outlier status.While Canada’s expansion is hardly remarkable, it stands out by virtue of having largely weathered the recent global slowdown. After a sluggish start to the year, growth in Canada accelerated to a strong 3.7 per cent annualized pace in the second quarter, giving it a very decent 2.1 per cent performance for the first half.Canada’s housing market, meanwhile, is recovering; inflation is at target; and wage gains are accelerating. The Canadian data are hardly screaming rate cut.Nor are forecasts overly gloomy.Economists, including those at the central bank, continue to see growth averaging more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, which outside of the U.S. is as good as it gets in the Group of Seven.Of course, the Bank of Canada could mark down its forecasts for exports and investment, and the second-quarter GDP numbers also raised concerns about the underlying strength of consumption. But without a global recession, the base case will continue to call for half-decent growth, tempering the need for rate cuts.Yet, the one thing Poloz has practiced as governor is a reluctance to put too much weight on base case projections. He adopted a risk management framework in 2013 — well before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — that essentially moved the focus away from pinpoint forecasts to thinking about what could produce unexpected deviations. It’s a play-it-safe strategy.When conditions were calling for rates to go up, risk management took the form of hyper data dependency. Policy makers were worried that more expensive credit could trigger an unwanted downturn so they were willing to go slow with hikes, waiting for the data to reaffirm their analysis.Now, with downside risks at the forefront and conditions suggesting cuts are in order, waiting may no longer be the best type of risk management strategy. Which is why Poloz, in the middle of the oil price shock in 2015, cut interest rates at the time. He called it an insurance cut, much like Powell’s rationale for the Fed’s last move.Bloomberg.com"

That still beat the median forecast of 202,000 units in a Bloomberg survey. Multiple unit starts fell 12 per cent, the agency said, while construction of single-detached houses was down 1.6 per cent.The “national trend” in housing starts increased in July, in spite of the decrease in the adjusted level, said Bob Dugan, CMHC’s chief economist. “High levels of activity in apartment and row starts in urban centres in recent months continued to be reflected in the high level of the total starts trend in July,” he said in a statement.The July numbers were “less of a reversal than we thought” after the surge in June, Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. The average of 208,000 so far this year represents elevated demographic demand.“Residential construction activity remains rock solid in Canada and, combined with firming resale activity, will be something for the Bank of Canada to keep in mind,” Porter said.Canada’s real estate market is stabilizing after steep declines in 2018 that lingered into the first quarter. That’s been helped by stronger economic growth and declining borrowing costs.

He argues lower interest rates, an accelerating housing market, a solid labour market, record high stocks and overall decent investment returns will support consumption.“We’re probably going to see a pick up in big ticket items again,” Demers said in a phone interview. “It’s not great because we’re relying on debt, but in terms of dynamics, it looks more positive over the next 12 to 18 months in an environment where rates are going down, and not up.”Home sales skidded to their lowest since 2012 last year as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market. Automobile sales also suffered in Canada, with 2018 marking the first annual drop since the last recession. The malaise has been reflected in the pace of household credit growth, which has slowed to a crawl: It rose just 3.4 per cent in May, the weakest annual pace since 1983.But the Canadian housing market — east of Manitoba, at least — is already showing signs of shaking off that weakness.

In addition, the 11.5 per cent increase in resale volumes in the GTA signals “very strong,” demand, Demers said.“The soft landing is behind us,” he added. “When you think about the GTA and Canada in general, we’re looking more at a re-acceleration.”The high household debt level “remains a big concern and a headwind to the Canadian dollar,” said Demers, and without a strong capital spending boom, the lingering debt burden will mean it’s tough to “outperform trend growth” once rates eventually move higher, constraining disposable income.In the shorter term, however, Demers is more bullish on Canada, partly because the country’s equity market may be less exposed to trade-war uncertainty. He sees car sales stabilizing this summer, and the housing market in central Canada continuing to accelerate. Gross domestic product for May on Wednesday will give an indication of whether the country’s economic upswing remains on track.“The pace of credit growth should pick up in the second half of this year,” as more “trend-like” household spending returns, Demers said. “This removes a lot of the downside risks regarding households we saw earlier this year.”Consumer confidence highest in a year and a halfOne more reason to believe big-ticket spending is set for a rebound is the recent surge in consumer confidence measures, which are closely tied to the state of the economy and moves in stock markets. The Bloomberg Nanos economic mood index reached 59.06 this month, the highest level in a year and a half. Periods of elevated consumer confidence tend to coincide with increases in home and vehicle sales.The fear of missing out is also fuelling the nation’s debt habit.40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they're spending more than they earnA survey by Manulife Bank of Canada found almost 40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they’re spending more than they earn, and 12 per cent attribute the imbalance to an excess of costly outings with friends or family.A lot of that has to do with the pressure of social media, according to Rick Lunny, the bank’s chief executive officer, who says especially for younger people who haven’t had time to build savings, the rising cost of housing and child care leaves little to spend on entertainment.“Everybody’s on social media,” Lunny said by phone. “Everybody seems to have a better life than you. So you have this fear of missing out and you only live once attitude, but that’s a very expensive lifestyle when you can’t afford it.”Bloomberg.com"

The development, called Union Park, is the largest ever for Oxford outside of Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, the $25 billion project it’s co-developing with Related Cos.Plans call for two office towers, of 58 and 48 stories, about 800 rental apartments across two buildings and 200,000 square feet for retail. Three acres will be devoted to public space, including an urban park over the Union Station rail corridor, which spans Blue Jays Way to the John Street Bridge.“It’s the culmination of our experience in a number of different cities, and we’ve looked at what we’ve done, whether in Europe or in the U.S. with Hudson Yards,” Eric Plesman, Oxford’s executive vice president of North America, said in an interview. “This is a site that’s exceptionally significant, and it’s rare that you can find this size of site with proximity to the core.”The project is a big bet on increasing demand for offices from the city’s booming technology and financial-services industries, and the shift to downtown from the suburbs. The Union Park site lies between the space-crunched financial core, and The Well, a mixed-use development that will be home to Shopify Inc. and hundreds of new residents.Toronto is in the midst of a construction boom. In addition to Oxford’s project and The Well, which will have three million square-feet of retail, office and residential space, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. and Hines are developing CIBC SQUARE. That will comprise two commercial towers spanning 3 million square feet that will house offices for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as well as Microsoft Inc. Cadillac Fairview Corp. and Investment Management Corp. of Ontario are also developing 1.2 million-plus square feet of office and retail space.In a bid to attract global tech giants or other major tenants, Oxford has plans for 100,000-square-foot spaces that would be split between the office towers and connected by a common atrium, said Mark Cote, head of development. One company would be able to occupy the whole space.“We want to create a commercial campus opportunity for large office users,” Cote said.About 18,000 people will work at Union Park, and the development itself could create 22,000 construction jobs, Oxford said. The firm’s application will include an expansion of the PATH network, an underground connection to Toronto’s financial core. Larger RentalsAs for the housing portion, Oxford will focus on larger rentals units ranging from one- to three-bedrooms, given the short supply downtown for families.“It’s an under-serviced part of the market,” Cote said. “300-square-foot units, I mean, it’s hard to raise a family in those apartments.”Oxford aims to start construction in 2023, pending the needed municipal approvals, said Carlo Timpano, vice president of development.Oxford is renewing its portfolio, selling assets such as an office tower in downtown Montreal and a stake in iconic hotels in Western Canada while developing 14 projects in the country.“We intend on continuing to build within Canada: we’ve seen our capital grow almost 35 per cent over the last five years by $7.5 billion in Canada and a lot of that growth has been in our development pipeline,” Plesman said.Bloomberg.com"
146,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Chris Fournier,Three reasons Canadians will feel the pain of the next recession more than Americans,Signs that financial strains are higher here in Canada,,,0,,2019-06-10,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/why-the-next-recession-will-hit-canadians-harder-than-americans?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/toronto-1.jpg,"The recent yield curve inversion has renewed speculation about a potential North American recession and prompted questions about how a contraction would affect households.Though it’s impossible to say for certain when, or even if, such an event will occur, several indicators suggest the pain would be more severe on the Canadian side of the border than in the U.S.Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., which oversees $430 billion, says while he doesn’t see signs of a debt crisis in the making, Canada’s households are clearly more stretched in terms of debt and spending than their American counterparts.“There’s just no latent capacity to spend or to buffer a shock in Canada, and the U.S. is very well positioned,” Lascelles said by phone from Toronto. “You could lose your job and you would be okay in the U.S., or rates could go up and you’d be fine, or the economy could turn down and spending could continue. In Canada, you can’t really say that.”Here are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada — and one that shows why the country’s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada’s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. “That’s about as low as it gets, historically,” said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn’t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.“If there were to be a recession, whether it’s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,” Lascelles said in a separate webcast. “They just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.”Canada’s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada’s households are “substantially more leveraged” than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.In Canada, the debt service ratio — the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt — climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. “It’s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,” Lascelles said. “That’s a concern.”Because the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.“It doesn’t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,” Lascelles said. “The vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It’s not whether you have a lot of debt, it’s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada’s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.”If the housing market implodes — which Lascelles isn’t expecting — it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. “And so to the extent we haven’t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren’t as many households that are vulnerable.”He added: “It’s not obvious there’s a debt crisis in the making though. It’s just one that’s going to limit consumer spending and limit the economy more generally.”Bloomberg.com"

While thousands of properties were flagged as suspect, almost all fell short of clear criminal links.Save one, according to the probe’s final report. “Most astonishingly,” Attorney General David Eby declared at a press conference when it was presented, “a $3.5 million Gulf Island property acquired with funds allegedly embezzled from a $90 million loan fraud in India.”It appears the government jumped the gun on that, too. There’s little evidence to show the mansion was bought with criminal proceeds — it was purchased by an Indian entrepreneur long before he faced the accusations of fraud.The tenuous link is the latest misstep by the provincial government after multi-billion dollar laundering estimates it presented that same day failed to hold up to scrutiny. Premier John Horgan is under pressure to deliver answers to a public outraged that the cost of a typical Vancouver home has surpassed $1 million. He’s blamed the price surge on what he’s called “unchecked” fraud and launched a formal inquiry into money laundering in a bid to cool the market.The probe shows that proving ties to criminal activity isn’t so easy. A trail of documents reveals that the property’s been linked since 2005 to a flamboyant Indian-born telecom tycoon, Chinnakannan Sivasankaran, who transferred its ownership while subject to an asset freeze as creditors chased him through courts in the U.K., India and the Seychelles.Sivasankaran declined to be interviewed for this story or to respond to the B.C. claims the property may have been purchased with embezzled funds. He also declined to answer questions about whether he intended to use the property to settle some of his companies’ debts.The property in question is a timber-and-glass cabin perched in a 26-acre wooded estate with views stretching to Mt. Baker in Washington state. It sits on the southern tip of Salt Spring Island, a halcyon haven of hippies, retirees and vacation homes often owned by wealthy Americans. Land title records list the owner as Axcel Sunshine Ltd. — a British Virgin Islands-based shell that Indian investigators say is controlled by Sivasankaran and was used in an alleged fraud at Mumbai-based IDBI Bank Ltd.According to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation and U.K. court filings, Sivasankaran and his deputies allegedly conspired with former IDBI executives to obtain an $83 million credit facility for Axcel in 2014 in order to pay off loans to other Siva Group companies that had soured — a practice known as “evergreening” that’s been common among Indian banks holding the world’s worst bad-loan ratio. Within that ignominious group, IDBI has the worst bad-loan ratio.Of the US$67 million that was actually disbursed to Axcel, the full amount has been accounted for — it was used to clear the dues of six Siva Group companies, according to the CBI. In other words, that money doesn’t appear to have ended up in Salt Spring, despite the claims by the B.C. government. Sivasankaran had already bought the property long before the alleged mischief at IDBI and when his star was still rising.Sivasankaran built a fortune starting in the 1980s by anticipating the wants of India’s aspirational consumers: cut-rate personal computers, mobile phones, a Starbucks-copycat named Barista. Siva Group, the sprawling conglomerate he founded, claimed annual revenues of US$3 billion at one point. When he purchased the Canadian property through a unit in 2005, the tycoon was on the cusp of clinching a mega deal — the sale of Indian mobile carrier Aircel Ltd. to one of Malaysia’s richest men for about US$1 billion.As his wealth grew, so did his taste for the finer things in life: gold Rolexes, presidential suites at the Ritz-Carlton, and at least three private planes, according to a 2014 Business Standard profile. The Salt Spring estate is decidedly modest compared with his other real estate sprees like the “Hammer Time” mansion in California — a 40,000-square-foot enormity with gold-plated gates and a 17-car garage that he bought from M.C. Hammer when the rapper could no longer afford to keep it.“A first-class flight is still public transport,” Sivasankaran told Singapore’s The New Paper in 2008 after paying US$1 million for a year’s membership in an elite club to supplement his transport, with four jets and two yachts as “back up.”If the 62-year-old mogul had intended to hide some of his vast wealth, he would’ve found few places as welcoming as Canada. The country has long accepted cash of unknown origin from around the world with few questions asked and guarded the anonymity of owners as tightly as any tax haven, while lending transactions a veneer of respectability — a process quaintly referred to in international law enforcement circles as “snow washing.”Sivasankaran — better known as Siva — didn’t take full advantage of Canada’s veil of secrecy. He used an eponymous Bermuda-registered shell Siva Ltd. to buy the property for $3.6 million in 2005, according to B.C. property records. His name and signature appear in land title documents nearly a decade later when the residence was transferred to Axcel.Sivasankaran has proved slippery in the past: Bahraini telecom operator Batelco spent years chasing him through courts in the U.K., India and the Seychelles — where at some point he’d become a citizen — to pay a claim related to a failed joint venture.A London court placed a worldwide freeze order on Sivasankaran and Siva Ltd.’s assets in July 2014. In an apparent violation of that order, within days, Sivasankaran had listed the Salt Spring property for sale and transferred it in a private transaction to Axcel, according to B.C. property records.It's like clockwork. They think it's the end of the earth out here.The property has been put on the market at least three times since 2011 for about $7 million. It’s never sold.Meanwhile, the head-scratching case involving the Indian bank drags on. IDBI filed an US$86 million claim against Axcel, which failed to repay the loan used to pay off the other Siva Group dues. Axcel has acknowledged it owes the amount, but its lawyers told the court that “our client does not have the assets and/or resources to meet the payments due.”“As the proceedings have not concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment or verify your query in relation to a property in Canada,” Scarmans, the law firm representing Axcel and another Siva Group company that backed its loan, said in a letter. “Both companies have confirmed to us, as a result of your enquiry, that they are unaware of any money laundering investigation in Canada or otherwise.”IDBI’s U.K. lawyers 4 Pump Court and TLT LLP, and the office of the B.C. attorney general declined comment.Wild deer graze outside the Salt Spring estate as the peal of an unanswered doorbell echoes through the woods. Whether the property is ever used is anyone’s guess — there’s no neighbouring home within sight.It won’t go down as one of the better investments by a dealmaker once known as one of India’s shrewdest. The estate is currently assessed at $3.8 million — adjusted for inflation, less than what Siva Ltd. paid for it 14 years ago. It’s an ironic twist given that the money laundering probe which singled out his property was prompted by outrage at the rapid escalation in real estate prices in the province.Scott Simmons, a realtor on Salt Spring, reckons it might sell for about $3 million. He’s never heard of Sivasankaran and is dubious that a flood of dirty money has really fuelled housing prices. That said, during his two decades there as a realtor, every so often the police seem to swoop in and nab white-collar crime suspects on the sleepy island, he says.“It’s like clockwork,” he says. “They think it’s the end of the earth out here.”Bloomberg.com"

A closer reading of the studies underlying the announcement shows there’s little hard evidence of actual money laundering, and even then, the amounts could be much smaller. And while one report said much of the suspect money is coming from China, the other pointed to the U.S.“It’s very difficult for us to really accurately estimate the volume of flows of money laundering,” said Vanessa Iafolla, who researches money laundering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “It’s hard to measure something that you can’t see.”Canada’s third-largest city and its most expensive housing market is increasingly divided over what caused the cost of a typical home to surpass a million dollars in mid-2017. Premier John Horgan’s government, which has pledged to make housing more affordable, is under pressure to deliver answers. He announced Wednesday a formal inquiry into money laundering.The province is planning to set up a public registry of beneficial property owners by next year — the single most important step in peeling back the anonymity that enables dirty money, many experts agree. In the meantime, it’s working with educated guesstimates.The study gauged that $7.4 billion was laundered through B.C. last year. By far the biggest source of dirty cash into Canada was the U.S. at $4.9 billion, six times more than from East Asia, including China. The second study, led by a former police chief, said it identified thousands of suspect properties — none of which were used to arrive at the $7 billion figure — and declared that “China figures prominently” in the flow of suspicious money.The methodology in the first study, known as the gravity model, seeks to determine how much dirty money is floating around the world, what portion needs to be laundered, and how much each region is likely to attract. Launderers are expected to gravitate to safe havens and rich economies where it’s easier to hide ill-gotten gains. It assumes that criminals, like most people, channel most of their financial assets into real estate. Geographical and cultural proximity, including a history of migration, are thrown into the mix.“There’s no way of proving it,” but it beats the impossible task of trying to tally up transactions you don’t know about, says John Walker, a former researcher with the Australian Institute of Criminology who first developed the model, said by phone.The government trumpeted thatC$5 billion of the $7 billion washed in the province last year went into real estate — the study’s highest possible estimate. It may be as low as $800 million depending on how criminals save versus invest, according to the report. The study also indicates billions more are being laundered in oil-rich Alberta and Ontario, home to the financial capital Toronto.Finance Minister Carole James says dirty money was responsible for raising housing prices about 5 per cent in the province last year. The report said its best estimate was a range of 3.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent but noted “considerable uncertainty” about the figures.“It’s a tremendous oversimplification,” says Matthew McGuire, a forensic accountant who previously worked for Canada’s financial intelligence unit. “There is money being laundered through real estate, yes, but the factors that influence the change in prices of real estate are far more complex and far greater than just criminality.”On Wednesday, a government news release said the impact on Metro Vancouver prices may have been “upwards of 20 per cent” — the kind of geographic granularity that’s impossible to calculate with current data, the report’s chair Maureen Maloney had said earlier this week. The offices of Horgan, James and Attorney General David Eby didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Vancouver has for years been riveted by stories of rich Asians moving cash into the region: students and homemakers declaring no income but owning multi-million-dollar homes, Chinese high rollers showing up at casinos with hockey bags brimming with cash, and most recently, a thriving grey market in Vancouver-to-China luxury car exports that sent millions of dollars in sales-tax refunds to overseas buyers.That’s fed the perception that Vancouver’s money-laundering problem is in large part an Asian one.But rich economies generate the most dirty money and from crimes related to the financial sector that can move billions at the push of a button, according to Brigitte Unger, a professor at Utrecht University who modelled the Canadian study. She says the Netherlands, considered to be at the forefront in tackling dirty money, had earlier made the same mistake that “money laundering only took place in Chinese restaurants and casinos.”“The big money, I’m still convinced, doesn’t come from China,” said Unger by phone from Vienna. “The big money comes from the U.S. and from Europe because these are the rich countries, which use Canada as a wide-open door because it has much lower restrictions on where to place your money and how to stay anonymous.”The second report had featured a luxury car dealer describing how foreign students come in 10 times a month with no credit and no income and get auto financing based on wire transfers as “unequivocally money laundering.”Flamboyant displays of wealth by students may be unpalatable but not necessarily criminal. An international student who returns home periodically typically isn’t required to report or pay taxes on income from abroad, while cash gifts from family members aren’t taxable under Canadian rules.The second study sifted through more than a million land titles looking for red flags such as overseas buyers, properties bought without financing, opaque addresses and unusual mortgage terms. More than 2,000 properties were classified high risk for simply having mailing addresses in China or Hong Kong.Ultimately, it concluded the approach had limitations.“The ‘suspicious properties’ analysis suggests that a scoring system may not be an effective way to detect properties linked to money laundering,” the study said.Bloomberg.com"

In the Vancouver region, where housing prices rose more than 70 per cent in five years, “I certainly believe that money laundering played a part,” James said.Such a share of transactions is “sufficiently large to have an observable impact on real estate prices,” the report said. It estimated that dirty money pushed B.C. home prices 3.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent higher than they would be in the absence of laundering.A string of investigations commissioned by Premier John Horgan’s government have slowly been revealing in recent months how Vancouver and the surrounding area has become a hub for dirty money, tax evasion, and a place to park foreign cash of unknown origin — no questions asked.Previous reports had revealed how casinos for years were accepting millions in cash often stuffed into hockey bags and suitcases, how gangsters paid auto leases with proceeds of crime, and most recently, how a thriving grey market in Vancouver-to-China luxury car exports sent millions of dollars in sales-tax refunds to overseas buyers.But those pale in scale and scope to the latest findings in real estate, a sector that by some estimates accounts for a third of British Columbia’s gross domestic product and is likened to “the oil” of its economy.Among the numbers revealed in the second report released Thursday, led by independent investigator Peter German who’d earlier probed the casinos, were:• One out of five B.C. properties are bought in cash; over the past two decades• $212 billion in property has been bought in cash• The true owners can’t be identified for the vast majority of $28 billion in B.C. residential property held by legal entities • More than 25 properties worth $34 million have owners listing addresses in countries subject to trade sanctionsThe anecdotal examples are just as staggering:While public scrutiny until now has focused on the role of Chinese money — both legal and illicit — particularly in the Vancouver area, the latest investigation shows the region has been open to all.“Greater Vancouver has acted as a laundromat for foreign organized crime, including a Mexican cartel, Iranian and Mainland Chinese organized crime,” the German report said. “The region has acquired an unenviable reputation for serving as a site for money laundering, drug trafficking, and capital flight.”The provincial government is planning to establish a public registry of beneficial property owners by next year that it says will peel back the anonymity that enables such activity. It’s also continuing to plead with the federal government for more resources and new regulations to better monitor cash transactions and suspicious activity, Attorney General David Eby said.“The party is over,” Eby told reporters Thursday. “It may be spring but winter is finally coming for those who rely on bulk cash transactions in their business model.”Bloomberg.com"

On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales were up 11 per cent in April compared with March. The average selling price of a home climbed 1.9 per cent from a year ago, to $820,148.The rise in sales is an another indication Canada’s biggest real estate market is stabilizing from a recent slump, though it’s off the dizzying heights of a few years ago. Toronto’s housing market cooled considerably last year as officials tightened mortgage regulations, imposed taxes on foreign buyers and took other measures designed to curb runaway prices — raising worries the steps had gone too far.Yet economic fundamentals — everything from strong employment gains to a sharp increase in immigration — remain supportive, as has the dovish tilt globally from central banks that have helped bring down borrowing costs in recent months.“The strong year-over-year growth in sales is obviously a good news story and likely represents some catchup from a slow start to the year,” Garry Bhaura, TREB president, said in the statement.The improving sentiment is also bringing out more sellers, the data show, with new listings up 8 per cent from a year ago. Bhaura noted, however, demand still outpaced increased supply, pointing to the “ongoing housing supply issue” in Toronto that could fuel even more price gains.“This suggests that market conditions continued to tighten,” he said.Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, are up 3.2 per cent from a year ago, the fastest appreciation in more than a year.The sales gains in April were driven by the single-family home segment, while price increases were led by condos, according to the realtor group. Prices for condominiums were up 5.1 per cent in April from a year earlier.Bloomberg.com"

Economists were estimating output would be unchanged.The February data are consistent with an economy that continues to grapple with a number of headwinds and may have barely grown in the first quarter of 2019, extending a slump that began at the end of last year.The monthly numbers are in line with the Bank of Canada’s pared back expectations for the quarter. Without any more growth in March, Canada’s economy may have come to another near halt in the first three months of the year, as the central bank is now predicting. Policy makers expect the economy to pick up from the second quarter on.Falling resource production was the main culprit in February, with the mining and oil and gas sector down 1.6 per cent — its sixth consecutive drop. While the oil and gas sector continued to show weakness, the big decline was in mining and quarrying outside of energy. That component fell 4.4 per cent, driven by reduced output of most types of metals.A tough winter in much of the country also played a role in the contraction, adding to the economy’s woes. This was evident in a 1.6 per cent drop in transportation and warehousing sector, the largest one-month decline for the sector since June 2011. On the flip side, February was a great month for utilities, which saw output jump 1.5 per cent because of the cold.About half of the sectors tracked by Statistics Canada actually posted gains, with increases also recorded by builders, retailers and wholesalers. While conventional oil dropped, the situation in the oilsands seems to be stabilizing. That sector dropped just 0.1 per cent in February, after a 4.1 per cent drop a month earlier. Manufacturing contracted 0.4 per cent, after a 2.1 per cent gain in January that was the largest in nearly to 15 years.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"

That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months.The numbers may bolster hopes that growth is stabilizing after its recent soft patch. Trump, speaking with reporters before departing on a trip on Air Force One, said the GDP numbers were “far higher than the high expectations.”But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers’ 2 per cent objective.Even so, the data showing faster growth and tame inflation helped push Treasury yields lower Friday. U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components — inventories and trade — that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed’s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation’s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump’s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a “great number,” consumer spending “has to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. “We think it will, but it’s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.”“While this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker — namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.” — Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can’t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday’s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final sales to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties.With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Shelly Hagan, Alyza Sebenius, Alister Bull and Justin SinkBloomberg.com"

The nine-bedroom home, dubbed “The Castle” by the 14 students who share the property, is apparently owned by an Afghani pop artist, according to Boodhoo.“Honestly, I would stay here for as long as I could,” he said, sitting on a white couch while sipping from a Slurpee cup. “$1,000 bucks for all this?”Others may also soon find themselves as lucky as more mansion owners in the city turn to renting to avoid a new tax on empty homes. In the new world of Vancouver’s housing market, where Chinese investors are decamping and low-ball offers are the norm, students can find themselves living in the lap of luxury.It’s a far cry from the frenzy of a few years ago when the city was at the centre of a global property boom. Prices more than doubled in the decade through 2016, outpacing gains in New York and London. But government policies to tame the market — from new taxes to stricter mortgage regulations — have fuelled a plunge in sales to the weakest since the global financial crisis. Prices are down 8.5 per cent from their peak in June, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.The city boasts a thriving tech and tourism scene and sits in the province with the lowest unemployment rate in the country. But the sense of unease in the real estate market is palpable.Here are some stories from a property market in upheaval:With taxes on an empty Vancouver home potentially adding up to 3 per cent in annual levies, homeowners are rushing to lease their homes, according to real estate agents. That’s leading to bargains in a city where the vacancy rate has been near zero per cent.“You have houses that are worth $4 million renting for $4,500,” said Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor whose popular real estate blog was pointing out cracks in the market even as benchmark prices peaked last year.Prospective tenants are getting bold, said Kevin Wang, who runs a sales and rental real estate team with his twin brother Jerry. They’ve received calls from people offering to help with gardening or maintenance in exchange for free rent in a luxury home.The owner of “The Castle” and the rental agency didn’t respond to requests for comment.Everyday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I'm just like, that's my houseFor his part, Boodhoo, not only has he scored luxury digs, he’s cut his commute time to his classes in music production to about 18 minutes from two hours.“Everyday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I’m just like, that’s my house,” said Boodhoo, who’s looking forward to the pool in the backyard. It should be filled by June.Lisa Sun paces around the Vancouver mansion she’s been hired to sell by its wealthy Chinese-Canadian owner. The family’s had it with the new taxes and what it sees as increasing hostility to Asian capital. Sun reckons that early last year the home would have easily sold for about $8.5 million — holes in the wall and all.Today, the 28-year-old realtor isn’t sure she’ll get a credible offer for the 8,343 square-foot mansion. These days a pool, wine cellar, and home theatre on a prime lot aren’t enough to clinch a deal, even in West Vancouver, where opulent homes carved out of steep slopes overlook the ocean. Sun needs a “stager” to empty the house and brighten it up with new furniture, a modern chandelier, and lick of paint.“I’ve been through only the peak, never the low,” said Sun as she schedules a makeover of the property. Pink tags indicate to the four cleaners what needs to be dumped. The Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce in the garage, relatively unused for three years, also need to be dealt with.The house is listed at $10.9 million, but after receiving mostly low-ball offers closer to its tax-assessed value of $6.2 million, she’s planning on dropping the asking price closer to $8.3 million.Why would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?That’s a hefty cut but holding on to the home would mean paying potentially more than $140,000 in extra taxes annually for the Canadian owner who splits her time between Vancouver and Beijing. Canadian taxes are not the only measures weighing on the market. China’s capital controls are also limiting spending on global real estate.Sun doesn’t think Vancouver’s market is going to come back to its highs, especially at the top end. “Why would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?”Buying a house seemed an impossible dream for Brandon Chapman.The 28-year-old financial planner first started looking at one-bedroom condos in 2016, around the peak of the market. “It was just bananas so I took a step back,” he said, in an interview at his Vancouver office.He’s glad he waited. He now figures he might even be able to afford a detached home and is viewing properties at around the $1.1 million mark in East Vancouver. To make it affordable, he’s teaming up with his best friend to purchase the property — and offering way under asking. It hasn’t quite worked out yet. One offer for about $200,000 less than the listing price was rejected.It's like a candy store for buyers right now“We haven’t closed on anything but the market in my opinion is still trending down so why would I rush into buying something if I don’t need it this second?” he said.Then there’s Robin Rickards, who happened to be looking for a temporary home at a serendipitous time. The 64-year-old orthopedic surgeon needed a place to stay while his current home was being rebuilt into an oceanside oasis. He ended up making an offer on three different homes and got one for almost $1 million less than the original asking price.“It’s like a candy store for buyers right now,” Clara Hartree, the realtor working with Rickards, said by email.The twisty, cantilevered glass tower is one of Vancouver’s most hotly anticipated developments. It starts as a triangle at its base — wedged awkwardly between the on and off ramps of a downtown highway — before swivelling into a square at the top.That iconic silhouette helped developer Westbank Corp. rapidly sell out some 400 ultra-luxe units when presales began in 2014, thanks in part to avid interest from Asian buyers. As it nears completion, investors are seeking to offload rights to more than two dozen units, according to listings cropping up on realtor websites.One flyer offers a 368-square-foot unit at $515,000. “Transfer at original price,” it reads in Chinese. Last year, it would’ve fetched as much as $800,000, says Jerry Huang, a realtor with Nu Stream Realty Inc., which specializes in presale developments.“That’s an insane deal,” he said. Presales were once seen as a slam dunk — put down a 20 per cent deposit, flip the contract at a premium before completion, and pocket the gains.Westbank said in an email that in the five years since some investors purchased, values have appreciated from 25 per cent to 100 per cent depending on the unit. The number of so-called assignment sales is less than 10 per cent of total units in the building and “in-line with expectation.”The job of the real estate agent has become much tougher nowBut the broader downturn is beginning to catch some out across various developments.Those who bought at the peak need to find a buyer fast or come up with the full amount to pay the developer. With banks in some cases assessing units lower than the contract price, buyers hoping for a loan may face a shortfall. “There are no assurances right now,” says Adil Dinani, a realtor with Royal LePage — some sellers may be lucky just to break even.There have always been buyers who overextended and needed to sell quickly.“But the difference is earlier, we were able to help them because the market was going up,” says Sonny Bhinder, a realtor who’s received calls from half a dozen clients seeking to sell assignments since the start of the year. “The job of the real estate agent has become much tougher now.”–With assistance from Feifei Shen, Paul Panckhurst and Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

A separate report showed retail sales unexpectedly declined in January, reinforcing concerns about consumers paring back.The numbers suggest a relatively soft picture for an economy in the middle of a slowdown, with enough slack to limit any price pressures that could be a source of concern for the Bank of Canada. Retail sales were the big disappointment, underscoring a broader trend of slowing consumption by households as they face higher borrowing costs, moderating housing markets and volatility in financial markets.“Today brought a mixed bag of economic reports from Canada, with inflation showing a small spark but retail sales surprisingly sluggish at the start of the year,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, wrote in a note to clients. For the Bank of Canada, the main message is “rates are in lock-down mode for the foreseeable future,” he said.The Canadian dollar remained lower after the reports, trading down 0.3 per cent at 74.61 US cents at 9:10 a.m. in Toronto trading. Government 2-year bonds yielded 1.56 per cent, a drop of 5 basis points from Thursday and the least since 2017.Economists had predicted inflation would remain unchanged at 1.4 per cent. Core measures — seen as a better gauge of underlying price pressures — dropped slightly to 1.83 per cent from 1.87 per cent.The Bank of Canada anticipates inflation will remain below its 2 per cent target for most of this year, one reason it’s unlikely to be in a hurry to lift borrowing costs any further. In fact, markets have started to price in a possible rate cut.There are few signs of any price pressure in the report. Inflation in the service sector was down to 2.3 per cent in February, from 2.7 per cent the previous month. Excluding gasoline, inflation was 2.1 per cent in February, unchanged from the previous month.Food has been a major driver of inflation gains over the past year. Excluding food prices however, inflation was just 1.2 per cent.The retail numbers also showed underlying weakness in the economy, damping hopes for a better start to the year after promising January numbers from manufacturers and wholesalers over the past week.Canada’s economy stalled in the final quarter of last year, and economists have been expecting it to remain weak to start 2019. Receipts for retailers have fallen for three straight months, and for five of the past six.“After a weak December, there was at least some hope for January retailing in Canada, but hopes that didn’t pan out in the data today,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto, said in a note to investors.On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.7 per cent, more than the 0.6 per cent gain expected by analysts. The monthly gain was driven by higher prices for travel tours and cars.Gasoline prices increased 1.9 per cent during the month, the first advance since July. They have fallen 21 per cent since then.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"

Those measures don’t come into effect until fall of this year, meaning some Canadians might hold off jumping into real estate until they can take advantage.The delayed purchases might further dent an already weakened housing market. Home sales across the country have been dismal in recent months, falling 9.1 per cent in February to the lowest level since 2012, and the slowdown is widespread across Canadian cities.“First-time home buyer activity is poised to slow down between now and September 2019, as many house-hunting millennials await more details and crunch their numbers.” Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note Wednesday. “This could depress the market even further during that period.”The new measures may also make it tough for the Bank of Canada to get a proper read on the housing sector. Policy makers there have noted the difficulty of disentangling the effects of federal mortgage regulations and higher interest rates on the real estate market.But even if sales are damped throughout the spring and summer selling season, Hogue expects a rebound just prior to the federal election, when Canadians begin to access the new measures, which will be administered by the federal housing agency.“Any delayed purchases will fuel stronger activity in the fall,” Hogue said.Bloomberg.com"

Few have been as devoted to the art as Stephen Poloz.He’s trying to steer the economy back to a place where it can support the kind of borrowing costs that counted as normal before 2008. But Poloz’s metaphors often have to do with unforeseen hardships when you’re on the way home — sailors blown off course, or drivers caught in winter storms. Because, like many global peers, he’s finding the journey hard to map out.One reason is a feature of today’s developed economies that isn’t normal at all by past standards: their mountain of private debt. Canada has some of the most leveraged households anywhere — leading analysts to question how much higher rates can go, and even whether they’ve already gone too far.With five interest-rate increases since 2017, the Bank of Canada is one of a handful to embark on sustained hiking. Poloz has even won international recognition for developing frameworks to manage the process. But there’s been no increase since October, and the Ottawa-based bank said last week that the cycle’s immediate future looks increasingly uncertain amid a global slowdown. Like the Federal Reserve, it’s essentially on hold, waiting to see what happens.Poloz acknowledges he’s getting heat over higher borrowing costs, in a country where so many households have a direct stake. People write to him. “Believe me, I feel it,” he said in an interview. “It’s not a theoretical exercise.”That helps explain the folksy analogies — and also Poloz’s discretionary approach. He shuns the precision of models, sees data more in terms of feeling a pulse than feeding a machine, and recognizes that central banking involves mystery as well as technical expertise.The goal is to assure as wide a chunk of the public as possible that policy makers won’t hike unless they’re sure the economy can cope with higher borrowing costs. As long as inflation isn’t a threat, they’ll put growth first.In the global monetary debate after 2008, Poloz has often been on the dovish side — particularly early in his term.The concern, then and now, is that cheap money is a zero-sum game. It brings spending forward, but slows it down in the future, and adds financial vulnerabilities — like high household debt and elevated housing prices in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.Poloz counters by pointing out that the leverage already out there makes tightening risky too. Plus, he sees potential long-term benefits from frontloading demand.Exports and investment remain below pre-crisis levels as a share of the economy, leaving Canada reliant on consumption and housing. Wage gains are smaller than in the past. The number of new firms being created, an important metric for Poloz, is lacklustre. What if Canada’s economy is on the cusp of an investment boom that may not be detectable yet, and companies are holding back because they lack confidence? Productivity typically picks up late in the business cycle, and policy makers shouldn’t get in the way of that by removing stimulus too quickly.Yet, if the purpose of low rates has been to nurse the economy back to normal, then the ability to raise them should be the ultimate gauge of health.With the jobless rate at four-decade lows, and underlying inflation back near the two per cent target, there were signs that the economy was nearing its capacity — which is why Poloz began to hike.The Bank of Canada has been envisaging a final resting place for rates around three per cent. But so far it’s only got about halfway there. And as other central banks scale back their expectations, investors are anticipating that Poloz will have to follow.Markets no longer believe he’ll be able to raise rates any further — or that Canada’s economy, burdened by heavy debt and aging demographics, can grow much faster than the current, modest pace. Ten-year Canadian bond yields are stuck below two per cent, lower even than they were on Poloz’s first day on the job in 2013.That raises an awkward question for Poloz, and maybe for some of his central-bank peers too: Has monetary policy already done all it can?As he prepares to enter the final year of his seven-year term, Poloz could lay claim to be one of Canada’s most successful central bankers ever. The country is closer to a state of full employment and stable prices than at any time since the 1960s — exactly the sort of benchmarks policy makers are supposed to aim for.It’s just that one of the slowest recoveries on record wouldn’t be a very satisfying finish line. Most economists currently put potential growth at no higher than two per cent. In the last six quarters the economy hasn’t even managed that, averaging 1.6 per cent.As well as telling stories about journeys home, Poloz also likes to invoke “Mother Nature” and argue that economies are capable of regenerating themselves. In the interview, he expressed confidence that Canada can climb back toward the faster growth it once took for granted — if “all the ingredients work out.”“I see no reason why we should settle for our two per cent trend-line,” he said.–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

It’s now under three,” Brown, 49, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s office in Toronto. “So we’re bringing in money from other firms from clients that had maybe three or four managers and have consolidated things with us.”Manulife Asset Management has about US$364 billion under management. It doesn’t break down assets in its wealth unit but Brown said the 45-person team currently caters to about 400 households with an average portfolio of about $3 million (US$2.3 million). Managers look after no more than 125 households.Manulife started its wealth business in Toronto about six years ago and now has offices in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. Clients must have $1 million in liquid assets and are generally referred by independent advisers. The firm charges 1.45 per cent on the first $2 million and the fee goes down from there.Canada ranked eighth worldwide for the number of individuals with at least US$1 million to invest in 2017, holding a combined wealth of US$1.2 trillion, according to Capgemini SE. Solid economic growth, a real estate boom and vibrant tech and marijuana industries are fuelling newfound riches. Aging business owners and baby boomers are looking to cash out, Brown said.It’s a business coveted by financial services companies that bulked up in the space as they diversify away from a slowing housing market. Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed to buy Greystone Capital Management in July, adding a platform with alternative assets and funds attractive to the wealthy. Bank of Nova Scotia spent $3.54 billion last year on MD Financial Management, which caters to doctors and their families, and Montreal-based money manager Jarislowsky Fraser.Brown, who has more than 20 years experience working with high net worth clients, including at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank, said BMO Private Banking, the unit of Bank of Montreal, is one of Canada’s biggest players in the sector, he said.Returns for Manulife Private Wealth clients vary depending on the client’s goals, be it buying a retirement home in Florida or setting up a philanthropy fund for their grandchildren, but expectations are usually similar to a pension fund, Brown said.“What we’re hoping to do is get a creative add on by using active managers and paying that premium for active managers so that the 4.7 per cent return expectation turns into a 6.3 per cent actual return,” for example, Brown said.A typical portfolio is currently about 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent fixed income with about 70 per cent of the equity held outside Canada, whose 5.5 per cent annual return in its benchmark stock index has lagged the U.S. by about half over the past five years. Their U.S. equity manager holds about 37 stocks, focusing on blue chips which are more conservative than the broader index.“We’re not going to take the outlandish risks that somebody might take if they’re day trading on their own PC,” he said.Investors’ expectations need to be reset as the world economy slows, he cautioned.“We’re going to continue to see volatility,” he said. “That’s become more the norm than we would like to see. It’s self perpetuating, so every headline that comes out with something just continues to feed into the cycle on that.”–With assistance from Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.com"

That leaves Montreal’s soaring market poised to overtake the Pacific coast city’s.In January, the total dollar value of real estate transactions in Vancouver fell to $1.7 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, the weakest level since 2013 and down 42 per cent from a year earlier, according to data released Friday by the Canadian Real Estate Association. Meanwhile, the value of transactions in Montreal reached $1.63 billion to start the year, an increase of 18 per cent from last January. Montreal — which has much cheaper homes, but more transactions — hasn’t been this close to Vancouver since 2008.Montreal is the business capital of the largely French-speaking province of Quebec and Canada’s second largest city by population. But it was left out of the boom that saw home prices in Toronto and Vancouver surge to levels that made those cities unaffordable and prompted a rush of regulations to slow down them down.These measures have included new regional taxes on foreign buyers in Toronto and Vancouver that aren’t in place in Montreal. Higher interest rates and tougher rules for mortgage lending also seem to be having the biggest effect on the country’s priciest markets.January saw home sales in Montreal climb the fastest in a decade as lower prices and a booming economy lured buyers. Sales in the city advanced 7.1 per cent from December, the fastest pace since May 2009, and the number of units sold reached a record. Montreal’s gains are well ahead of identical moves in Vancouver and Toronto where sales rose 1.2 per cent, and double the national increase of 3.6 per cent.There’s far less concern Montreal will show the signs of overheating seen in Canada’s two other major cities, given price differentials.“Much of the recent price appreciation and sales increases, that really reflects the strength of the economy,” Marc Desormeaux, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by phone from Toronto. “Montreal remains relatively affordable.”Montreal’s benchmark home price was $349,300 in January, up 6.3 per cent from a year earlier. That’s still far less than the Vancouver price of $1.02 million, which is down 4.5 per cent.Canada’s largest city Toronto still has by far the most real estate transactions, reaching $5.4 billion to start the year, albeit greatly reduced from the $8.5 billion in activity seen at the beginning of 2017.Bloomberg.com"

Toronto and Vancouver posted their worst year for sales in at least a decade last year. Vancouver’s market waned further in January as average prices tumbled 9.1 per cent over the past 12 months.“This is not something that’s just spontaneously happening: This is an engineered slowdown with the banks being willing participants in some of these changes that have been made,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in an interview. “It makes for a healthier lending environment and a healthier housing environment for the longer term.”An overinflated housing market and high debt are among the reasons cited by some U.S. hedge funds and short-sellers over the years who have bet against the Canadian banks. On average, about 2.4 per cent of shares of the six biggest Canadian banks is held in short-interest positions as of the end of January, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Vindication for those shorts appears some way off for now. The eight-member S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index has tread water for about two years. It gained about 3.3 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent increase in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and a 4.4 per cent gain in the U.S. KBW Bank Index.Canadian bank executives have already been conveying their expectations for slower growth this year.Toronto-Dominion Bank’s Teri Currie, who oversees the domestic banking division at Canada’s largest bank by assets, expects “mid-single digit” growth this year in residential secured lending, which includes amortizing home-equity credit lines and mortgages.“In today’s context it’s sending a strong statement that the investments that we’ve made are going to pay off in relatively good growth,” she said in a Jan. 22 interview.Executives at rival banks are expecting domestic mortgage growth to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2019, when the country’s economic expansion is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent.Investor David Baskin, whose Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion, said he’d rather banks focus on wealth management. “I’m not looking for the banks to grow their mortgage business,” he said. “I don’t think that’s where the juice is.”Steve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7.5 billion, said the banks are countering the slowdown in residential lending with growth in business loans — something that makes Belisle a bit uneasy. Canada’s six biggest banks had an 11 per cent jump in commercial lending last year.“The overall loan growth for the banks is actually steady — it has been around 4.5 per cent — and that’s because they are offsetting the slowdown in mortgages with commercial lending, which is low double digits,” Belisle said. “That’s adding risk at the peak of the economic cycle.”Bloomberg.com"

In a background document released in November, the ministry touted the economic benefits of adding 10,000 housing starts a year, an amount builders estimate would bring supply closer to demand.Supply side measures are seen as critical to restoring affordability in some of Canada’s largest cities like Toronto, where prices have doubled since 2010. They would also ease pressure on policy makers to implement demand curbs that are seen as unnecessarily disruptive.“We have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable cost,” Clark said in a telephone interview, describing the affordability issue as a “crisis.”There is already growing concern that tighter mortgage regulations and other recent changes may have overshot, given last year’s plunge in transactions. Demand measures are blunt instruments that apply to all markets regardless of affordability, and disproportionately affect low-income households and youth. Supply measures, in comparison, allow markets to continue growing, albeit at a more sustainable pace.We have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable costToronto, along with Vancouver on the Pacific coast, has the lowest price elasticity of any urban market in Canada, meaning supply is the most out of sync with demand, according to a report last year from the federal housing agency.Developers agree. It takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association. The group estimates the GTA needs 50,000 new units a year to meet projected demand, but only about 40,000 are being built on average.“The issue in our view for the sharp rise in prices and the affordability issue fundamentally is the supply side not being able to adjust quickly enough to demand,” Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, said by phone from Toronto. “So a big part of the solution is on the supply side. Except you have to be more patient, because it takes a while.” He said Clark’s proposals ” are the right types of measures” to ensure market imbalances get addressed more quickly.It’s unclear how Clark’s reforms would affect one major contributor to supply bottlenecks: delays to infrastructure projects such as highways and sewer systems. The minister’s proposed changes to the growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the swath of cities surrounding Toronto that’s home to a quarter of Canada’s population, deal more with speeding up development approvals and updating zoning and intensification targets, rather than streamlining infrastructure regulations that are seen as excessive and unpredictable.The previous government’s focus on policy ideas just ended up “grinding things down to a halt,” said Joe Vaccaro, chief executive officer at the Ontario Home Builders’ Association. He’s calling on Ford to “clear the decks and get things moving again” by making decisions on several stalled infrastructure projects.One of those is the Upper York Sewage Solutions Project, a $715 million (US$541 million) wastewater treatment system that was supposed to service 30,000 new homes in three towns in York Region, a municipality of about 1.1 million people north of Toronto.Mike Rabeau, director of capital planning in the region’s environmental services division, began work on the environmental assessment in 2009. Five years and $25 million later, he submitted the 16,000 page report to Ontario’s environment ministry, expecting a decision within eight months. More than four years later, he’s still waiting.“If you can’t flush a toilet, you can’t build a home,” Rabeau said by phone, adding the expected project completion date is now 2026 at the earliest.After early signals the project would be approved, environment ministry officials told Rabeau in late 2016 there were some outstanding issues concerning the duty to consult indigenous groups. Discussions between these groups, the provincial government and York Region are ongoing, according to a ministry spokesman.The delay is typical of a broader problem with building infrastructure in the GTA. “We’re growing at a fairly rapid rate, and we’ve got this conundrum that infrastructure has to go through quite a complex approval process,” James McKellar, a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University, said in a phone interview. “Our ability to bring infrastructure online in a timely way just doesn’t exist.”Michael Fenn, a former Ontario deputy minister and a visiting fellow at the Ivey Business School’s Lawrence National Centre, says housing should be given particular emphasis when it comes to infrastructure development. “Keeping housing of a variety of types affordable and available is crucial to the economic success” of the GTA and the country generally, he said.Clark acknowledges housing supply is a “very complex problem,” and he stopped short of saying the environment minister should approve the York sewage project. He nevertheless understands the municipality’s frustration. “That’s an example of something that, if you talk to the region, is taking way too long to get approved,” he said.–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Melinda Grenier.Bloomberg.com"

Get breaking analysis and commentary Wednesday on the Bank of Canada rate decision. “We’re seeing a bump, and in some provinces that bump is significant,” David Lewis, a board member at the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, said by phone from Edmonton. Lewis blamed economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and softening housing prices.On a year-over-year basis, filings during the two months were up in every province except Prince Edward Island, which was unchanged, according to the OSB data. Alberta was the hardest hit, with insolvencies rising 16 per cent.Hoyes, Michalos & Associates Inc. estimates consumer filings in Ontario rose 1 per cent in 2018, after declining for eight straight years. In a statement on its website, the insolvency firm predicts filings in the nation’s most-populous province will increase by “a minimum” of 2 per cent to 5 per cent in 2019, and may jump as much as 8 per cent “if interest rates continue to rise and housing prices fall,” though even at that rate total insolvencies would still be well below the 2009 peak.Increased proposal filings may represent the tip of the waveAbout 66 per cent of Ontario insolvencies in November were consumer proposals, which is the highest share on record, and may indicate trouble to come, according to Ted Michalos, a licensed insolvency trustee and co-founder of the firm. In a proposal, the debtor agrees with creditors to pay a proportion of what’s owed and is allowed to keep their assets, versus bankruptcies, where debts are written off but assets are usually forfeited, with the exception of certain provincial exemptions.“Increased proposal filings may represent the tip of the wave,” Michalos said by email. “The people that want to be pro-active file first, the rest of the folks that are in trouble are still to follow.”With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"

That would be the biggest increase since 2016, when stocks gained 18 per cent.“Our expectation is that 2019 is going to be a better year than 2018 based on the fact that pessimism right now is at extreme levels,” Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital Corp., said in a phone interview. “When everybody’s on the same trade, when everybody’s negative, we think this is a good opportunity to go in the other direction.”Bangsund expects the S&P/TSX to end 2019 at 16,800 amid strong earnings, and recommends investors overweight beaten-down energy stocks and financials. This time last year, she predicted the market would finish 2018 at 16,900 and later raised that target to 17,300.Instead, the Canadian benchmark fell 12 per cent in 2018 to 14,323, with most of that drop coming in the final quarter of the year amid a decline in global stocks. Concerns about a global trade war, rising interest rates, a housing slowdown and plunging oil prices all weighed on the Canadian market.Energy stocks were the worst performers, posting a decline of 21 per cent, followed by consumer discretionary, down 18 per cent. Even pot stocks, which were a bastion of optimism for Canadian investors as the country legalized recreational marijuana, ended the year in negative territory.It’s been a frustrating experience for investors and strategists alike. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, had a strong track record of calling the market before 2018. His forecast for the S&P/TSX in 2017 was only 200 points below the final closing number while his 2016 forecast came within 12 points of the close. His estimate of 17,600 for 2018 was off by a wide margin, however. Belski sees 2019 ending at 18,000, 26 per cent above current levels.“Fundamentals can, will, and should be rewarded at some point,” he wrote in a 2019 market outlook published in November. “In our view, the best time to be contrarian is when the analysis is telling you something exceedingly different from what sentiment and rhetoric is exhibiting.” He added that “Canada is rich with solid companies” and investors should take a bottom-up approach to stock picking, paying particular attention to energy and financials.Not everyone is optimistic there will be a big rebound. Sadiq Adatia, who manages about $23 billion (US$17 billion) as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, sees the S&P/TSX closing out the year at 15,000, just 4.7 per cent above current levels. Adatia was the most bearish forecaster last year as well, initially predicting the benchmark would end the year at 15,200 and later raising that to a range of 16,000 to 16,250.“What has me worried is that consumers are losing steam” amid rising interest rates, Adatia said in a phone interview, adding that he expects the Bank of Canada will hike rates once in 2019 but would prefer if it didn’t hike at all.“Rates will impact how consumers spend going forward, how they deal with their debt levels and what happens in the housing market as well,” he said. However, Canada may not fare as badly as some of its global counterparts.“We think if you hold a portion of your portfolio in Canada, it’s because of risk management,” he said. “If we get a major continuation of the selloff and we get into bear market territory, Canada might actually hold up relatively well because it hasn’t participated fully on the upside of this bull market.”Here are the strategists’ calls for 2019, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,000Edward Jones: 15,600Russell Investments: 16,000Scotia Capital: 16,500Fiera Capital: 16,800Manulife: 17,250BMO Capital Markets: 18,000Laurentian Bank: 18,000Bloomberg.com"

They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,” Trump said in a tweet Monday. “The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch — he can’t putt!”The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch – he can’t putt!Trump’s latest broadside added to the sense of alarm among investors already rattled by turmoil in Washington that includes his private musings about sacking Powell and the government shutdown that followed his about-face on a stopgap spending bill. U.S. stocks fell back toward their session lows after Trump’s outburst, with the S&P 500 Index on track to close at a 19-month low.The president’s Twitter post didn’t mention Powell, a Trump nominee who has overseen four rate hikes this year to prevent the economy from overheating.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sought to reassure investors over the weekend that Powell’s job is safe. He held a conference call Monday with regulators that oversee banks and markets to try, without success, to restore calm.“The market is lacking full confidence in the Fed right now, but part of it is Trump’s undermining of it,” said Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors LLC in Washington and former Treasury official under President George W. Bush.While Fed rate hikes have contributed to equity declines and a softer housing market, the American economy is being buffeted by a few factors owing to the Trump administration and Congress.Trump’s trade war with China is creating uncertainty for businesses. U.S. government debt is approaching US$22 trillion. A federal shutdown this week is raising concerns about Washington’s ability to find bipartisan solutions to pressing problems.Recent data show economic growth is holding up fairly well but may moderate heading into next year. The labour market is solid and unemployment at 3.7 per cent is the lowest since 1969. One measure of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in December as views on economic conditions improved, helping bolster the outlook for American spending.Gross domestic product is seen expanding 2.9 per cent this year, buoyed by tax cuts and higher federal spending signed by Trump, but the pace is expected to slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus fades. The White House argues lower corporate taxes will boost productivity and help the economy grow faster without causing inflation, and therefore the Fed doesn’t need to tighten policy.The turmoil engulfing Washington — and the financial market rout that’s happening in response — widened after Bloomberg News, late Friday, reported Trump’s discussion about firing Powell. Mnuchin said in a pair of tweets Saturday evening that he’d spoken with the president about the matter, and he quoted Trump saying he didn’t believe he had the authority to remove the central bank chief.Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s pick for the next White House chief of staff, said Sunday he’d spoken to Mnuchin and that Trump “now realizes he does not have the ability” to fire a Fed chairman.Trump has yet to publicly affirm that belief himself.Bloomberg.com"

They say November was their busiest on record, and December — typically a slow time of year in the insolvency trade — hasn’t let up.“I’m essentially trying to add capacity every day to get people seen,” Blair Mantin, a Vancouver-based licensed insolvency trustee at Sands & Associates, said by phone. “Usually things slow down around Christmas, but we haven’t seen the demand slow down this year.”The interviews, while anecdotal, add to recent indications rate hikes are beginning to take a toll, and suggest insolvencies may keep rising. The latest official data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies showed the rate of consumer insolvencies rose 9.4 per cent in October on an annual basis, the most since 2016.Insolvency data can be volatile, but it appears Canadian consumers are at an inflection point. “The tide has turned, and the water’s starting to rise,” Ted Michalos, a licensed insolvency trustee at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates Inc., said in a phone interview. “Now it’s just a question of how quickly does it rise.”The effects of higher borrowing costs are beginning to be felt broadly. Vehicle sales, among the sectors most sensitive to rising rates, fell the most since 2009, while growth in residential mortgages decelerated to the slowest pace since 1982, worrying signs for an economy so reliant on consumption.The tide has turned, and the water's starting to rise. Now it's just a question of how quickly does it riseIn addition, liabilities are eating up a bigger share of disposable income. Canada’s debt service ratio climbed to 14.51 on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, the highest since 2008, the federal statistics agency reported last week.Hoyes, Michalos — which usually accounts for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of insolvency filings in Ontario — just had its busiest November since opening in 1999. The insolvency trustee and debt relief agency received 1,000 new inquiries, compared with 650 in November 2017, and initiated 384 new filings, surpassing the previous high of 350 in November 2009. Through the first 10 days of December, Michalos said the firm’s numbers are up 57 per cent from a year earlier.Lower gasoline prices aren’t fully offsetting higher mortgage costs, and “there is very little room in many Canadians’ budgets to absorb these increased costs,” he said, adding he’s also seeing more clients with so-called installment loans, basically large, high-interest payday loans that can be paid off over a longer period.Mantin, whose Vancouver-based firm recorded it’s biggest year-over-year increase in filings in November since he joined eight years ago, also cited an increase in large payday loans among his clients. He said previously it would have been typical to see payday loans of $500 (US$373) or $1,000. Now he sometimes sees “installment loans” of $15,000.Higher rates are hitting at a time when consumers are already struggling to cope with the recent housing boom. Mantin says the majority of clients in the firm’s downtown Vancouver office pay 50 per cent or more of their income in rent, “and you can only do that for so long,” he said. Other clients are young families who overextended themselves at the peak of the boom, often tapping home equity to make renovations, and now can’t sell.Grant Bazian, president at MNP Ltd., said November was the agency’s busiest ever, with year-over-year growth in filings of about 12 per cent. For December, “it looks like the trend is holding up,” putting MNP on pace for a record fourth quarter, he said.“The biggest driver of the increased filings appears to be rising interest rates,” Bazian said by phone from Vancouver. “People just get in over their heads.”The Bank of Canada has raised rates five times since mid-2017, and Governor Stephen Poloz has said he’s watching the economy closely to gauge the effects. Investors are increasingly sure the bank will proceed more slowly, with implied odds showing one more increase over the next 12 months. In October, the expectation was for three more.David Lewis, an Edmonton-based board member at the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, which represents about 1,000 insolvency professionals, said higher borrowing costs are already having an impact.“Most of our membership believe that it’s not a blip, that we will see an uptick in numbers just because of the interest rates rising,” he said in a phone interview. “People are finding they can’t deal with the debt month to month, that they could have dealt with six or eight months ago because they’re paying extra interest on it all.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s the biggest monthly drop in eight months. The benchmark price, which adjusts for the types of houses sold, fell 0.4 per cent from last month to $763,600.The housing market in the Toronto region has been stabilizing after a slowdown in sales and prices earlier this year amid tougher mortgage-lending rules. The market picked up pace through the summer, though sales have declined for the third month in a row now.The drop in sales could in part be attributed to a decline in new listings, which fell 26 per cent to 10,534 from last November.“New listings were actually down more than sales on a year-over-year basis in November,” Garry Bhaura, the president of the board, said in a statement. “This suggests that, in many neighbourhoods, competition between buyers may have increased. Relatively tight market conditions over the past few months have provided the foundation for renewed price growth.”Average home prices rose 3.5 per cent to $788,345 from last year, though sales were down 15 per cent over the same period.The semi-detached housing segment was the strongest performing sector with average prices rising 8.3 per cent to $791,760 on the year. Condo prices jumped 7.5 per cent to $556,723.Given the impact of new mortgage stress tests and higher borrowing costs, it makes sense that condos and the semi-detached market experienced relatively stronger rates of price growth in November, Jason Mercer, the board’s director of market analysis, said.Bloomberg.com"

The Canadian Home Builders’ Association said the rules are hitting millennials and struggling markets like Calgary particularly hard.The rules, put in place in January, require even those with a 20 per cent down payment, who don’t need mortgage insurance, to prove that they can make payments at 2 percentage points above the contracted rate. The so-called B-20 stress tests already existed for insured mortgages. By April, the average home price in Toronto had tumbled 12 per cent from the same month the prior year, though has since stabilized.“We’re going to continue to lobby for a pullback now on B-20,” Brad Carr, chief executive officer of Mattamy Homes Canada, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “That had a very targeted outcome. It’s been achieved so it’s kind of overkill now.”As rates rise “they’re doing their natural job and that 2 per cent spread, we certainly hope the government will either remove it or at least cap it,” Carr said. Peter Gilgan, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Mattamy Homes, added that a reduction to 1.5 per cent or 1 per cent would make sense.“Ideally at this point the best thing would be for the new stress test to be repealed, just removed,” David Foster, director of communications at the CHBA said. “Markets like Calgary, they’re already quite soft, are just hammered by this.”Foster said the restrictions are disproportionately affecting young first-time buyers and the longer the rules are in place the more disenfranchised that age cohort is going to be. The stress tests also perversely tend to push people into open variable rate mortgages or the non-regulated space, neither of which are without significant risk to the borrower, he said.A spokeswoman for the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said it wasn’t able to immediately respond.Bloomberg.com"

Our approach here ensures a truly mixed-income community,' exec says",,,1,,2018-11-30,https://business.financialpost.com/technology/alphabet-aims-to-win-over-toronto-with-affordable-housing,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/sidewalk-labs1.jpg,"Alphabet Inc.’s digital city on Toronto’s waterfront will be made out of wood, heated by geothermal wells and offer a swathe of affordable housing as it seeks to win over a skeptical public concerned about privacy issues at the development.Sidewalk Labs LLC, the urban innovation unit of Google parent Alphabet says about 40 per cent of the 2,500 residential units on the 4.9-hectare (12-acre) development dubbed “Quayside,” will be below-market housing, including 20 per cent affordable. Just over half will be purpose-built rental.“Toronto is effectively in a state of housing gridlock. People feel stuck where they are, they’re unable to get into the market, whether its owning homes or even just renting,” Jesse Shapins, director of public realm at Sidewalk, said in media briefing Thursday. “We’re making an unprecedented commitment here to below-market housing. Our approach here ensures a truly mixed-income community and we hope this can be a model for really tackling the housing challenges in Toronto today.”Sidewalk’s proposal comes amid an immigration and economic boom in the city that’s sent rents soaring and driven the vacancy rate for condos rentals to 1.1 per cent and for purpose-built rentals to 0.5 per cent. At the same time, Sidewalk’s project has been entrenched in controversy over concerns about how data collected from smartphones, sensors and the like will be controlled and protected.Sidewalk didn’t release any further plans for data on Thursday. The company has proposed that an independent civic data trust be created to oversee the control of the information and advocated for an independent body to set privacy rules for the development.The company plans to use mass timber to construct all of its buildings which will likely be 30 stories or lower and be a mix of residential, commercial spaces with lower floors for retail, arts or community areas. Proponents of mass timber or engineered wood say the product is as strong and fire-resistant as those made from steel or concrete, and Sidewalk said its use in the development could spark a new industry in Canada.Energy in buildings will be managed by an AI-powered system that would result in 20 per cent less energy use while the project is targeting a 75 per cent to 85 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases with heat recovery and geothermal technology.More than 9,000 jobs will be created in the province as a result of the building construction process in Quayside, which will likely be home to 3,900 jobs with a focus on technology and urban innovation. Sidewalk Labs plans to test out technologies related to autonomous vehicles in Quayside to prepare for a future of driverless cars.The plans have yet to be approved by the project’s stakeholders, which includes Waterfront Toronto, the government organization overseeing the project, Alphabet Inc. and the City of Toronto. Sidewalk Labs will bring its proposals forward for approval next spring.Dan Doctoroff, the chief executive officer of Sidewalk Labs, was CEO of Bloomberg LP and deputy mayor of New York City under Michael Bloomberg, Bloomberg’s founder.Bloomberg.com"

Credit cards. Taxis. The Thanksgiving turkey. Even divorce. This generation’s cultural killing spree has left few corners untouched.Now there’s evidence for an appeal. A new Federal Reserve paper says the app-loving, participation-trophy-receiving cohort, defined as those born between 1981 and 1997, aren’t really different from their parents. They’re just poorer than previous generations were at this point in their lives, thanks to a large portion of the group coming of age during the financial crisis.“We find little evidence that millennial households have tastes and preference for consumption that are lower than those of earlier generations, once the effects of age, income, and a wide range of demographic characteristics are taken into account,” wrote authors Christopher Kurz, Geng Li and Daniel J. Vine.Their findings are grounded in an analysis of spending, income, debt, net worth, and demographic factors among different generations. The conclusion that millennials aren’t all that different also holds for the researchers’ more granular examination of expenditures on cars, food, and housing.“It primarily is the differences in average age and then differences in average income that explain a large and important portion of the consumption wedge between millennials and other cohorts,” they conclude.So much for the young folks favouring “experiences” over tangible goods.Millennials aren’t unique snowflakes when it comes to what they spend their money on, either. The report finds that shifts in expenditure shares between different goods and services have been broadly consistent regardless of age. Housing and food are two areas where millennials have spent less than previous generations, with the younger cohort paying more for education. As a caveat, spending on avocado toast wasn’t specifically tracked for this analysis.What’s old is new again. The paper observes that some of the millennials’ parents were subject to similar baseless grumbles of “kids these days” from their elders.“A similar question was posed 20 years ago when Baby Boomer profligacy was being compared to the Silent Generation’s penchant for saving,” they wrote. “Speaking to that debate, Sabelhaus and Manchester (1995) were able to separate fact from popular myth at the time and provided evidence that consumption had not increased as much as income, and that Baby Boomer asset accumulation had in fact outpaced that of the previous generation.”Bloomberg.com"
