He noted Fed officials had debated whether to follow other central banks in that direction and opted to use other tools and said “for now it’s not something we’re considering.” The S&P 500 fell at the open and traders pushed bets on a negative Fed benchmark rate later into next year as investors absorbed Powell’s speech, which highlighted the risks of lasting economic harm due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I don’t think he could have been clearer, but market participants have not been willing to take ‘no’ for an answer yet, so I am not optimistic that the message will be absorbed this time either,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities said in a note to clients. --With assistance from Michael McKee."

HSBC said that the gold market “became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,” contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to “market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.” It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC’s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium. The precious metal surged more than 30% in the first three weeks of January, before tumbling at the end of the month.Read More: HSBC, BNP Repeatedly Breached Trading Limits in Market ChaosHSBC is not alone in its recent struggles with precious metals.

That’s why we created Ask BNN Bloomberg, where you can have your personal finance questions answered by industry professionals. Email or send your questions via video to askbnnbloomberg@bellmedia.ca, and we will aim to answer them weekly. Questions and answers have been edited for clarity. Last names will not be used. Qualifying for CERB while overseas Diane in Montreal: I am a Canadian who was on a working holiday visa in Italy. I was meant to fly back this month but my flight was cancelled due to the virus. I have been in quarantine for approximately 40 days. I did earn more than $5,000 in Canada in 2019 and I am a resident of Canada. Moreover, I was coming back to Canada for the purpose of finding work and I already had some interviews lined up. I called [Canada Revenue Agency] on the phone to ask and the young lady seemed confused and then finally told me that I am eligible for Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) but she didn’t seem sure. Can you please let me know whether or not you think I am truly eligible for CERB? I fit all of the requirements except I got stuck in Italy during the time of the quarantine. (April 21, 2020) Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Wealth Advisory Service: To qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit you have to meet a number of conditions. First of all, you have to be at least 15 years of age. Second of all you must be a resident of Canada, so clearly, I think that you would be considered a resident of Canada for tax purposes. Thirdly, you have to have a minimum of $5,000 of employment income or self-employment income either in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to application to meet that criteria. Of course, the final criteria is that you must have stopped working and stopped earning employment or self-employment income as a direct result of COVID-19. Perhaps you were sick or you actually lost your job because your employer is basically no longer paying you as a result of COVID-19, or you’re taking care of a family member perhaps with COVID but again, I think this particular scenario would be problematic because I’m not sure if you actually lost your job, you don’t have a job, you’re not currently employed. The fact that you are looking for a job and you have some interviews right now, I’m not sure you would meet the technical conditions of losing your job as a result of COVID-19 or are technically unable to work. These are rules of course that are open to interpretation so again you may want to just check to confirm with the CRA or Service Canada to see whether or not they believe you qualify. (April 30, 2020) Should I apply for CERB or CESB? Tabitha in Hamilton, Ont.: I am a 20-year-old student living in Hamilton, Ont. I work at a restaurant which is now limited to take-out orders only. I informed my employer that until I feel safe again working at their business, I will be taking a temporary leave. My reason for doing this is because my mother is immune compromised. She has diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with stage four cancer. Obviously, I am not wanting to put her life at risk by me interacting with the public at my job. My employers are very understanding of my situation, and had no issue with my temporary leave. I have recently learned that those who voluntarily leave their work are not eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). At this time, I have received two automatic CERB payments. I am unsure if I am eligible to receive CERB now and I am wondering if I should apply for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) once it becomes available. I’m pretty sure I will qualify for the CESB, but I do not know if I can apply for it after already receiving two of the CERB payments. If I were to apply for the student benefit I would assume they would take the CERB payments back eventually; but if I am (unknowingly) eligible for CERB should I be risking it to apply for CESB? This whole situation is very confusing. As I am a student I have to think about the cost of tuition, books and living expenses beginning in September. I am concerned that because of my lack of hours this summer I will be unable to afford the things necessary for me to continue with my schooling. If you could provide any insight to this situation it would be greatly appreciated. (April 27, 2020) Jessica Moorhouse, financial counsellor and personal finance blogger for JessicaMoorhouse.com: This whole situation is very confusing, I agree! Let’s dive into your first question about whether or not you are in fact eligible for CERB. You’re correct that the criteria states that if you voluntarily quit your job you would become ineligible for the benefit (CERB). However, you did not quit your job, you are simply on temporary leave. On the government’s website, it states that you do not need to be laid off to access CERB, and can be eligible if you are still attached to your company (which you are). However, you did voluntarily request a leave of absence, and I suspect the criteria is saying that if you weren’t laid off from your job but your employer is no longer giving you shifts due to COVID-19, then you can get CERB. In your situation, it’s less clear if you would be eligible. I’m inclined to say you may not be. However, there is a new section on the government’s question and answers page that does address your situation of feeling uncomfortable continuing to work because you have someone at home with a compromised immune system. Unfortunately, it doesn’t give a simple yes or no answer and just re-iterates the original eligibility criteria (including that you cannot voluntarily quit your job) and suggests speaking with your employer about improving workplace safety. In terms of whether you should consider applying for CESB, since this benefit won’t be available until May and there is still very limited information and criteria on it, I would personally wait until there is more information about it before deciding. Since it is a benefit for students who are ineligible for CERB, if you are eligible for CESB, that means you will have to repay both CERB payments (most likely when you file your taxes next year). (April 28, 2020) Is there a clawback clause with CERB? Aidan from Surrey, B.C.: I'm interested in learning if the CERB has a clawback clause. In my case, for example, I'm being offered a few hours of work per week, which would take me over the $1,000 level of monthly income but under $2000 I would get from CERB. If I go over $1000, do I lose CERB totally or does the system claw back the overage amount from my $2000 benefit, allowing me to make more than the $2000 per month through a combination of income and benefit? Sorry for the rambling, stressful times. Thanks so much! (April 23, 2020) Robyn Thompson, personal finance expert and president of Castlemark Wealth Management Inc.: When submitting your first claim for the CERB, it’s important to understand you cannot have had more than $1,000 of employment income or self-employment income for 14 consecutive days or more during the four-week benefit period. Now for consecutive claims you cannot have more than $1,000 worth of income in the four-week benefit period. There is no such thing as a clawback provision, which means if you were to make say $1,500 from your employer, you would not be able to scale back the $500 to $1,000 and then apply for the CERB. Now on April 15, the government of Canada put proposed changes to the CERB which would allow more people to potentially qualify under the program. Specifically, these are people who make less than $1,000 a month; they could be students, part-time workers, perhaps contract workers, that need access to additional funds. Technically, they could earn up to $1,000 and then they could earn another $2,000 from the CERB if they qualify. The government of Canada continues to update eligibility requirements so check back on their website often to see if you qualify for the program at a different time. (April 29, 2020) Are negative interest rates likely? Bill in London, Ont.: Are negative interest rates even possible in Canada? How likely is it? Is it true that interest can be deducted from savings accounts?　 (April 27, 2020) Marc Goldfried, chief investment officer and head of fixed income at Canoe Financial: The Bank of Canada’s (BOC) main monetary policy tool is the ""overnight rate"". This rate is used to encourage or cool economic output and inflation. Lower rates encourage borrowing and expansion, while higher rates discourage borrowing and slow growth. Today it is at 0.25 per cent - the lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis. The BOC does have the ability to take that rate to negative territory similar to Japan and Europe. We believe there is a lower probability of this happening and that the Bank will look to use other tools to manage a greater slowdown than what is expected; however, it is possible. The rates that the government borrows at are known as the ""Government Bond and Treasury Bill Rates"". These tend to drop when there is slow growth and little inflation; and the opposite when growth is strong and inflation is picking up. They are live, actively traded and change minute by minute. Given the economic devastation that has occurred related to population containment because of COVID-19, there is very little in the way of higher inflation expectations. In that environment, we would expect government borrowing rates at most terms, to approach zero and potentially go negative.

85,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Katia Dmitrieva,America’s longest economic expansion is over — and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun,"GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low",-1,bad econ warrants lower interest rate,-1,,4/29/2020,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg,"The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF’s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency.In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.“This crisis is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. “Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.”As with the virus’s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.“Many countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,” the IMF said. “Risks of a worse outcome predominate.”The grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF’s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that “global growth appears to be bottoming out.” Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund’s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged “more dire scenarios” were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF’s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF’s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com"
89,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Reed Stevenson,Michael Burry of 'The Big Short' slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm,Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself,-1,bad econ warrants lower interest rate,0,,4/7/2020,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg,"Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country’s  deepest-ever economic contractions, aren’t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible.

6,Bloomberg News,Jill Ward,BOE cuts rate in second emergency move to combat virus shock,The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record-low 0.1 per cent and added 200 billion pounds (US$230 billion) to its asset-purchase program in its latest emergency action to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.,-1,global Central banks often act in tandem,-1,,3/19/2020,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/boe-cuts-rate-in-second-emergency-move-to-combat-virus-shock-1.1408901,,"The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record-low 0.1 per cent and added 200 billion pounds (US$230 billion) to its asset-purchase program in its latest emergency action to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The decision, just days into the tenure of new Governor Andrew Bailey, saw the central bank lower rates by 15 basis points and boost its quantitative easing target to 645 billion pounds. That increase will mainly be made up of extra gilt purchases, but will also include corporate buying, and will be completed as soon as operationally possible. In a conference call with reporters following the decision, Bailey said it was right to act now, rather than waiting for data to show the impact of the virus. He said the BOE’s actions reflected the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the pace of which was increasing very rapidly. The central bank still has more in the tank, he said. The pound extended gains after the announcement, rising as much as 1.6 per cent, before paring the advance to trade 0.4 per cent higher. At one stage on Wednesday, the currency tumbled as much as 5 per cent, dropping to the lowest since 1985. Bailey said that market moves had bordered on the disorderly in recent days and market pricing had been exacerbated by rumors of a London lockdown. Still, the BOE isn’t in favor of closing markets, he said. Meanwhile gilts rallied, with two year yields dropping 15 basis points to 0.20 per cent. The BOE also announced it was increasing the size of its Term Funding Scheme targeted at smaller businesses.  Lower Bound The central bank has previously indicated that 0.1 per cent is its effective lower bound for rates. While Bailey said Thursday that he’s not in favor of negative rates and has indicated previously that the BOE wants to avoid having to cut rates below zero to protect the banking system, he also said he would never rule anything out. “The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but temporary,” the BOE said in the statement. “The role of the Bank of England is to help to meet the needs of U.K. businesses and households in dealing with the associated economic disruption.” The Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favor of the latest surprise move. The BOE said it would start bond buying on March 20, when it intends to purchases 5.1 billion pounds of gilts. Buying will be at a “materially” faster pace than in the past, and the levels of purchases will vary based on market conditions, it said. It’s the latest in a string of emergency action from the BOE and its counterparts around the world, after Sunday night saw the bank unite with five global counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines. The Fed also cut rates to near zero and restarted its on QE program. The European Central Bank launched an 750 billion euro (US$820 billion) pandemic emergency debt-buying program Wednesday. That came on top of 120 billion euros in additional asset purchases agreed last week alongside measures to pump more liquidity into the financial system and to subsidize long-term loans for banks. Officials around the world are scrambling to respond to the spread of the coranavirus, which is forcing countries to shutter business and restrict travel. The problem for central banks is that they have already used much of the already-limited monetary-policy arsenal to fight the financial crisis, and have thus far failed to assuage concern among investors. The BOE’s latest action builds on a suite of measures from policy makers last week -- including a half point rate-cut to 0.25 per cent from 0.75 per cent and a new program to provide easy and cheap credit -- that came on a day of coordinated action with the U.K. Treasury. The government announced Tuesday that the BOE would provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper in an unlimited program which they aim to have operational by next week, a move Bailey said increases the BOE’s policy space."

There are about 20 more countries interested in support, Georgieva said.The fund also has about US$400 million in its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to help poor countries with debt relief. With the help of donations, like US$195 million recently from the U.K., the IMF hopes to boost that to US$1 billion, she said.“As the virus spreads, the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour,” Georgieva said. “During the global financial crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over US$900 billion in today’s money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.”Georgieva added that the IMF “stands ready to mobilize its US$1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership.” She praised the swap lines announced by central banks on Sunday, saying that going forward there may be a need for swap lines to emerging-market economies.The comments come after Georgieva said earlier this month that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” and that it’s still difficult to predict the economic impact of the virus. Meanwhile, the fund on Friday ordered all staff at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee was diagnosed with the virus. Bloomberg.com"

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a ‘long lasting’ epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks’ action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points.Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.“Global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. “We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.”With interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.“Central banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, ” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.The Bank of Japan backed up Monday’s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia’s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan’s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan’s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed’s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn’t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde’s comments of last week.“We are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closedFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That’s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world’s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won’t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they’re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.“Rate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,” said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011. Bloomberg.com"

Markets are pricing in a 50-per-cent chance the Fed will in fact cut rates when it makes its next decision March 18. “I think [the Fed] has a whole bunch of reasons why they can afford to cut,” Nathan Thooft,  head of Global Asset Allocation at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg Thursday.  “One, the market has priced it in, and two, two there aren’t any inflation concerns. Three, there is global weakness when it comes to growth dynamics.” “If the Fed cuts, I do think you’ll see other central banks follow through as well,” he added. “Will [the Fed] cut as an emergency outside of their meeting schedule? I’m a little more questionable on that one.”   Walsh also said the Fed should encourage other central banks to “take appropriate simultaneous action to loosen monetary policy in their jurisdictions.” “Global action would help make the most of scarce policy ammunition,” he wrote. In Canada, the Bank of Canada has bucked the global rate-cutting trend by maintaining its key interest rate at 1.75 per cent since October 2018.  The market is pricing in a 32-per-cent chance of a rate cut at its meeting next week."

Instead, investors are turning their attention to the country’s life insurers.In 2019, shares of Canada’s largest lenders gained 14 per cent, including dividends, lagging the S&P/TSX Composite’s 23 per cent total return — the first time they have trailed the benchmark since 2010. Banks have struggled to eke out strong earnings results as rising loan losses and eroding net interest margins hurt their profitability amid economic growth concerns. That pushed analysts to temper their forecasts for 2020.Life insurers, on the other hand, enjoyed a 40 per cent surge in 2019. Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. posted third-quarter profits last year that topped analysts’ expectations, as gains in Asia fuelled earnings growth.The banks were performing very well until September 2018, “and then the bloom went off the rose,” said John Kinsey, a portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Some investors have soured on banks because of concerns about declining interest rates, mortgage quality and high levels of consumer debt, which are a risk to the economy.“The focus changed to the insurers because they hadn’t done well when the banks were performing at their peak,” he said.“Lifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcome,” Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a Jan. 28 report. “As long as growth concerns for the banks remain intense, this trend could continue.”Lifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcomeWhen lifecos release fourth-quarter results next week, analysts are expecting them to show a strong finish to 2019. RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic expects they will report a “solid end to a good year with double-digit core EPS growth forecast for all of the lifecos,” reflecting strong equity market performance in the quarter.Investors are betting on insurers after taking a cautious view of the Canadian economy as it suffers a bout of sluggish growth. Traders are anticipating at least one Bank of Canada interest rate cut this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which could continue to hurt the bottom line for banks.Lower interest rates due to a potential economic downturn can also have a negative impact on insurers. But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.“The relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,” said National Bank’s Dechaine. He also expects them to prioritize share buybacks since several of the companies have “material amounts” of cash.Barclays analyst John Aiken raised his share price targets on Great-West, Manulife and Sun Life in a report last month and said his expectations reflect “strong profitability and an improving operating environment” heading into reporting season.As their shares rally, valuations for Canadian life insurers are almost on par with banks. The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group. Once Manulife is excluded, “the sector is trading inline to historical averages and to the Big Six,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

That’s probably the toxic mix for the downside risks to earnings estimates,” Martin Roberge, director of North American portfolio strategy at Canaccord Genuity, said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg on Tuesday. Despite signs of a stabilizing housing market, both mortgage loans and personal loans will be “constrained” by record-high consumer debt levels, Roberge wrote in a co-authored note to clients Tuesday, along with Canaccord’s Guillaume Arseneau and Anne-Katherine Milette. Commercial loan growth is also set to slow, which will further increase the banks’ loan-loss provisions, they wrote. Canaccord’s expectation for a decline in commercial lending comes as businesses face a backlog of inventory. “We have to clear what we believe is a major manufacturing glut, a retail [and] wholesale glut — and it will take about two quarters for Canadian corporations to clear that glut,” Roberge said. The country’s lenders will also face pressure when the Bank of Canada does “eventually cave in and cut rates,” the strategists wrote. Roberge sees the central bank cutting interest rates in the first half of the year which, he said, will further push lenders’ net-interest margins lower. In their note, the strategists wrote they see more opportunity in U.S. banks, citing a strong U.S. consumer and fourth-quarter earnings. But they caution U.S. banks are not without risks, including rapidly-falling bond yields weighing on net-interest margins.  Roberge added that despite this latest call on Canadian banks, Canaccord is not entirely bearish on the space. “This is not a ‘sell-all-your-banks’ call,” he said. “We’re just seeing better opportunities elsewhere.” “You really need to see prospects of a recession to become extremely negative on the banks. We’re not there yet.”"
36,Bloomberg News,Erik Hertzberg and Theophilos Argitis,Bank of Canada opens door to rate cut on persistent slowdown,"Stephen Poloz, one of the few central bankers to resist the global push toward easier monetary policy last year, said the door is open for the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates if the current economic slowdown persists.",-1,,-1,,1/22/2020,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bank-of-canada-opens-door-to-rate-cut-on-persistent-slowdown-1.1377893,,"Stephen Poloz, one of the few central bankers to resist the global push toward easier monetary policy last year, said the door is open for the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates if the current economic slowdown persists. The governor, speaking to reporters after a rate decision Wednesday that left the key interest rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent, said growing slack in the economy threatens to dampen inflation pressures. The central bank chose not to cut, however, because policy makers didn’t want to fuel household debt levels that remain a vulnerability to the economy. “I’m not saying that the door is not open to an interest rate cut, obviously it is, it is open,” Poloz said when pressed on the issue, adding borrowing costs remain “appropriate” for the time being. The more negative outlook is a departure from recent communications in which officials sought to accentuate the positives of an economy that had been running near capacity and was deemed resilient in the face of global uncertainty. Wednesday’s decision still leaves the Bank of Canada with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies, but the downturn in domestic economic data since the end of last year has clearly spooked policy makers. Canada’s currency sold off after the decision, depreciating as much as 0.6 per cent to $1.3146 against its U.S. counterpart at 12:33 p.m. Toronto time. Two-year government bond yields dropped 7 basis points to 1.58 per cent. Investors ramped up bets for rate cuts over the next year, with a move fully priced in over the next 12 months. On Tuesday, markets were pricing in a 50 per cent chance. Heightened Concern At its decision Wednesday, which kept rates steady for a 10th straight decision, the Bank of Canada expressed heightened concern about an economy that may have stalled in the fourth quarter. Policy makers revised near-term growth projections and expressed concern global weakness may be spreading to households, affecting domestic spending more than thought. They also seem to be entertaining the idea that underlying factors may be behind the slowdown, rather than temporary drivers. It’s a change in tone that reflects a shift in growth risks in recent months from global to domestic. Three months ago, the central bank was highlighting the nation’s resiliency to elevated international risks. Snce then domestic economic concerns have come to the forefront. “In determining the future path for the Bank’s policy interest rate, Governing Council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast,” policy makers said in the rate statement. “In assessing incoming data, the Bank will be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market, and business investment.”  The near-term slowdown coupled with a slight upward revision to potential growth prompted the central bank to increase its estimate for the amount of slack in the economy -- from about 0.25% of output in the third quarter to about 0.75 per cent. The bank also projected the economy will be in a state of excess capacity through the end of 2021. That build up in slack -- which bolsters the case for a rate cut -- is being weighed against the possibility that lower interest rates will fuel financial vulnerabilities, Poloz said at the press conference. All things considered, “it was Governing Council’s view that the balance of risks does not warrant lower interest rates at this time,” Poloz said. “Clearly, this balance can change over time as the data evolve.” The bank has been here before. In October, officials acknowledged they considered an “insurance” rate cut to counter growing risks associated with global trade tensions, ultimately deciding against it. Poloz indicated the motives for a future move would now be different. ‘Meaningful Shortfall’ If the bank cuts in the future, “it would not be a cut against a hypothetical or a possibility” rather it would mean that the forecast was showing a “meaningful shortfall on our inflation target,” he said. Even while cutting near-term forecasts, long-term estimates for growth were mostly unchanged from October, with a slightly lower growth forecast in 2020 of 1.6 per cent, but 2021 faster than previously forecast at two per cent. This suggests the base case scenario at the bank remains that the slowdown that began in the second half of last year will be temporary. The Bank of Canada anticipates that over the next two years household spending will pick up, helped in part by a recent tax cut, as will exports and business investment. It also anticipates inflation will stay around the  target over the projection horizon."

At a decision Wednesday, the bank is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 1.75 per cent, keeping it unchanged for a 10th-straight meeting and leaving Canada with the highest rate among advanced economies. Markets also don’t see much chance that Poloz, who leaves office in June, will lower borrowing costs in any of his final three meetings after this one, with odds of a cut at less than 40 per cent over that time. That’s despite having reason to cut, given the economy looks to have slowed sharply at the end of last year. Here are some of the reasons why he’s seen remaining on hold:  Neutral Tone In public appearances since October, officials have sought to accentuate the positive, highlighting the nation’s strong jobs market and on-target inflation. At the same time, they’ve been reluctant to put much stock in weaker indicators they say are transitory -- as Poloz did as recently as this month. Deputy Governor Timothy Lane defended of the Bank of Canada’s decision to buck the global easing trend, saying in December the nation’s resilient economy is allowing it to “chart its own course in monetary policy.” Inflation Underlying price pressure as measured by core inflation has been stable near the Bank of Canada’s two-per-cent target for about two years. That reflects an economy running nicely at about its capacity -- neither too hot nor too cold. Of course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it’s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than one per cent for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists. But the net effect of the changes isn’t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because of upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada. That means the economy probably had less slack to begin with. A weak fourth quarter also doesn’t mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front. Housing Rebound Officials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern. Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That’s one more reason not to cut. Elevated levels of household debt contributed to the governor’s decision to raise rates as much as he did, beginning in mid-2017. It wasn’t a popular move. The higher rates drove up the Canadian dollar, increased debt service ratios for millions of Canadians and even raised eyebrows in government circles. Which is why, having already endured the pain of hiking, Poloz may be even more wary of reversing that move. Core Mandate To be sure, Poloz won’t hesitate to cut if there’s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank’s primary inflation targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern. So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While the markets are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June. Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz’s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008. So did Gordon Thiessen in 2001. That said, as long as the economy remains in a relatively good place and household debt levels continue to pick up, Poloz may be content to simply stand pat before he stands down."

Debt from all sectors — ranging from household to government to corporate bonds — surged.“While borrowing costs remain very low, many countries are finding a debt-driven growth model increasingly difficult to maintain,” said Sonja Gibbs, managing director of global policy initiatives at the institute. “High and rising debt-to-GDP ratios are making debt service and refinancing more challenging, and the 2020s are likely to see a greater incidence of debt distress and restructuring.”The U.S. general government debt to GDP rose to about 102% of GDP, the IIF said, up 1.6 percentage points from a year earlier. Government debt in China grew at its fastest annual pace since 2009.The institute expects “low interest rates and loose financial conditions,” to push total global debt to exceed US$257 trillion in the first quarter of 2020.Government debt-to-GDP hit a new high in the U.S. and Australia.

The move followed a rare public rebuke earlier this month by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Just last week, Boeing said it would temporarily halt output of the Max, which has been grounded since March.Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith will serve as interim CEO during the brief transition period, Boeing said. Director Larry Kellner, who once led Continental Airlines, will replace Calhoun as chairman.Boeing’s directors voted unanimously to install Calhoun, 62, as CEO during an emergency session Sunday, said a person close to the board. Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith will serve as interim CEO during the brief transition period, the company said. Director Larry Kellner, who once led Continental Airlines, will replace Calhoun as chairman.Boeing is trying to regain its footing amid the Max grounding, one of the worst crises of the modern jet era. The planemaker’s reputation and finances have been battered after the Max disasters killed 346 people and prompted the worldwide grounding. Boeing’s design decisions and cozy relationship with the FAA are being scrutinized by Congress while the Justice Department is conducting a criminal probe.“A change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders,” Boeing’s board said.Boeing climbed 2.8 per cent to US$337.12 at 2:45 p.m. in New York after advancing as much as 3.8 per cent for the biggest intraday gain in six weeks.Calhoun, 62, a senior executive at Blackstone Group Inc., now faces the daunting task of extricating Boeing from one of the bleakest chapters in its 103-year history.Boeing is turning to a GE veteran to run the company for the third time in less than two decades, as the U.S. planemaker faces scrutiny for its unrelenting focus on shareholder value. The two CEOs who preceded Muilenburg — Jim McNerney and Harry Stonecipher — also rose through the ranks at GE while Jack Welch was chief executive.Calhoun had been in the running to head Boeing almost 15 years ago, when directors instead selected McNerney. Calhoun ran GE’s aircraft engines division from 2000 through 2004 and ascended to the vice chairman role before leaving the company in 2006.Affable and diplomatic, he’s also very connected. Calhoun serves on the Caterpillar Inc. board with Muilenburg and oversees Blackstone’s private equity portfolio.He will serve as a “stabilizer” as Boeing works itself out of the Max crisis, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with Teal Group.“There’s no doubt with Congress and regulators this is a lot better, and in the short run that matters a lot,” Aboulafia said.But in the longer term, Boeing faces daunting product-development decisions — starting with whether or when to replace the 737 Max — that will be difficult for a company outsider with no engineering background, Aboulafia said.“As long-term leader, GE plus private equity would appear to be not the right background given their needs right now,” he said of Calhoun.One of the criticisms of Muilenburg, an aerospace engineer who spent his entire career at Boeing, was his lack of experience running commercial aircraft programs. The former Boeing CEO ascended through the defence division.One of Calhoun’s first moves Monday was to reach out to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to discuss the leadership transition at Boeing, said a personfamiliar with the call who wasn’t authorized to speak about it.“We expect that Boeing will support that process by focusing on the quality and timeliness of data submittals for FAA review, as well as being transparent in its relationship with the FAA as safety regulator,” the agency said by email.Muilenburg’s departure caps an extraordinary fall from grace for an Iowa farmer’s son who had dreamed of turning Boeing into a globally admired corporate paragon, much as Welch did for GE. For two years as CEO, Muilenburg seemed to have the Midas touch. Then a brand-new Lion Air 737 Max plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, 2018.While the plane’s design was largely set before Muilenburg became CEO, he bore responsibility for the company’s initial muted response — and the media firestorm that ensued when a second Max crashed less than five months later in Ethiopia. He would later describe the Max tragedies as the most difficult moments of a career spanning more than three decades, all at Boeing.Muilenburg, 55, joined the company from Iowa State University as an intern in 1985. Over the next three decades, the aerospace engineer rose to increasingly prominent positions at the defence business of the Chicago-based manufacturer. As head of the division, he drove deep cuts to maintain profits when Pentagon spending was stagnant.He succeeded McNerney as CEO in mid-2015 amid the biggest sales boom in aviation history, fuelled by low interest rates, readily available financing and the rapid expansion of low-cost airlines, particularly in Asia. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner started generating cash months after Muilenburg took office, after a decade of losses. The plane, along with the highly profitable 737, funded the increasingly generous returns the company lavished on investors.An avid cyclist fuelled by diet Mountain Dew, the whip-thin Muilenburg brought an unapologetic, hard-charging edge to Boeing. “Compete to win,” became a company mantra. He demanded deeper discounts from suppliers while creating new businesses that poached sales from its partners in everything from cockpit electronics to the mini jet engines housed in an aircraft’s tail.The efforts helped turn Boeing into the most valuable U.S. industrial company, surpassing GE’s dimming star, as the planemaker’s market capitalization surged past US$200 billion. Under Muilenburg, Boeing’s shares more than tripled through early 2019, far outpacing the broader market.But the hard-nosed approach came back to haunt Boeing and its CEO. Responding to a preliminary accident report about the Lion Air crash, the company infuriated the carrier, one of its largest Max customers, by highlighting maintenance miscues on the doomed aircraft.Boeing shocked pilots around the world after the accident when it revealed that an obscure flight-control subsystem known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System played a role in the accident.While the company had described MCAS to Max operators, it had removed references from flight-crew manuals. The Lion Air pilots had no knowledge of the system, which was tripped by an erroneous sensor reading and then shoved the plane’s nose down more than 20 times until they lost control.Regulators worldwide began grounding the Max hours after the March crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, even as Boeing’s leaders and the FAA stood by the plane and recommended more investigation before taking action. In the aftermath, Muilenburg sent a message to employees saying he was “confident in the safety of the 737 Max.”His tone changed over the following weeks and months. “We’ve learned from both of these accidents,” Muilenburg said in an interview in September. “We’re humbled, and learning, but we’re also confident. We know we have a great company with great people.”It wasn’t enough.Boeing’s problems snowballed as additional problems arose and regulators expanded their review of the Max beyond MCAS. There was the revelation that a cockpit light that might have alerted the crews to the sensor malfunction was inoperable in most Max jets because of a coding error. While Boeing had known of the issue for more than a year, it didn’t alert the FAA or airlines until after the Lion Air crash.As the grounding dragged on, Boeing faced the logistical challenge of storing hundreds of factory-fresh planes while keeping cash-strapped suppliers afloat. Fairly or not, the company’s laser focus on cash and costs reinforced a narrative that it had been lax on safety.The leadership change was lauded by Michael Stumo, the father of Samya Stumo, who died on the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10. She was the grand niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader.Michael Stumo called the crash “preventable” and said Boeing now needs to clean house on its board.“Mr. Muilenburg’s resignation is a good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation,” Stumo said in a statement. “Now that it’s known what he and top Boeing officials knew, yet ignored, prior to the crashes, it has become clear how the company eroded in quality over the years.”–With assistance from Alan Levin.Bloomberg.com"
44,Bloomberg News,Theophilos Argitis,Poloz sees era of low global interest rates amid 'structural forces',Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he expects global interest rates to remain low for years to come due to the effects of structural forces such as sluggish productivity and population growth.,-1,,-1,,12/12/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/poloz-sees-era-of-low-global-interest-rates-amid-structural-forces-1.1361812,,"Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he expects global interest rates to remain low for years to come due to the effects of structural forces such as sluggish productivity and population growth. In his final speech of the year, Poloz stepped back from near-term issues to focus on long-term forces acting on the economy, and laid out some specific areas the Bank of Canada expects to work on in 2020. “On balance, it looks like the global economy is set for continued slow economic growth for mostly structural reasons” over a period of years, said Poloz, according to prepared remarks of speech in Toronto. He noted he’s not making any “near-term prediction” on Canadian policy, other than to say the economy is running close to capacity. “I am talking about structural forces acting on the global economy,” he said. “In this era, it looks like interest rates are likely to fluctuate around historically low levels.” Poloz said structural factors have been responsible for the disappointing economic growth that has occurred since the 2008 recession. At the same, despite the potential for technology to boost economic efficiency, near-term risks to productivity growth are tilted to downside because of trade tensions, Poloz said. “This means that low interest rates are likely to persist,” he said. One consequence of interest rates remaining low is that debt may continue to rise as a share of the economy, both at the household and government level. That makes economies more vulnerable to shocks. Too Complacent Poloz also cautioned against being too complacent about inflation, at a time when some are proposing potentially inflationary solutions to fix structural problems. He invoked the examples of the “Great Inflation of the 1970s,” when high debt levels and excessive monetary expansion led to a surge in prices, and said those lessons seem to be fading “from our collective memory.” “Perhaps the recent tendency for inflation to run below target in many countries has fostered a degree of complacency,” Poloz said. “The risk of a surprise outbreak in global inflation is low, but it seems to be that the combination of elevated household and government indebtedness and populist politics holds inflationary potential for some countries.” He was particularly critical of Modern Monetary Theory -- the notion that governments should issue as much newly issued money as needed to keep economies growing. “This sounds like Modern Monetary Theory is offering a free lunch, and most of us know there is no such thing,” Poloz said. Canada is fortunate to have an inflation target that addresses such risks “directly,” Poloz said. He added a renewal of the mandate is one of the main things the central bank will work on next year, along with studying: • How to embed financial stability linkages in the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy framework by refining core economic forecasting models. Financial stability issues could alter the horizon over which inflation is brought back to target • How to better assess the impact of artificial intelligence and digitalization on financial stability and the economy. “In 2020, the bank will be working hard on new ways to detect and determine the economic impact of the fourth industrial revolution.” • The potential impacts of digital money, including whether it should issue currency in digital form and how to think about emerging payment currencies --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg."
46,Bloomberg News,Reade Pickert,U.S. core inflation modest in November,"A key measure of U.S. consumer prices remained subdued in November, bolstering widespread expectations Federal Reserve policy makers will hold the line on interest rates.",0,likely maintain current interest rate,0,,12/11/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-core-inflation-modest-in-november-1.1360973,,"A key measure of U.S. consumer prices remained subdued in November, bolstering widespread expectations Federal Reserve policy makers will hold the line on interest rates. The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 per cent for a second month, and 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. Those figures matched the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The broader CPI increased 0.3 per cent, and 2.1 per cent from November 2018. The contained pace of inflation supports forecasts that the Fed will hold interest rates steady when policy makers convene this afternoon. Central bankers have cut borrowing costs three times this year and signaled they will remain on hold for the near future or until the economic outlook shows a material change. The Labor Department’s CPI tends to run higher than the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed officially targets. The core PCE index that policy makers watch for a better read on underlying price trends has softened in recent months and has held below the two per cent objective all year. What’s more, consumers expect minimal price pressures over the longer term. The University of Michigan's measure long-term inflation expectations matched a record low in the preliminary December survey. The Labor Department’s CPI report showed energy and shelter were the primary factors boosting November inflation. Energy prices rose 0.8 per cent from the prior month on the back of higher gasoline and fuel oil costs. Shelter costs, which make up about a third of total CPI, accelerated, rising 0.3 per cent last month after a 0.1 per cent gain in October. The price of lodging rose 1.1 per cent after slumping 3.8 per cent a month earlier. Owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories that tracks rental prices, increased 0.2 per cent. Food prices edged up 0.1 per cent, while the cost of new vehicles declined for a fifth consecutive month. Apparel prices, which tend to be volatile on monthly basis, crept up 0.1 per cent in November after declining the previous two months. A separate Labor Department report Wednesday showed average hourly earnings, adjusted for price changes, rose 1.1 per cent in November from a year earlier after a 1.4 per cent in the 12 months through October. Higher inflation erodes wage gains. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast the core CPI to rise 0.2 per cent from the prior month and 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, with the broader index seen rising 0.2 per cent and two per cent on a yearly basis."

According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country’s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent in the prior period.It’s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation’s households cope with high debt levels.Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn’t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That’s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January.Canada’s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they’ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3 per cent since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased 1 per cent in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal.You don't have a domestic demand story that's strongBusiness investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada’s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures.Consumption has long propelled Canada’s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that’s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigour is most apparent in a retail sector that’s seen volumes flat over the past year.“You don’t have a domestic demand story that’s strong,” said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.One bright spot in the GDP numbers could be housing, which has rebounded as borrowing costs decline and buyers adjust to tighter mortgage rules. Home sales rose 7.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest quarterly pace since the end of 2017. Most economists estimate residential investment picked up for a second straight quarter.Bloomberg.com"

The index from Citigroup Inc. — which falls when data prove worse than forecast — dropped below zero on Tuesday, for the first time since December. It indicates that Canada’s growth might be slowing down at a faster pace than what analysts expect, fuelled by trade war concerns. The Canadian dollar has also weakened against the greenback this month, making it one of the worst currencies against its Group of 10 counterparts. The negative reading follows a series of disappointing economic reports this month including jobs, trade and housing starts, giving economists some pause on the extent of the country’s deceleration. Manufacturing numbers Tuesday, the most recent release from Canada’s federal statistics agency, were also weak. Despite a better-than-expected headline result, factory volumes and inventories declined. While the nation’s economy is nowhere near peak growth, the data so far this year have been strong enough to keep the Bank of Canada from cutting interest rates, making it an outlier among other major central banks. But a slew of bad data may provide the central bank with more ammunition if it decides to lower borrowing costs at its next meeting on Dec. 4. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the economy to decelerate to a yearly pace of 1.5 per cent in 2019 and 2020, in line with expectations for slower global growth.  --With assistance from Divya Balji and Chris Middleton."
57,Bloomberg News,Jesse Hamilton and Rich Miller,Fed warns prolonged low interest rates could spark instability,"Continuing low interest rates could dent U.S. bank profits and push bankers into riskier behavior that might threaten the nation’s financial stability, the Federal Reserve said in a report released Friday.",1,Fed intends to hike rate,-1,,11/15/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-warns-prolonged-low-interest-rates-could-spark-instability-1.1348808,,"Continuing low interest rates could dent U.S. bank profits and push bankers into riskier behavior that might threaten the nation’s financial stability, the Federal Reserve said in a report released Friday. The latest version of the twice-yearly report, meant to flag stability threats on the Fed’s radar, highlighted the rate squeeze facing banks and insurers, noting that it could erode lending standards. “If interest rates were to remain low for a prolonged period, the profitability of banks, insurers, and other financial intermediaries could come under stress and spur reach-for-yield behavior, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the financial sector to subsequent shocks,” the U.S. central bank said in the report. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested to lawmakers on Thursday that low interest rates might be a permanent part of the economic landscape. “We’re in a world of much lower interest rates,” he told members of the House Budget Committee. “That seems to be driven by long-run structural things and there’s not a lot of reason to think that will change.’ Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a statement Friday that the low-for-long environment “and the associated incentives to reach for yield and take on additional debt could increase financial vulnerabilities.” Repo Market The bulk of the work on the report was done before September’s repo market tumult, which prompted the Fed to pump reserves into the banking system to boost money market liquidity. Still, the report does briefly address problems with the short-term repurchase agreements. “Pressures in the repo market spilled over to other markets, including the federal funds market,” the report said. “The Federal Reserve took a number of steps beginning in mid-September to maintain the federal funds rate within its target range and to ensure an ample supply of reserves. Pressures in short-term funding markets subsequently abated.” The central bank appeared to take a more relaxed view of the rising stock market than it did in its last report in May. While equity prices remain high relative to corporate earnings, they are consistent with the low level of interest rates, the Fed said. “Over the past couple of years, equity prices have been high relative to forecasts of corporate earnings,” according to the report. “However, other measures of investors’ risk appetite in domestic equity markets are in the middle of their historical ranges.” Futures Markets The report also flagged a deterioration in liquidity in U.S. Treasury and equity futures markets. Its detailed analysis of the two markets found that while liquidity in Treasury futures hasn’t become more fragile, the same couldn’t be said for shares. For equity futures, “liquidity has become more fragile over time,” the report said. “It tends to disappear when it is needed the most, when asset price volatility is high.” Dealers surveyed by the Fed agreed that liquidity in stock futures deteriorated and became more fragile since January 2018. Among other factors, they cited a decreased willingness of intermediaries to step into the market when it became more volatile. Other points raised in the report include historically high debt loads at U.S. businesses, high leverage at hedge funds and potential near-term stresses from Brexit. “Should a no-deal Brexit cause distress in systemically important financial institutions in Europe, it would amplify the transmission of economic disturbances to U S and global financial systems,“ the Fed said."
69,Bloomberg News,Christopher Condon and Chris Middleton,U.S. Fed seen cutting rates next week and then hitting pause button,"Federal Reserve officials will signal they’re likely to take a break from cutting interest rates after lowering them again next week, according to a majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.",-1,cut rate next week,0,,10/25/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-fed-seen-cutting-rates-next-week-and-then-hitting-pause-button-1.1337289,,"Federal Reserve officials will signal they’re likely to take a break from cutting interest rates after lowering them again next week, according to a majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. In an Oct. 21-24 poll of 40 economists, 85 per cent said they anticipate the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates by a quarter percentage point when it wraps up a two-day meeting in Washington on Wednesday. That would lower the target range for the Fed’s benchmark rate to 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent. In addition, 56 per cent of respondents said in the event of such a cut, policy makers would telegraph, either in their policy statement or through Chairman Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference, that they are likely to pause for some time before making another rate move. “It might well be a hawkish cut as Powell will likely signal some resistance to cut rates more,” said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva. The Fed has already lowered rates twice this year — in July and September — not because officials forecast a steep downturn but because the risks of such a slump have mounted. Powell last month compared that to taking out “insurance.” Though U.S. unemployment is low, hiring strong and consumer spending solid, he cited slowing global growth, uncertainty around trade tensions and below-target inflation as reasons to nudge rates lower.  THREE AND DONE Coming out of this meeting, the big questions will center on whether Powell and other key policy makers believe three, quarter-point cuts represent enough insurance. Even if that is the case, there’s no guarantee Powell will say so. At his September press conference, Powell shied away from providing any signal on future rates despite repeated questioning. “The Fed is refraining from providing forward guidance, saying rate decisions are on a meeting-by-meeting basis,” said Kathleen Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “However, if the Fed intends to pause its rate cuts at the December meeting, look for Chair Powell to provide some signal in his press conference.” REMAINING UNCERTAINTY Not all the economists agreed. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, said he expected no such signal because the uncertainties the Fed has used to justify rate cuts haven’t abated. “China and the U.S. haven’t come to an agreement, Europe is still slow and weak, and Brexit isn’t done,” he said. “They can’t put a floor under this, because that would argue they’ve already done enough to fix the uncertainty, or that the uncertainty is gone, and it’s not gone.” According to their median projections, respondents expect the Fed will lower rates once more in 2020. That’s roughly in line with investors. Pricing in fed funds futures implies an expectation for another roughly 40 basis points in easing by the end of 2020. A separate question showed economists nonetheless seeing significant risks to the U.S. economy. As a group they assigned a 30 per cent median probability that the Fed will cut rates all the way to zero before the end of next year. T-BILL PURCHASES Most respondents said they expect the Fed will find sufficient supply in outstanding Treasury bills to execute a new plan aimed at smothering volatility in overnight funding markets. The Fed announced Oct. 11 that it would initially buy US$60 billion a month in bills to increase the level of bank reserves. Just under a quarter, however, said the Fed will be forced to add some purchases of coupon-bearing short-dated Treasuries to reach their target. AVERAGE INFLATION Asked about the Fed’s ongoing policy framework review, just 11 per cent said they expect the Fed will formally adopt an inflation-targeting strategy known as average-inflation targeting. A much larger group of 43 per cent said officials will instead alter the language in their annual policy strategy statement to include a reference to hitting their inflation target on average. Another 22 per cent said officials will drop the fixed-point inflation target for a range. The Fed has failed for most of the last eight years to bring inflation up to its two-per-cent objective. Officials have contemplated a new policy that would require overshooting the target for some time to make up for periods of undershooting."

The forecast for this year would be the weakest since 2009, when the world economy shrank, as the fund chopped projections from the U.S. and Europe to China and India.“With a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery, the global outlook remains precarious,” IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote in the report. “There is no room for policy mistakes and an urgent need for policy makers to cooperatively de-escalate trade and geopolitical tensions.”The latest dimming of the outlook, just before annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington this week, reflects the economic costs of higher tariffs. Officials from around the world will convene as President Donald Trump’s trade policies remain one of the biggest global threats. Investors are awaiting more clarity on whether a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks last week will ease global uncertainties.The global growth estimate for 2019 was as high as 3.9 per cent in mid-2018. The IMF cited subdued economic momentum and weaker investment, slashing its estimate for the growth in trade volume to a “near standstill” pace of just 1.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent last year, though it also sees a pickup to 3.2 per cent in 2020.The IMF report said “risks seem to dominate the outlook,” but recent monetary easing in many countries “could lift demand more than projected, especially if trade tensions between the U.S. and China ease and a no-deal Brexit is averted.”Those threats and others have prompted warnings from both leaders of the global institutions as new leadership takes over. Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, previously World Bank chief executive officer, took over as IMF chief Oct. 1, succeeding Christine Lagarde. World Bank President David Malpass was selected in April.Georgieva painted a downbeat picture in her first major address last week, saying a deeper slowdown could require coordinated fiscal stimulus. She has said her first priority is to help member nations lower the risk of crises and cope with potential downturns.Business leaders are more circumspect too. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also took a cautious tone on the global economy Tuesday, calling out trade tensions and geopolitical issues as the bank reported its third-quarter earnings.IMF economists dimmed their views across the largest economies. The fund cut its U.S. 2019 growth estimates by 0.2 percentage point to 2.4 per cent, but raised it by the same margin to 2.1 per cent next year.Euro-area growth was reduced this year and next, to 1.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent. Estimates for Germany, France, Italy and Spain were lowered for both years. This year’s U.K. growth forecast was reduced to 1.2 per cent. China projections were reduced for both years, to 6.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively.The IMF says continued policy support in major economies and stabilization in some stressed emerging economies are expected to lift growth modestly over the rest of 2019 and into 2020.“The world economy faces difficult headwinds,” the outlook said. “Despite the recent decline in long-term interest rates creating more fiscal room, the global environment is expected to be characterized by relatively limited macroeconomic policy space to combat downturns and weaker trade flows, in part reflecting the increase in trade barriers and anticipated protracted trade policy uncertainty.”Bloomberg.com"

Of the eight “financial-market surprises” published by Standard Chartered Plc, two have effectively materialized, while three more still remain possible.Coming True:The Federal Reserve cutting interest rates (Done so twice, with another one priced in).The European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing (By 20 billion euros per month from November).Still in Play:The U.S. and China reach an agreement to weaken the dollar (Officials looking at rolling out currency pact).The U.S. Treasury tries to sell 50-year bonds (May do so next year if there is appetite).The U.K. faces a hard Brexit and the pound falls to parity with the dollar (Talks still currently taking place, though optimism is sparse).Looking Unlikely:Hong Kong abandons its dollar currency peg (Traders including Hayman Capital Management’s Kyle Bass are betting unrest will spur capital flight, but it hasn’t happened).OPEC breaks up and Brent crude falls to US$25 a barrel (Supply deficit is at its widest level in years).Japan monetizes the national debt, the yen climbs to 80 per dollar (JPMorgan sees the yen as the “only cheap recessionary hedge” remaining).Standard Chartered aren’t the only ones who had a punt. Saxo Bank A/S published their “10 Outrageous Predictions” for 2019 in December, including one that called a German recession. By most accounts, Europe’s largest economy may be in one already. There is no sign of some of the others — including a solar flare creating chaos and a global transportation tax.Neither bank predicted a US$17 trillion pile of negative-yielding debt — bonds guaranteed to lose investors’ money if held to maturity — a meltdown in the U.S. repo market, or a drone attack on a Saudi oil facility.

80,BNN Bloomberg,Michelle Zadikian,Lower rates giving Canadian housing 'nine lives': CIBC's Tal,"If the Canadian housing market had a spirit animal, a cat could be fitting.",0,reflects current low rate,-1,,9/20/2019,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/lower-rates-giving-canadian-housing-nine-lives-cibc-s-tal-1.1319445,,"If the Canadian housing market had a spirit animal, a cat could be fitting. Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, says global and domestic developments that have led to lower interest rates have continually buoyed Canadian housing at times when it was poised to soften. “The housing market has nine lives. Every time it’s supposed to slow down, something bad happens elsewhere that keeps interest rates low and the party’s still going,” Tal told BNN Bloomberg in a Friday interview.   An increasing number of economists are now forecasting the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates as the U.S.-China trade war takes a toll on the global economic outlook – a move that would provide yet another boost to the Canadian housing market and threaten to blunt the impact of government measures, such as the B-20 mortgage rules. Tal adds that he believes the Bank of Canada prefers to avoid fuelling the housing market through lower rates, but trade pressures and monetary policy easing by central banks around the world might force its hand. “That’s something the Bank of Canada would like to avoid. However you have to look at the economy as a whole and housing is only one part of it,” he said. “The consumer is not there, clearly investment is not there, exports are missing in action and the only thing that’s moving is actually the housing market again.” Tal says the central bank will have to weigh the pros and cons of a rate reduction, but ultimately believes Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will follow suit with his fellow central bankers. “So they will have to do the balancing and say, ‘Okay, maybe housing will go a little bit higher.’ But given where we are, given where the economy is, given where the Canadian dollar might be going if we’re not moving, they will have to make this decision. “Our forecast is that they will cut by 25 basis points and will call it a day.”"

A manufacturing slump around the world is hammering growth in export powerhouses China and Germany.“A negative supply shock like this, when global growth is in a synchronized slowdown with many geopolitical hotspots simmering, is just what we don’t need,” said Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.The oil shock comes amid a flurry of warning signs for the global economy. Data Monday out of China included the worst single-month reading for industrial output since 2002. In July, the International Monetary Fund reduced its global growth outlook — already the lowest since the financial crisis — to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next; a rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009.The impact from the oil-price spike will vary around the world.Emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits — like India, South Africa and others — run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies.Exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues, while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump, potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand. As the world’s biggest importer of oil, China is vulnerable to rising crude prices, while many countries in Europe also rely on imported energy.With inflation not an immediate concern in the global economy, the bigger worry is the effect a price shock will have on global demand that’s already weak.“Inflation is not really an issue at the moment,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. “But the production shortage and price increase will choke purchasing power and thus weigh on spending at a precarious moment for the global economy.”An IMF analysis in 2017 found that a one-year, one-standard-deviation shock to oil supply — in which the oil price jumps more than 10 per cent — would erode world output by about 0.1 per cent for two years.The news from Saudi Arabia boosts the chance of additional monetary policy support from central banks in anticipation of higher energy costs that are effectively a tax on consumers, David Mann, chief economist for Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television.“We would argue this adds to the reasons why we are going to see more dovish surprises from central banks over the next few weeks,” Mann said.The Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates again this week and their meeting will be followed by the Bank of Japan, which is under pressure from investors to loosen monetary policy further. Central banks of Brazil, South Africa, Norway, Switzerland and the U.K. will also decide policy this week.In a hint of how emerging economy officials may react, Philippine central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said the price shock will figure into policy makers’ discussions when they meet next week to decide interest rates. Bank Indonesia has a policy meeting scheduled Thursday, with the majority of economists surveyed before the Saudi attack predicting a 25 basis-point rate cut.“A significant spike in oil prices is the last thing the world economy needs now,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.Bloomberg.com"

Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have created an index to gauge the impact of Donald Trump’s tweets on U.S. interest rates, which they say is on the rise.The ‘Volfefe Index,’ named after Trump’s mysterious ‘covfefe’ tweet, suggests that the president’s tweets are having a statistically significant impact on Treasury yields. The number of market-moving Trump tweets has ballooned in the past month, with those including words such as ‘China,’ ‘billion,’ ‘products,’ ‘democrats,’ and ‘great,’ most likely to affect prices, the analysts found.“Trade and monetary policy have become an increasing focus for the executive branch, and everything from casual sentiments to seemingly formal policy intentions have been disseminated, globally and instantaneously, via this carefully scrutinized social media platform,” analysts led by Josh Younger and Munier Salem wrote. “In response, a broad swath of assets from single-name stocks to macro products have found their price dynamics increasingly beholden to a handful of tweets from the commander in chief.”The president has averaged roughly 10 tweets a day since the start of 2016, with 10,000 tweets occurring after his inauguration in 2017, according to JPMorgan’s analysis. Trump’s Twitter activity reached a low of five tweets per day heading into his official inauguration, but has picked up substantially since late 2018 — with his highest number of tweets in the past four years occurring in recent months.JPMorgan’s analysis looked at Treasury yields in the five minutes after a Trump tweet, and the index shows the rolling one-month probability that each missive is market-moving.They found that the Volfefe Index can account for a “measurable fraction” of moves in implied volatility, seen in interest rate derivatives known as swaptions. That’s particularly apparent at the shorter end of the curve, with two- and five-year rates more impacted than 10-year securities.JPMorgan isn’t alone in attempting to calculate the impact of the president’s Twitter activity on markets. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch published a note last week concluding that days where President Trump tweets relatively frequently tend to see negative returns of 9 basis points on average. Days with fewer presidential tweets tend to see positive returns of 5 basis points on average.Still, the S&P 500 is up more than 35 per cent since Trump won the 2016 election.Bloomberg.com"

But he’s also spending a lot of time outlining policies to stave it off.Speaking to reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office, Trump said he’s open to a range of possible actions, including a payroll tax cut or bypassing Congress to reduce taxes by indexing capital gains. He repeated his demand that the Federal Reserve slash interest rates to bolster the economy. Yet he also suggested those actions aren’t necessary.“We’re very far from a recession,” Trump said.His comments Tuesday illustrate the balance the White House is trying to strike between touting growth under the Trump administration and laying the groundwork for possible fiscal stimulus if the economy falters.With the 2020 campaign heating up, the growing odds of an economic contraction threaten to crush Trump’s hopes for a second term. Chances of a recession within the next year have risen to 35 per cent, according to an August survey of economists by Bloomberg News.Trump also defended his trade war with China — a dispute economists point to as a primary risk for global economic growth. He called any short-term pain the U.S. has to pay from the trade war “irrelevant.”“My life would be a lot easier if I hadn’t taken China on,” Trump said. “But I like doing it because I have to do it.”Economic trends tend to predict election outcomes, and recessions can be radioactive for the party in power. In the last century, the only elected presidents who lost re-election did so after overseeing a recession — George H.W. Bush in 1992, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Herbert Hoover in 1932.For Trump, the economy may be even more important than for his predecessors. His low-40s approval rating is already perilous for an incumbent, and the economy is the main factor keeping him afloat. He scores poorly on most other policy issues and on questions of leadership and character.“I think the word recession is a word that’s inappropriate ’cause it’s just a word that certain people — I’m going to be kind, certain people and the media are trying to build up, because they’d love to see a recession,” Trump said Tuesday.Yet, when asked about the economy, the president said he and his advisers have discussed “all types of options,” including the payroll tax cut, which supports Social Security and Medicare.“We’re looking at various tax reductions” but the White House does that “all the time,” he said. “I’m not talking about doing anything at this moment.”My life would be a lot easier if I hadn't taken China on. But I like doing it because I have to do itWhite House officials say the president has decided against cutting payroll taxes for now. One person familiar with the internal discussions said the idea had been floated by Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, but that even the suggestion of it had caused others to bristle. They said it would send a message to the outside world that the administration is worried about the state of an economy that Trump continues to insist is strong.While the president remains bullish, he and his economic advisers have been casting about for ways to cut taxes to foster growth amid troubling signs. Business investment is cooling and manufacturing has weakened. U.S. factory activity deteriorated in July to an almost three-year low, according to the latest figures from the Institute for Supply Management.This isn’t the first time Trump has suggested sweeping tax cuts while facing political headwinds. Before the mid-term elections last fall, he floated a 10 per cent middle class tax cut — much to the surprise of his own aides and allies in Congress. He never released any specifics about the cut, and after Republicans lost control of the House in the election, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the idea was no longer being pursued.Any new Trump tax cut plan is not likely to be welcomed on Capitol Hill. The Constitution mandates that tax legislation originate in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi will refuse to consider bills that could buoy the re-election chances of the president and his party.Even congressional Republicans are hesitant to put forward tax cut legislation, worried that would suggest that the economy is faltering heading into the 2020 campaign season.“At this point, recession seems more of a political wish by Democrats than an economic reality,” Michael Zona, a spokesman for Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in an email.Major tax cuts all require congressional approval, but Trump, along with top advisers including Kudlow, believe that he can index capital gains to inflation without Congress, a move that would cut taxes for investors. White House officials are looking at using an executive order to direct the Treasury Department to issue regulations adjusting the original purchase price of an asset — such as a stock or real estate — upward with inflation, minimizing the “gain” on which an investor is taxed.Treasury Department officials are skeptical that this can be done without Congress and are concerned it could face legal challenges.Such an action would also do little to stave off a potential slowdown or curry favour with voters. Indexing capital gains would only expand the economy by about 0.11 per cent in the long-run, according to the Tax Foundation. And very few people outside the top 5 per cent of earners, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, have capital gains income allowing them to to take advantage of the break.Bloomberg.com"

It hasn’t been that inverted since December 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on daily closing levels.Traders have increased wagers on rates cuts since last week even as inflation remains close to the Bank of Canada’s target of 2 per cent and the economy continues to grow. But there’s mounting speculation that the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs again as soon as next month, and traders are wondering if the BoC will be able to go against the tide.“The inversion is saying that eventually the central bank will roll over,” and cut rates, said Ryan Goulding, a fixed-income manager at Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel Ltd., which manages about $21 billion (US$15.8 billion), including Canadian government bonds.Investors in Canadian fixed-income assets are betting Governor Stephen Poloz can’t keep rates on hold indefinitely as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated.While traders still see a limited chance of a rate cut in the next two months, the market is signalling it sees the BOC target at 1.43 per cent in six months, from 1.75 per cent now, data compiled by Bloomberg show.With Canada’s markets catching up to Monday’s events after being shut for a holiday, the nation’s 10-year yield sank 14 basis points Tuesday to 1.24 per cent, the lowest since November 2016.“The market has started to price in a rate cut by the Bank of Canada in December or earlier next year,” said Dominique Lapointe, an economist at Laurentian Bank Securities.Bloomberg.com"

Excluding motor vehicles and gasoline, the drop was even more pronounced, at 1 per cent.The report runs against the broader narrative of a rebounding Canadian economy, and is an arrow in the quiver for those who believe the central bank will eventually need to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates.Friday’s retail sales data may heighten concern about the degree to which debt service costs, which are close to the highest since the financial crisis, are eating into disposable income, and call into question how much Canada can continue to rely on consumers to fuel new economic growth. In volume terms, which strip out the effects of price changes, sales were down 0.5 per cent on the month and 1 per cent on the year. Tempering the negativity, retail sales rose in the three most-populous cities — Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The statistics agency also noted its “trading-day adjustment,” where it accounts for the number of heavier shopping days in a calendar month, may have skewed the May results to the downside.

That’s precisely the kind of perverse reaction Poloz finds disconcerting.An escalation in trade tensions looks to be on the minds of bond investors, but stocks are shrugging off this possibility, according to Canada’s central bank chief.“To put a fine point on it, the bond market pushes yields down and the stock market goes back as if nothing bad’s going to happen,” he said. “And yet the underlying shock would be clearly very bad for economic growth, would be bad for the level of productivity, would be quite harmful to profitability.”The Bank of Canada left its policy rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent, citing ongoing trade uncertainty hindering growth, despite a rebound in recent economic data. The Monetary Policy Report released by the central bank shed further light on these mixed signals sent by financial markets.The inversion of the Canadian and U.S. yield curves may be benign, but “nonetheless reflect a concern about the prospects for growth,” according to policy makers. On the other hand, “robust equity prices and tight credit spreads suggest that economic growth will continue in the near term.”Bloomberg.com"

European governments turned to the 63-year old onetime lawyer and former French finance minister on Tuesday after hours of negotiations over a package of top EU jobs.In moving from Washington to Frankfurt, Lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19-nation economy which Draghi has already signalled will need more help, likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing. Inflation is running at barely half the ECB’s goal of just under 2 per cent despite years of negative rates and 2.6 trillion euros (US$3 trillion) of bond purchases.Investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis-fighter, Lagarde will share Draghi’s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy, especially as her appointment means the more hawkish Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann misses out. Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Morgan Stanley said the choice of Lagarde increases their “conviction” that the ECB will eventually resume buying bonds.Lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a “rough patch” and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response. In June 2014, she said she would “certainly hope” the ECB would conduct QE if inflation stayed sluggish — months before it announced it would do so.She also praised Draghi’s 2012 commitment to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns. In March, she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright Moliere: “The trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.”Just last September, Lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ECB, telling the Financial Times she was a ” bit annoyed and fed up” with the suggestion and that she was “not interested” in the role. Only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job, with Weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a tight race dominated by men.France has now twice secured the presidency of the two-decade-old ECB. Draghi, an Italian, was preceded by Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, who replaced Dutchman Wim Duisenberg.In common with Trichet, whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of Credit Lyonnais, Lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles. They culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi-million euro dispute linked to the same bank.Lagarde’s appointment also means the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve will be headed by former lawyers, a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as Ben Bernanke. That risks opening her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy.“She’s very political, she’s very wise, and I would assume she has the best economists that can help her with this,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment. “It is a little puzzling because she’s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there.”She does boast political nous though, which will be needed to unite fellow ECB officials when setting policy — especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy.“She has the political skills needed to build consensus on the Governing Council, is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ECB’s decisions on the larger European stage — though she may still face skepticism in Germany,” said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. “She would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space.”EU Council President Donald Tusk dismissed concerns about Lagarde’s lack of formal economic training. She will make a “perfect” ECB president, he said in Brussels.Alongside Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Lagarde will be one of two women on the six-member Executive Board. They are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25-member Governing Council, which includes the governors of euro-region national central banks and has long been dominated by men.Lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the IMF, being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016. She will now leave more than 1 1/2 years before that is due to end, likely sparking a fight between capitals over whether a European should always run the lender or if it’s time for an emerging-market candidate to do so.At the IMF, Lagarde helped negotiate the fund’s biggest ever bailout when it handed fresh aid last year to Argentina. She also sought to give emerging economies such as China more of a voice in its management, while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality. That helped broaden the fund’s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts.She sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set. As the leader of one of Greece’s major creditors, she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro-zone while at the same time persuading its European partners to allow debt relief. In 2018, she and Weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon Germany’s government to spend more and close its current account surplus.Lagarde was educated in France and the U.S., working as an intern in the U.S. Congress for a time. On graduating from the University of Paris, Nanterre, she joined the Paris office of Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. She focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions, rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999.Then-French President Jacques Chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade.

This, combined with planned U.S. sanctions against Iran, as well as the coming meeting between the American and Chinese presidents, is creating a raft of bullish factors for the precious metal.Bullion has regained its lustre after the Fed signalled it was ready for looser policy and the European Central Bank hinted at possible stimulus, which would keep real rates low, while geopolitical risks boosted demand for havens. Gold could end the year even higher, according to Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manager at the US$27 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.“Gold bulls are back in control,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., said in a note, adding the metal remains supported by rising expectations of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed’s July meeting. “The question is no longer will the Fed ease, but by how much? The Fed historically likes to kick on an easing cycle with a bang and a 50 basis point cut should become the base case.”Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Friday he called for a 50 basis point reduction in interest rates at the central bank’s June 18-19 meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York Tuesday where he’ll discuss the challenges facing the U.S. economy.Spot gold climbed as much as 0.8 per cent to US$1,411.23, and traded at US$1,404.78 at 10:25 a.m. in London. Prices soared 4.3 per cent last week, the biggest gain since April 2016. A gauge of the greenback was near a three-month low.Recent U.S. dollar weakness and more speculative money moving into bullion are among the factors that suggest gold has more upside than downside, Martin Lakos, division director at Macquarie Wealth Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. The bank forecasts US$1,450 by the first or second quarter of next year, he said.Hedge funds and other large speculators boosted their net long positions in U.S. gold futures and options to the highest since February 2018 in the period ended June 18, the day before the Fed signaled it may soon start to cut interest rates.

Only about $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) of Canadian uninsured mortgages have been pooled in RMBS deals, or about 0.1 per cent of the country’s mortgage debt, according to rating company DBRS Ltd. No lender has widely marketed such a deal since September, when private lender MCAP sold $254 million of the notes.While previous efforts to kick-start an RMBS market have borne little fruit, this time may be different as Canadian home prices are rising at the slowest pace this decade amid higher interest rates, regulatory changes and tax increases designed to reign in surging prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver.“While lenders are very well equipped to manage normal market risks, I suspect they are rather unwilling to take on the additional risk of future government intervention in the housing markets,” said Andrey Pavlov, a professor of finance at Beedie School of Business of Simon Fraser University in Greater Vancouver. “Therefore, lenders are likely more interested today than they have ever been in hedging their residential real estate exposure, and mortgage backed securities would be a good way to do so.”Lenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and returns — too much risk it turned out during the U.S. financial crisis when shady loans made it into MBS tranches. There’s been little evidence risky mortgages have become a feature in Canada. In addition, mortgages are “full recourse” in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they’ve walked away from the property.On top of raising funds, the sellers of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital they have to set aside to cover eventual losses should they meet certain conditions, including selling significant portions of the lower rated, higher risk bond tranches.The notes are repaid as borrowers pay down debt. The legal duration of the bonds could be significantly longer than the expected repayment rate suggests. This could be a useful tool for lenders to offer longer-term mortgages in a country where most of the home loans have a 5-year term. The repayment of the bonds can be adapted to the repayment of the underlying collateral.Up until 2016, Canadian lenders relied heavily on Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., the country’s national housing agency to insure mortgages with down payments of less than 20 per cent and then packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities to fund obligations. But as part of its efforts to curb taxpayer exposure to the housing market, the government made it more difficult to get insurance. The market for uninsured mortgages took off — MBS based on the debt less so.“There’s an ongoing education job around investors just to highlight the difference between that product and the CMHC product, and we are investing in that so that the market grows over time,” Bank of Montreal Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an interview last week. The RMBS “market is not nearly as developed as the CMHC mortgage bond market is. I would say our hope is over time that market will grow, and the banks generally I believe are interested in issuing that product.”The Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of participants in the bond market, has been working since at least last year to analyze the conditions and incentives that would be required to expand interest in the asset class, according to the minutes of their meetings. It conducted a focus group last month with mostly buy side institutions about the disclosure on the underlying collateral and other features they may require. The group, known as CFIF, was scheduled to discuss the issue again at a June 4 meeting.One way to bolster investors’ confidence in deals would be by setting up a public database of mortgages used in securitization deals including anonymized details of the borrower, property and loan performance, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said last month. A similar project was supported by the European Central Bank in a bid to re-start sales of asset-backed securities after investors shunned hard-to-value assets following the seizure of the U.S. mortgage securitization market in 2007.“A loan level data portal is a great idea,” said Imran Chaudhry, a senior portfolio manager at Forresters Asset Management Inc., which manages about $8.5 billion of assets and has invested in Canadian securitizations. “Issuing public RMBS deals would provide a larger investor base to the issuers and help establish a diversified funding source for them over a longer term.”The starting point of RMBS as a funding tool isn’t the most attractive for banks as investors may demand an extra yield of 20 to 30 basis points over their senior bail-in debt in a stable market situation, said Chaudhry, who is part of the CFIF. Yet, once a market develops the spreads will tighten and it will make economic sense for the lenders to issue, he said.All these efforts are occurring at a time when the household debt-to-disposable income ratio in Canada at the end of 2018 hit a record high of 175 per cent, up from 136 per cent in 2006. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income ended last year at 98 per cent, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“A key domestic risk is a sharp correction in the housing market,” officials at International Monetary Fund said in May 21 statement about the state of the Canadian economy. To be sure strong immigration, underlying strength in the economy and an unemployment rate near historic lows argues against such a scenario.Lenders’ exposure to an eventual downturn may be increasing. According to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canadian bank regulator, the ratio of uninsured over insured mortgages has jumped to the highest since 1997.At the end of March, the volume of uninsured mortgages surged 14 per cent from a year ago, accounting for about 59 per cent of the $1.17 trillion of home loans at Canada’s federally regulated banks, while insured home loans fell 7.8 per cent from a year ago, according to data from OSFI. On Tuesday, the regulator announced it was increasing a domestic stability buffer for systemically important banks to 2 per cent of their risk weighted assets from 1.75 per cent, effective Oct. 31, citing vulnerabilities that include household indebtedness.“To be clear, the system is not broken — it has served Canadians and financial institutions well,” said Poloz in a May 6 speech in Winnipeg. “We should not stop looking for improvement.”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg, Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.com"
221,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}","Stephen Gandel, Commentary",Donald Trump's trade war has already cost investors up to $7 trillion,Trump's effort to reorient the U.S.'s place in world trade could end up being much more costly than most people think,0,,0,,6/3/2019,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trumps-trade-war-has-cost-investors-up-to-7-trillion?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/trump.jpg,"If you thought President Donald Trump’s golf outings were expensive, wait until you see how much his trade war could cost investors and most likely already has.A double dose of troubling trade news late last week sent stocks sliding on Friday. That brought the drop for the month to 6.6 per cent, making it the worst May for the market since 2010 and the third worst if you go all the way back to early 1950s. And that’s saying a lot. May is, after all, according to the traders’ adage, the month where investors are supposed to go, and stay, away. In the larger picture of the market of the Trump presidency, though, May’s drop doesn’t actually look so bad. Stock prices, as measured by the broad S&P 500 market index, are still up 27 per cent, including nearly 10 per cent in the first five months of this year. In fact, the S&P 500’s decline of 1.3 per cent on Friday seemed kind of small in the wake of Trump’s demand that Mexico curb immigration or face 25 per cent tariffs and China’s threat that it could essentially ban some U.S. companies from doing any business there. That’s led some to point to the market and make the case that a trade war with China and Mexico won’t be so bad.But that conclusion is short-sighted. The correct way to gauge how much economic damage the stock market thinks a trade war could inflict is to go back not a month but to when Trump really started talking tough on tariffs, first on steel and other metals, and then on China, in late January 2018. At that time, the Russell 3000, which captures more of the stock market than the S&P 500, was trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 19.3 based on the next 12 months of earnings. At that point, analysts hadn’t fully factored into their estimates the corporate tax cut that had passed the month before. But by May, expected earnings for the Russell 3000 for 2019 had risen to nearly US$103 a share. Based on those expected earnings, and if the index had maintained its pre-trade war fears multiple, the Russell 3000 would be at 1,986, with a market cap for all the stocks in the index of US$36.2 trillion.But that’s not what happened. Instead, earnings estimates for the next 12 months have come down to US$98 a share, and the multiple has slumped to 16.6, giving the Russell — which is at 1,619 — a market capitalization of US$29.5 trillion. It is impossible to know if that nearly US$7 trillion difference can be attributed entirely to the trade war, and more than likely it cannot. Earnings estimates might have slumped anyway. Earlier this year, it looked as if interest rates were going to rise, which was also weighing on the stock market. Interest rates have instead dropped. And while the global economy has slowed, that could be trade-related as well. Bankim Chadha, the chief U.S. strategist at Deutsche Bank, put his estimate for the damage caused by the trade war at US$5 trillion.The market could also be overstating the potential damage from a trade war. The U.S. imports US$550 billion in goods from China. A 25 per cent tariff on those goods would raise prices by US$138 billion. Mexico imports total an additional US$400 billion, and a 25 per cent tariff on those goods, which is how far Trump has said he would go to curb immigration, would equal another US$90 billion, for a total of US$228 billion. That is, of course, only the cost of higher goods to consumers and for only one year. Trade wars have far-reaching effects. But still, that’s a lot less than US$5 trillion or US$7 trillion. Nonetheless, the collective wisdom of investors has a better track record at predicting the future than most economists. And even if the true number is somewhere in between, Trump’s effort to reorient the U.S.’s place in world trade could end up being much more costly than most people think.Bloomberg.com"

That would mark a fifth straight hold by the central bank since it last raised borrowing costs in October. Longer-term, most analysts predict rates won’t rise again until next year at the earliest.It’s a reflection of an economy, only just emerging from a serious slowdown, that’s still too fragile to cope with higher rates. Businesses are spooked by global trade uncertainty. Low oil prices and transportation constraints have hobbled the crucial energy sector. Record debt levels are a dead weight on consumer spending. Policy makers don’t even know for sure how past rate increases — five since mid-2017 — are affecting households.Investors, more pessimistic than analysts, are betting on cuts rather than hikes. They see an 80 per cent chance of one rate cut over the next 12 months. In the U.S., conviction on lower rates is even stronger, with at least two rate cuts priced in over that period.Still, the Bank of Canada has shown no inclination to loosen policy. For one, officials are wary of encouraging more borrowing in an economy already saddled with debt. Underlying price pressures, meanwhile, have been hovering around the 2 per cent target for more than a year. As recently as last week, Poloz continued to argue for the long-term need for higher rates.There are also federal elections. While the central bank in the past has adjusted rates in the months leading up to a general vote, policy makers would need to consider the political optics of any move — either up or down. That raises the bar for any change.The most likely reason for the Bank of Canada to be pulled off the sidelines before the October election would be an adverse global economic or financial event. This could take the form of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, a correction in global financial markets, a cut in rates by the Federal Reserve — or a combination of these.Outside of global developments, there aren’t any obvious made-in-Canada triggers for Poloz to move in the next six months.The central bank has already cut its first-half growth forecast to below what most analysts expect. That means policy makers are unlikely to be disappointed enough by the data to contemplate a cut.Recent economic numbers on employment, housing and manufacturing have actually surprised to the upside — but no one believes a better-than-expected performance in the first six months of this year will be enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to seriously consider a hike.The Bank of Canada is more optimistic about the economy in the second half and into 2020, when it expects growth to sustainably return to more normal levels of about 2 per cent. If that scenario plays out, then rate hikes are possible. If the numbers disappoint, cuts could be on the table.“The battleground is going to be the third quarter,” said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada. The “earliest that you can expect something from the bank — I think it’s also on the down rather than the up — would be” at the Oct. 30 rate decision.The full picture for that quarter however won’t appear until output data are released at the end of November. Fourth quarter data won’t be available until February 2020.The Bank of Canada has rate decisions scheduled on July 10, Sept. 4, Oct. 30 and Dec. 4.Bloomberg.com"

The Canadian yield curve is inverted, with three-month government debt yielding more than 10-year notes, suggesting fear the dispute will weigh on global growth. The rates market is pricing in 17 basis points of central bank easing through the next 12 months, according to trading of forward contracts.But the Bank of Canada has been resolute. Governor Stephen Poloz said May 17 that there’s much evidence the economy is strong, calling signs to the contrary just a “detour” and saying interest rates will rise once the headwinds dissipate. The central bank will reveal its latest policy decision Wednesday morning.The pesky trade dispute seems to be the wild card here. And it’s little wonder why: The U.S. and China are Canada’s biggest trading partners.The BoC is “caught between big global uncertainties that are negative and recent data surprises erring on the positive side,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. “There’s a tendency in the U.S. and Canada for the market to take a more dovish view of expected policy than policy makers. The curve will be another element encouraging caution.”Around the world, traders have pushed bond yields lower, as appetite for risk assets wanes and central banks around the globe cut forecasts for growth. The trade war has taken a toll on sentiment, weighing on global stocks and sapping demand for most commodities.The foreign-exchange market isn’t pricing in a dovish central-bank policy stance in Canada just yet. As of Friday, the loonie was still the best performer among currencies from Group-of-10 nations in 2019, supported by crude oil, which had gained 30 per cent this year despite recent losses. The loonie was up 1.5 per cent this year versus the U.S. dollar.Still, the outlook is cloudy. For Canada, 17 per cent of its economic growth is exposed to the fight between the U.S. and China, according to a May 24 report from Bloomberg Intelligence economists. That means the Canadian dollar is 10 per cent overvalued, they argued.Recent economic data indicating strong Canadian employment and retail sales strengthen Poloz’s optimistic position even after the central bank last month abandoned its bias toward rate hikes and dropped a reference to future increases. Citigroup Inc.’s Canada economic surprise index, which measures data surprises relative to market expectations, is at the highest level since April 2017.“That outperformance alone tilts the balance of risks towards a constructive assessment of prospects” in the next BoC policy statement, Shaun Osborne, strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a May 24 note to clients. It “provides the basis for a mildly hawkish hold decision from the policy makers.” He sees the Canadian dollar strengthening to end the year at 78.12 US cents against the greenback. It finished Friday at $74.62.Others aren’t so bullish. The loonie will weaken toward 73.96 US cents after Wednesday’s decision, strategists Andrew Kelvin and Mark McCormick at TD Securities wrote in a note May 24. They expect the yield differences between 5-year and 10-year as well as 10-year and 30-year Canadian government debt to narrow.“The balance of risk around the BoC also supports continued flattening,” they said. The narrative “remains biased towards lacklustre performance” in the currency as better Canadian data “reflects very weak expectations rather than strength in the economy.”Bloomberg.com"

The record also showed officials becoming more optimistic about the U.S. 2019 economic outlook before President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. They also had a debate about the future composition of the bond portfolio.Many participants viewed the recent easing in inflation “as likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective,” the minutes said.The Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures, excluding food and energy, slowed to a 1.6 per cent increase in the 12 months through March despite solid economic growth and a tight labour market.The FOMC at the meeting left its benchmark policy rate unchanged in a 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent target range and reiterated its pledge to be “patient” in weighing future moves. The committee next gathers on June 18-19.Fed officials received a staff presentation on two approaches to adjusting the maturity composition of the central bank’s portfolio. One approach would return the portfolio to a composition similar to outstanding Treasury securities, while another would result in a shorter-term maturity structure of three years or less.The staff analysis showed that a move to the shorter-term portfolio “would put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook,” the minutes said.In their discussion of a portfolio proportional to the Treasury market, “participants observed that moving to this target” of portfolio composition “would not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks.”Several participants judged that the proportional approach would be “well aligned with the committee’s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy.” At the same time, some of the debate focused on how much capacity each strategy would allow for adding economic stimulus through a maturity extension program.Investors have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates later this year partly on concern over inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, which prices have done for most of the last seven years.On the economic outlook, “many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated,” according to the minutes.GDP expanded at a 3.2 per cent annual pace in the first quarter,surpassing expectations, and unemployment hit a 49-year low in April. The U.S. expansion is on track to become the longest on record in July.With assistance from Jordan Yadoo.Bloomberg.com"

Quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!His venting comes as his two recent picks for the Fed, businessman Herman Cain and conservative economist Stephen Moore, have come under fire, with several Republicans indicating Cain may not be able to win confirmation in the Senate.It also comes days after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a frequent target of Trump’s criticism, told lawmakers at a Democratic Party retreat that the central bank won’t bend to political pressure, according to two people in the room for the closed-door event.Trump picked Powell as Fed chairman, replacing Janet Yellen, but later indicated that he regretted the decision, and in late 2018 discussed the feasibility of firing him before appearing to decide against it. Trump has criticized the Fed’s rate increases as it tried to gradually move them to a level that neither stymies nor stimulates growth.The rate hikes have slowed some segments of the economy, such as housing, but overall the U.S. economic expansion continues, along with the lowest unemployment in decades and inflation near the Fed’s 2 per cent target.Lately, Trump has urged the Fed to cut rates to turn the economy into a “rocket ship,” which White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week would be growth in the 4 to 4.5 per cent range.The Federal Reserve raised rates four times in 2018, but has since paused, saying it will be “patient” as it assesses the need for any additional changes in the policy rate, now in a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.U.S. stocks have risen sharply this year after the Fed’s dovish pivot, reversing a late-2018 swoon. The benchmark S&P 500 Index closed Friday at 2,907.41, less than one percent below its record high close from September. U.S. central bankers in March signalled no rate moves in 2019, based on their outlook for solid if unspectacular economic growth with inflation near goal.If Trump was referring to the more narrow Dow Jones Industrial Average, his tweet suggested the index could be over 36,000 points absent the Fed’s moves. The Dow closed on Friday at 26,412.30.Prior to Trump’s tweeting, global policy makers had spent the weekend leaping to the defence of the Fed and other central banks facing pressure from politicians. At talks of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Saturday that he was “certainly worried about central bank independence” and especially “in the most important jurisdiction in the world.”While many politicians want their central banks to juice growth by keeping monetary policy easy, the risk is the political meddling leaves investors worrying about a flare up of inflation and push up market interest rates in response, potentially hurting expansions.Bloomberg.com"

The 2019 growth rate would be the weakest since 2009, when the world economy shrank. It’s the third time the IMF has downgraded its outlook in six months.The global volume of trade in goods and services will increase 3.4 per cent this year, weaker than the 3.8 per cent gain in 2018 but reduced from the IMF’s January estimate of 4 per cent, the fund’s report showed.Global economic growth will recover in the second half of this year, before plateauing at 3.6 per cent from next year, according to the Washington-based fund. A series of encouraging developments have boosted optimism about the world economy in recent weeks, including the decision of the Federal Reserve to put interest-rate hikes on hold and encouraging data from China’s manufacturing sector and the U.S. job market.Still, the IMF is warning that risks are skewed to the downside, with a range of threats menacing the global economy, including the possible collapse of negotiations between the U.S. and China to end their trade war, and the departure of Britain from the European Union without a transition agreement, known as the “no-deal” Brexit scenario.“Amid waning global growth momentum and limited policy space to combat downturns, avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity needs to be the main priority,” the IMF said.IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is warning that the world economy faces a “delicate moment” as finance ministers and central bankers prepare to gather in the U.S. capital this week for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.While intense trade talks between the U.S. and China have raised expectations of a lasting truce between the world’s two-largest economies, analysts remain worried about the strength of the global economy, a decade after the financial crisis. Lagarde said last week the fund doesn’t anticipate a recession in the near-term.The fund cut its forecast for U.S. growth to 2.3 per cent this year, down 0.2 percentage point since the IMF’s last global outlook in January. The downgrade reflects the impact of the partial government shutdown that ended in January, as well as lower-than-expected public spending. The fund upgraded its U.S. forecast next year to 1.9 per cent, up 0.1 percentage point, on the Fed’s shift to a more patient stance on interest rates.The IMF slashed its outlook for the euro area to 1.3 per cent this year, down 0.3 point from three months ago. Growth is expected to be softer in several major European economies, including Germany, where weak global demand and tougher car-emission standards have hit factory production. Weak domestic demand and high sovereign-debt spreads have dimmed Italy’s outlook, while street protests in France weighed on growth, the fund said.The IMF cut its outlook for U.K. growth to 1.2 per cent this year, down 0.3 points from three months ago.The IMF raised its forecast for Chinese growth by 0.1 point to 6.3 per cent this year, while lowering its projection for growth in Japan by 0.1 point to 1 per cent. The fund cut its outlook for India’s growth this year to 7.3 per cent, down from 7.5 per cent in January.Bloomberg.com"

He cited recent data — the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January — to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.“There are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,” he said. “Recent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.”Poloz’s comments are the first since a segment of Canada’s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada’s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need — at least over time — for rates to move higher. He didn’t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada’s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term — unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada’s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.In his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy’s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to “positive growth” later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will “eventually be completed.” Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials “they need to make new investments,” aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.“We only have to look back a few years for an example,” said Poloz, “following the oil price collapse of 2015.”He also cited “numerous advantages” beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth — including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a “portfolio” of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials — after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector — can “see many areas of encouraging economic growth” in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.“These data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,” Poloz said. “Judging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.”Bloomberg.com"

The gains were broad-based outside of the energy sector, and included the biggest one-month increase in construction activity in more than five years. Manufacturing output also surged.The numbers paint a much less bleak picture for an economy that came to a near halt at the end of last year, with January GDP now putting growth on pace for a stronger first quarter than most economists are anticipating. The gains should also bolster confidence among officials at the Bank of Canada that growth will bounce back.“Overall, a better than expected start to Q1 after a near zero growth rate in Q4, and reason enough for the Bank of Canada to hang on to its hopes that the growth stall late last year will prove temporary,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.Financial markets are betting the central bank is likely to cut interest rates because of the weak run of data until now. Canada’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter, including contractions of 0.1 per cent in each of the final two months of 2018. Economists had been forecasting equally sluggish growth this quarter.The Canadian dollar jumped on the report, gaining 0.6 per cent to 74.87 US cents at 8:39 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on Canadian two-year bonds rose 5 basis points to 1.54 per cent.The gains would have even been larger had the Alberta government not imposed mandatory oil production cuts in January to ease pipeline bottlenecks that have depressed prices for heavy Canadian crude. Oilsands extraction was down 4.1 per cent in January.Statistics Canada saw 18 of 20 industrial sectors posting increases in January.

Back then, the country was revving up from the financial crisis and oil was over US$100 a barrel.Now, the nation may already be in recession after growing at an annualized pace of just 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter and a pretty “soggy” start to the year, said Wolf, part of the asset allocation team at Fidelity Investments Canada, which manages about $136 billion. He stressed his views were his own, not the firm’s.“There’s a good chance that those stars are going to be misaligned,” Wolf said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office.The big problem for Canada is that a household deleveraging appears to be starting just as the global economy is slowing, said Wolf, who was an adviser at the Bank of Canada before joining Fidelity in 2014. Home values fell nationwide last year for the first time since at least 1990, while household debt burdens touched a record high. Meanwhile, Canada’s competitiveness problems remain, he said.“It may not meet that technical definition, but it could very well feel like a recession for a big part of the economy,” said David Tulk, an institutional portfolio manager who works with Wolf. History has shown that it takes a “long, long” time to restore household balance sheets, a situation that will be all that more difficult with trade and business spending hampered, he said.Wolf and Tulk said it’s hard to say how long or deep Canada’s slowdown will be.“You’ve never had debt levels as high, relative to incomes in Canada,” said Tulk. Even if the Bank of Canada has stopped raising rates, “there’s still kind of a big bulge in the python, so to speak, in terms of prior increases in interest rates and prior actions.”While Canada’s job market has been on fire, posting its best start to the year since 1981, Tulk points out said the gauge is a lagging indicator; hours worked have receded. Business investment in the final three months of 2018 meanwhile, fell 5.9 per cent from the first quarter of last year, and 22 per cent below record high levels in 2014.Wolf has been bearish on the loonie in the past. Lately, he’s getting some company. Toronto-Dominion Bank downgraded its forecast on Friday, seeing at within a range of 74 U.S. cents to 71 U.S. cents for much of this year. Citigroup technical strategists are targeting 73.52 US cents to 72.99. The median of analyst forecasts’ compiled by Bloomberg puts the loonie at 77.52 U.S. cents in the fourth quarter of the year.One option to shield investors from potential shakeout of Canadian assets is to replace some of them with emerging markets, which are cheaper and have better long term growth prospects, said Wolf.With assistance from Theophilos ArgitisBloomberg.com"
249,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Erik Schatzker,Bill Gross says this secret condition made him a successful investor — and infamously short-tempered,"Even after one of the most storied careers in financial markets, Bill Gross has a few surprises left",0,,0,,3/1/2019,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/taxes-deficits-and-aspergers-the-bill-gross-you-didnt-know,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/bill-gross.jpg,"Even after one of the most storied careers in financial markets, Bill Gross has a few surprises left.For one, he’s been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, the autism-spectrum disorder. Gross says he lived most of his life unaware of the condition and now believes it helps explain not only why he was such a successful investor for so long but also why he could, by his own admission, rub people the wrong way.Gross, long one of the most vocal critics of post-crisis stimulus, now sounds like a near-convert to modern monetary theory. He says deflation poses a huge challenge for central banks, admires what Japan has done to revive its moribund economy and thinks the U.S. government should consider doubling the size of its deficit.And the billionaire and registered Republican agrees with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that the rich should pay more in taxes — if not quite the 70 per cent she’s proposing at the margin. It’s a “necessary evil” to correct the failings of American capitalism, Gross says, adding that if inequality persists there’ll be a “revolution at the ballot box.”He even muses on who might inherit his onetime title of king of the bond market.Gross, 74, shared the revelations in a 90-minute interview with Bloomberg Television at his office in Newport Beach, California. He touched on everything from recession risks to a recent round of golf with discount-brokerage pioneer Chuck Schwab as he counted down the hours to his official retirement. Friday will be his last as a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson Group Plc, the firm he joined in 2014.It’s been 48 years since William Hunt Gross, an Ohio native, Duke University graduate, Navy veteran and blackjack whiz, started as an investment analyst at Pacific Mutual Life. He went on to co-found Pacific Investment Management Co. in 1974 and played the starring role as Pimco grew to become one of the world’s largest asset managers, overseeing more than US$2 trillion at its peak. His Pimco Total Return Fund so reliably beat its bond-market rivals that he was dubbed “the bond king.”More recently, Gross has had less to celebrate. After feuding with his Pimco partners over strategy, succession and managerial control, Gross was ousted in 2014. His second act at Janus was a headline-making dud as poor returns spurred withdrawals. His three-decade marriage fell apart in a split so acrimonious it became fodder for tabloids thousands of miles away.That’s a lot for anyone to take, let alone a portfolio manager responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in client money. Yet Gross says he was able to maintain focus and doesn’t blame his personal ordeals for poor investment decisions.“I’m an Asperger, and Aspergers can compartmentalize,” he said, revealing his diagnosis publicly for the first time. “They can operate in different universes without the other universes affecting them as much. Yeah, I had a nasty divorce, and I still had, you know, feelings about Pimco. But I think I did pretty well in compartmentalizing them. Not that I didn’t wake up in the middle of the night and start damning one side or the other. But when I came to work it was all business.”The reason he failed to deliver better returns at Janus is much simpler: “I made some bad trades.”Gross learned he has Asperger’s only after reading Michael Lewis’s “The Big Short.” In one passage, Lewis recounts the unusual characteristics of one of the book’s heroes, Michael Burry, a doctor-turned-investor who also was diagnosed with the condition as an adult. Gross recognized that he shared many of the same qualities and had similarly obsessive habits. He went to a psychiatrist, who confirmed the condition.“It’s allowed me to stay at 30,000 feet as opposed to being on the ground,” Gross said, discussing why he thinks Asperger’s probably made him a better investor, if also infamously short-tempered. “That’s not necessarily good in terms of one-to-one. People think you’re angry or an a-hole or whatever. But it helps you to focus on the longer-term things without getting mixed up in the details.”That’s the Bill Gross his former colleagues at Pimco will recognize. For years, they found him aloof, volatile and seemingly lacking in empathy. Symptoms of the disorder range widely, according to the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and can include degrees of difficulty with social interactions and communication, as well as deeply focused thinking and a preference for consistency and order.Gross kept his diagnosis a secret, sharing it with close friends, and dropping only one hint publicly. In a February 2016 blog post on investing, Gross speculated as to why he wasn’t included as a character in Lewis’s best-seller: “Perhaps I wasn’t addled enough like co-star hedge fund manager Michael Burry, who I share affection for and an affliction (and it’s not a glass eye).”While Gross says he’s “sort of proud” of his condition because “it explains a lot about me,” he no longer believes it’s as much of an advantage professionally.“The markets are substantially different today than they were when I started, more day-to-day, more robotic, more machine-dominated,” he said. “So it’s not a negative, but it’s probably not as much of a positive.”As a bond-market investor, Gross had to have views on monetary and fiscal policy, and he shared them publicly in the investment outlooks he posted regularly on Pimco’s website and, later, on Janus’s. One consistent thread was a critique of budget deficits, zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing. He wrongly predicted they’d spark runaway inflation and hurt returns on stocks and bonds.Now, Gross appears to be revisiting those views. Although he still believes low-rate policies destroy the risk-reward relationship in a market economy, he recognizes that the government and the Federal Reserve can work together to combat deflationary forces like America’s aging population and Amazon.com.“Why can’t the government have a US$2-trillion deficit if the Fed is simply going to buy it, like they do in Japan?” Gross said. “Well, Jim Grant would say, ‘Mmm, it would be inflationary.’ But it hasn’t been. So, yeah, I would say Trump or the next president, whoever he or she is, could go to US$2 trillion, as long as the Fed was willing to accommodate.”This clearly isn’t the Bill Gross of 2012, who declared the “cult of equity” dead and predicted an “age of inflation.” He describes his politics as increasingly liberal, and he jokes that he re-registered as a Republican just to pass muster at his country club.Gross believes tax rates on high earners need to be raised to restore balance in American capitalism and fund benefits for the middle class, such as access to affordable health care. That’s why he’s sympathetic to Ocasio-Cortez, the congressional freshman who has energized the left wing of the Democratic Party, even if he doesn’t agree with all her ideas.“Maybe the next time, the next election, there will be a ‘socialist’ in the White House,” he said. “The wealthy have been advantaged for a long time and certainly the past few years with the tax cuts. The middle class hasn’t necessarily suffered, but the gap has increased.”The question is how heavy the tax burden should be. Other billionaires, such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC’s Howard Marks, have warned against the consequences of “confiscatory taxes.” Gross says a top marginal rate of 70 per cent — the number floated by Ocasio-Cortez — would be too high.“I just think Trump took it too far,” he said.Gross himself has a fortune the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates at US$1.4 billion. He plans to manage that money and the US$500 million in his foundation as a one-man family office. Gross said he’ll do so “conservatively,” investing in closed-end funds and municipal bonds and continuing with one of his favourite trades, selling options on market volatility.His routine, if all goes according to plan, will have him starting at 6:30 or 7 a.m., keeping at it for two or three hours, and then playing a round of golf.Gross said he wants to be remembered for investing clients’ savings profitably and helping to build a “wealth-creating machine” at Pimco. That leaves only one question: Will there be another bond market king?Probably not, according to Gross. One reason is the proliferation of passive investment vehicles. Anyone who claims to be a king of index funds is “just a puppet because the market is making the decisions.” Gross volunteered that he wouldn’t pick Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive officer and co-founder of DoubleLine Capital who’s frequently cited as the new king. If anyone, he said it might be Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, in part because of his “great long-term perspective.”“In the right environment, 20 years ago, he could have been a bond king,” Gross said. “But I don’t think he’s got the market or maybe the willingness to be a king. Who would? Well, I guess I did. In retrospect it carries a certain burden. The crown is heavy.”Bloomberg.com"

The share of those who reported negative or somewhat negative effects was 41 per cent, unchanged from the previous survey.The results may come as a surprise to Governor Stephen Poloz, who paused rate hikes in January, saying previous increases — there have been five since mid-2017 — may be having a stronger impact than first expected. In an interview last month, Poloz said he’s keeping a close eye on developments in the nation’s housing market, which has slowed partly due to higher borrowing costs.Almost half, or 46 per cent, of respondents report no impact from higher interest rates, down from 50 per cent in October. The share of Canadians seeing benefits — typically people holding interest earning assets — was 8.4 per cent, versus 7.5 per cent three months earlier.Some economists have warned the previous rate hikes may already have gone too far, and there’s concern about the impact on the economy if Canada’s highly indebted households pare back spending to pay debt instead. The country’s debt service ratio — the share of disposable income required to pay principal and interest on outstanding loans — rose to 14.5 per cent in the third quarter, the highest since before the 2008 financial crisis, according to Statistics Canada.But judging from the latest Nanos survey, things aren’t getting much worse. The net score — the difference between those reporting negative versus positive impacts — was 32.9 per cent, virtually unchanged from the October reading of 33.2 per cent.The poll shows young Canadians are the most likely to be hurt by higher interest rates. Some 51 per cent of 18- to 34-year-old respondents said higher borrowing costs were curtailing spending. That compares to 42 per cent for those 35 to 54 years of age, and 34 per cent for the 55-plus set. In addition, 43 per cent of women reported a negative impact, versus 39 per cent of men, the survey showed.Nanos conducted the polling on behalf of Bloomberg between Feb. 2 and Feb. 5. The following are the results from the hybrid telephone and online survey of 1,000 Canadians.Bloomberg.com"

U.S. chief financial officers in a Duke University survey published in December overwhelmingly said they expect a recession within two years.“I wouldn’t be as definitive, but it seems pretty likely,” Krugman said.While Krugman doesn’t expect a crisis of the magnitude of 2008, he said policy makers in Washington would struggle to contain large shocks. The economist, a vocal critic of the Trump administration, said it was hard to see the U.S. leadership “respond in any kind of a nimble way.”“We’re clearly in worse shape,” he said, citing lower public debt in 2008 and “lots of room” to lower interest rates back then. “And we came into the last crisis with pretty remarkable leadership.”“Let’s put it this way, our current Treasury Secretary is no Hank Paulson,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The “market has started to normalize after unprecedented activity in recent years.”Toronto’s housing market is dramatically cooling after higher interest rates and new mortgage regulations bite. The city joins other global metropolises such as London and Sydney seeing a slowdown as international investors retreat and domestic buyers balk at higher prices.Sales of new homes fell to 25,161 from 2017, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association, which used data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s the lowest annual number since Toronto-based Altus started tracking the figures in 2000.Single-family homes showed the biggest decline, plunging 50 per cent to 3,831 from 2017 and 74 per cent below the 10-year average. Condos sales fell 38 per cent to 21,330, but only 4 per cent below the 10-year average.While the benchmark price of a new single-family home slumped 6.7 per cent to $1,143,505 in December on the year, condo prices surged 11 per cent to $796,815, according to BILD’s report.But figures from Urbanation show further weakness building in condos as well. A record 21,991 units are expected to be completed this year, up 29 per cent from 2017. While 98 per cent of those units are pre-sold, more than half were bought by investors who will either rent their units or sell them, the firm said.The number of unsold units in development jumped 47 per cent in the fourth quarter from the year before to more than a two-year high and price gains for units under development grew only 0.4 per cent between the third and fourth quarters, the smallest quarterly increase in almost three years.“The slowdown in activity last year can partly be attributed to less demand from investors, who typically represent the largest component of new condominium purchasers,” in the Toronto region, according to Urbanation’s report.“The market is out of balance,” said David Wilkes, president and chief executive officer of BILD, an industry group for about 1,500 companies in the Toronto region. “We join other industry groups in calling on the federal government to revisit the stress test and allow a longer amortization period for first-time buyers. And we look forward to working with our municipal partners on removing barriers to development such as excessive red tape and outdated bylaws.”Bloomberg.com"

She wants Toronto-Dominion to be No. 1 in all areas of banking, and she maintains the company’s No. 4 position for these hybrid home loans pitched as mortgage substitutes doesn’t cut it.“Our goal is to be the undisputed leader in all categories of Canadian banking,” Currie said in an interview last week at the Toronto headquarters. “We are below our embedded growth opportunity in that product in particular, so I continue to feel comfortable that on a relative basis we’ll have pretty good growth.”Canada’s economy is cooling after years of growth fuelled by real estate investment and consumer borrowing, and as higher interest rates and regulations bite into the housing market. Such a backdrop, along with near-record household debt levels, is making policymakers skittish about borrowing burdens.The government’s Financial Consumer Agency of Canada targeted home-equity credit lines in a report this month, noting that about a quarter of Canadians with such debt are paying only interest. Over the past 15 years, HELOCs have been the largest contributor to household debt outside of mortgages.That has investor David Baskin worried about government stepping in with more rules, bringing uncertainty to banks that have profited from this lending.“HELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealots,” said Baskin, whose firm Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion. “I personally don’t think they are a huge issue in Canada as long as rates are low and the loan-to-value ratios are reasonable, which they usually are.”Toronto-Dominion has two types of HELOCs, and while the bank has seen little growth in its non-amortizing product, another offering introduced four years ago as a HELOC-mortgage hybrid has seen rapid growth. Those loans jumped 33 per cent last fiscal year to $44.1 billion, surpassing the overall size of the older product.HELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealotsThe bank has been playing catchup to others that have long offered such hybrid loans, and Currie’s effort is more designed to recapture lost business from customers who turned to rivals for those loans instead of an aggressive push for new clients. In the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, 90 per cent of new HELOCs went to existing customers.The growth helped Toronto-Dominion post 10 straight months of market-share growth and post record profit in its Canadian retail business, a 10 per cent jump unmatched by domestic competitors.“That outperformance really helped us in 2018,” she said.Toronto-Dominion is likely to increase its home-loans portfolio by “mid single digits” in 2019, after last year’s six per cent growth rate, according to Currie.Currie said she’s comfortable with the risks to the bank and its customers, noting that a “large majority” of its borrowers make principal repayments regularly in those amortizing loans.Other priorities include gaining more business from business credit cards and mutual funds. Toronto-Dominion has added training for investment advisers in its branches to help them improve customer conversations — and the bank’s No. 2 standing in funds.The overall strategy under Currie, who has headed Canadian banking for three years, hasn’t deviated much as the bank continues to push extended branch hours and convenience. Still, the bar to poach customers remains high.“They’re basically as good as the rest,” Baskin said, adding that taking market share is tough. “It’s very difficult because of the size of the Canadian market for any of the banks to gain a huge advantage over the other banks in Canada: it’s entrenched customers, the market is pretty split up and there’s a lot of inertia.”Bloomberg.com"

Toronto also saw sales fall sharply, but by half as much as Vancouver and with prices in Canada’s biggest city little changed in recent months.“I’m not worried about Toronto, I’m worried more about Vancouver at this stage,” said Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal. “The biggest worry I have for Vancouver really is the expectations that could turn a lot more downbeat because of the downward trend we are seeing now.”I'm not worried about Toronto, I'm worried more about Vancouver at this stageThe relative performance reflects in part a bigger surge in prices during the boom in Vancouver, where they gained 68 per cent over the last five years. That’s ahead of Toronto’s 58 per cent increase.“Vancouver is in full-blown correction mode,” Royal Bank of Canada economist Robert Hogue said in a research note Tuesday. “Prices are poised to depreciate more — potentially a lot more considering the degree to which they are still unaffordable to average buyers.”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

The U.S. auto giant announced in November that it intends to cease production at its iconic plant east of Toronto at the end of this year. Auto workers, who were shocked by the news, protested GM’s plan by staging sit-ins this week, and industry analysts have warned that other factories could follow.[related_llinks /]“Being from Oshawa, I regret that very much,” Poloz said at press conference in Ottawa after holding interest rates steady for a second straight time. “When I was young in Oshawa, there were 10 times as many people working there — 75 per cent of my high school class went to work in General Motors. It was a really important part of the town.”Auto manufacturing has since declined in the city and will eventually go to zero, the central banker said. “And yet Oshawa has grown and people live there and they all have jobs. So, this is what happens in economies, and that’s the thing you have to admire — that Schumpeter’s creative destruction thing is true.”Much of the Canadian economy is growing at capacity and struggling to find workers, Poloz said, despite the high-profile struggles of sectors like automotive manufacturing. Governments will offer retraining to affected workers, he said.“The economy will always have the stresses of some form of some things declining,” he said. “In the end, I’m confident that we’re going to be okay through all this, and that the key for folks, for example, in Oshawa is to focus on: How do we adjust?”While GM is shutting its Oshawa plant, it’s not leaving Canada entirely. The company announced in 2016 that it would hire more engineers in the country as part of a push into self-driving cars.Retraining, and finding new jobs for workers, “makes me feel optimistic that we’re going to manage these adjustments reasonably well.”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

Yes, but not what we’ve seen in the past three years.”Ritchie joined representatives from Menkes Developments Ltd., CentreCourt Inc. and Diamond Kilmer Developments for a round table discussion at Bloomberg’s Toronto offices on the outlook for the city’s condo market last week. Together, the closely held companies have built more than 100,000 condo units, including Menkes’ Harbour Plaza and Tridel’s Ten York by the waterfront.Toronto condo prices have surged 50 per cent in the past three years to a record high of $570,764 (US$425,000) in September, according to research firm Urbanation Inc. The segment soared amid the housing frenzy in the first half of 2017. While price gains have eased since then, they remain buoyant compared with the single-home segment which has been hit by harsher mortgage lending rules and rising interest rates.“We have hit the peak and I think prices will probably stay flat, for, I would even say the next two years,” said Jane Renwick, vice president of marketing and sales at Diamond Kilmer Developments, a joint venture between Diamond Corp. and Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund. The group is developing its first project of about 250,000 square feet of housing in mid-rise condos and townhouses that will include a mix of market and affordable units.Shamez Virani, president at CentreCourt, added: “There is, for the first time in a little while, at least in the last 24 months, signs of resistance, signs of certain projects not being able to break barriers on pricing.”Additional condo cancellations are also likely due to rising construction costs that could offset revenue from presales and pressure margins, the developers said. Costs have increased across the board, including steel, due to tariffs, labour, municipal charges and land.This year, 15 buildings with more than 4,500 units have been cancelled, Urbanation said. That compares with 1,678 for 2017 and 379 for 2016.I promise you, pricing is going up“We’ve seen cost inflation in the construction space being in the range of 10 per cent this past year, which is something we hadn’t seen previously,” Virani said. “The theme of 2019 is about protecting your market, about ensuring that you’re really being thoughtful about the timing and the allocation of costs, and selling and building in the same market environment so you don’t get caught in that situation where you’re forced to cancel a project.”While the developers may be cautious short-term, all are confident that prices will continue to rise longer term due to supply constraints and Toronto’s growth prospects. Gross domestic product in the city of 2.8 million people has been running at about 3.4 per cent for the past three years, above its population growth of 1.6 per cent, according to a city report.Jared Menkes, executive vice president of high-rise residential at Menkes Developments was unwavering for the future. “There’s a lot of red tape that’s slowing down bringing more product to market,” Menkes said. “I promise you, pricing is going up.”Below are additional insights on what to expect in 2019:Jared Menkes on condo sales outlook in 2019:“I think 2019, you’re going be putting in more work just like for 2018 — it’s not like it was 2016 or 2017, where you just opened the door and there’s a line up around the block. It’s rolling up your sleeves, telling the story, explaining the value proposition, the reasons to buying into this location.”Shamez Virani on shift to suburbs:“The big part of the solution is the 905. Municipalities like Vaughn, Mississauga, Markham and Richmond Hill are all municipalities that have realized that because of price appreciation, all of a sudden, there is development potential on a lot of their land. They’re realizing that the City of Toronto is slowly closing the taps to new development and they’re going to be the beneficiaries of it, so there’s been this really meaningful shift in the last two years for developers to really go into the 905.”Jim Ritchie on condo price growth opportunities:“There are opportunities in 2019 where there could be reasonably good price increases depending on the product and where it is. There are some parts in our city that have a lot more competition and are building very similar product lines, maybe in that particular circumstance, we’re not going to see as much inflation, but you really have to break it out and look at it.”Jane Renwick on affordable housing:“Before, development didn’t happen east of Yonge because of Regent Park and Moss Park and where we had these areas where we had a concentration of social housing as opposed to it being integrated among market housing. So I think the best way to go is to integrate it.”Bloomberg.com"

Take the Victory!The Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-meeting in Washington on Tuesday, and trading in federal funds futures indicate a greater than 70 percent chance of the panel’s fourth rate hike this year.Trump’s tweets about monetary policy have intensified as U.S. stocks tumble amid signs the world’s largest economy may be moderating. Fresh evidence of that came out just minutes after his latest salvo. The New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index tumbled this month to a 19-month low.For months, Trump has accused the central bank of undermining the economy’s growth by hiking interest rates. U.S. presidents have typically refrained from encroaching on the independence of the Fed.“The criticism by the administration of the Fed is not going to stop, and it’s likely to intensify,” said Joshua Feinman, global chief economist at DWS in New York and a former Fed staff economist. “The president stakes so much of his claim to achievement on the stock market and economic performance. He’s worried about whether that will falter, so he’s setting up the Fed to take the blame.”After the Fed’s Dec. 18-19 meeting, expectations of further hikes shrink, with investors betting on only one more move. The consensus among economists is for two 2019 hikes. That is partly due to Fed officials signaling in recent speeches that their tightening campaign has succeeded in raising borrowing costs near to territory that they consider neutral in terms of speeding up or slowing the economy.Fed officials have also noted they are paying attention to risks such as slowing growth in Europe and in interest-sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy. Financial conditions have also tightened, partly because of stock-market losses on the White House’s harsh rhetoric on trade and fears that uncertainty over Trump’s policies could hit long-run investment spending.Bloomberg.com"

Adding to the risk aversion was news that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s push to avoid a so-called “hard Brexit” may be at risk.“Today’s move feels like the market is a scorned lover. It had believed, for whatever reason, that progress was being made at the G-20 and that turns out to be murky — it feels lied to,” said Michael Antonelli, a managing director at Robert W.

But “we haven’t resolved anything yet.”In the Treasury market, all eyes remain on the yield curve after three-year yields climbed above those of their five-year peers on Monday, potentially foreshadowing the end of the Fed’s tightening campaign. The more closely watched part of the curve — the gap between two-year and 10-year yields — remains upwardly sloped.Traders are even starting to bet that the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as 2020. The swaps market has moved up the timing for when it sees the hiking cycle peaking, toward the end of 2019 or early 2020, a period when the Fed’s own projections indicate tightening will still be under way. Swaps indicate about 5 basis points of a cut priced in by mid-2020.Traders are even starting to bet that the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as 2020“Any breakthroughs on trade also brings the Fed back into the picture,” Dan Skelly, Morgan Stanley equity model portfolio solutions head, said on Bloomberg TV. “If you look at the market the last week or so you saw the market pop on both the dovish Fed — or a perceived dovish Fed, if you will — as well as the trade headlines.

288,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Josh Wingrove,This week’s fiscal update will have Trudeau seeking redemption from a frustrated business community,The update will likely include incentives for capital investment but not an across-the-board reduction in corporate taxes,0,Canada fiscal stimuls not including rate cut,-1,,11/19/2018,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-seeks-redemption-from-business-leaders-in-budget-update?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/morneau-trudeau.jpg,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gets one of his last chances this week to mend frosty ties with Canada’s business community as next year’s election nears.Trudeau’s finance chief, Bill Morneau, will unveil a fiscal update Wednesday in Ottawa that provides a shot at redemption after warnings about the country’s fading competitiveness. It will likely include incentives for capital investment but not an across-the-board reduction in corporate taxes.The government has frustrated some business leaders with an agenda heavily focused on social issues and riled economists by running unnecessary deficits. Morneau’s last federal budget — which punted infrastructure investments in favour of new program spending — landed in February without a mention of U.S. tax reform despite calls to keep pace.“What people will be looking for is a clear statement from the government that they understand how serious the challenges are that businesses face today,” Perrin Beatty, head of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview last week. “And that there’s a sense of urgency in addressing those issues.”In addition to U.S. tax cuts, business leaders have warned a rising regulatory burden and other changes, such as minimum wage hikes and a carbon tax, are making the country less attractive to investment at a time when it needs new drivers of growth. Most economists believe the nation’s highly indebted households are about to tap out and slip into a long-term slump as interest rates rise, with consumer spending projected to slow down to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession.One thing that’s certain to appear in the fiscal update is red ink, according to Craig Wright, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. “Ottawa long ago abandoned any pretense of balancing the budget,” he wrote in a Nov. 13 research note. “Ongoing fiscal stimulus is putting added strain on capacity as well as upward pressure on interest rates.”Morneau has already dropped hints about what the document will include. It will respond to the need to “make investments on a competitive basis,” the finance minister told reporters last week, a likely reference to being able to more quickly write off business capital expenses. However, Morneau said he would do so “in a prudent way,” signalling he won’t usher in across-the-board, immediate write-offs. He also hinted at regulatory reform, particular in the energy sector.“We are going to look towards making sure that businesses can feel their opportunity to create investments and create jobs is positive in Canada while always ensuring that we address the importance of long-term, fiscally sustainable approaches,” Morneau said on a conference call last Monday from Beijing, where he and Trade Minister Jim Carr were holding sector-by-sector talks with their Chinese counterparts.Business leaders have been essentially biting their tongues over the last year as Trudeau’s team dealt with U.S. trade talks. But now businesses are growing frustrated by what many say is a government that doesn’t regularly talk about economic issues. Frustration is particularly high in western Canada, where pipeline capacity and a supply glut have brought prices for heavy Alberta crude to record lows. President Donald Trump’s tax cuts are only amplifying calls for action.It would be unfortunate if they want to crawl their way to the right place, because that doesn't align with how businesses make decisions“What we’re hoping for is action that responds to what has taken place,” said Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, which represent the chief executives of top firms. The council wants government to streamline regulations and review personal income tax brackets that make it tough to recruit top talent. It has also called for a temporary, 100 per cent write-off on capital investment like machinery and equipment purchases. Mostly, though, Hyder said Trudeau and Morneau need to act quickly.“It would be unfortunate if they want to crawl their way to the right place, because that doesn’t align with how businesses make decisions,” Hyder said in a phone interview last week.After the fiscal update, Morneau’s last big publication before the 2019 election will be next year’s budget — which will be a de facto platform complete with new spending pledges ahead of the vote in October. That essentially makes this week’s document his last significant chance to respond to business concerns.Dennis Darby, president of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters industry group, said its members want Canada to match U.S. capital cost allowances in scope to “level the playing field” with their American competitors. “We’re very hopeful that Minister Morneau has been listening,” he said by phone.The group also favours comprehensive tax reform and wants government to find a resolution to the tariff fight with the U.S. on steel and aluminum. Though his group is broadly supportive of the government’s social agenda, Darby acknowledged there’s growing impatience among some for the government to talk about their issues too.“When are we going to focus on the economy?” he said. “This is your chance to say, yeah, we understand and we’re going to redouble our efforts.”Bloomberg.com"

Together with other measures, that could save $2 billion this year, according to report from Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Allowing other programs to lapse could save another $1 billion while freezing a minimum wage hike may support employment and boost revenues, the bank said.But the Progressive Conservative government, which swept to power in June, also made some costly campaign pledges which could push the budget shortfall to as high as $18.7 billion in 2019-20, according to TD. Those promises included a cut to corporate and personal income taxes and reduction in the gas tax.“How this is going to line up with the campaign promise to balance is going to be interesting,” said Joey Mack, Toronto-based director of fixed income at GMP Securities LP. “But given all the announcements pointing to huge deficits, I don’t think we will get too much reaction” if the deficit stays below $18 billion, he said.Ontario is expected to grow at about 2 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent next year according economists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Ontario bonds have declined 1.5 per cent this year, trailing the 1.3 per cent drop for Quebec and 1.1 per cent for the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch bond index of provincial borrowers. Investors in Ontario’s 2.9 per cent bonds due 20128 demand about 67 basis points over similar duration federal Canada debt, according to bid prices in Bloomberg.While risk premiums aren’t a source of big concern, the absolute yields are rising as the Bank of Canada and other central banks around the world increase interest rates to cool inflationary pressures. Since the end of June, when Ford took office, the yield investors demand to hold province’s debt maturing between three months and five years have increased between 40 and 50 basis points, Bloomberg data show.“An interest rate increase of 25 basis points will cost Ontario taxpayers an additional $100 million a year in interest payments,” Fedeli wrote in a Nov. 1 opinion column for the Toronto Sun. “For the government of Ontario, interest rate increases pose a significant challenge.”Bloomberg.com"
