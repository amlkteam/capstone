The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk listed two of his California homes for sale Sunday, days after announcing that he would get rid of most of his possessions.He’s seeking a combined US$39.5 million for the Bel Air properties, including one that was previously owned by the late Gene Wilder, according to the listings on Zillow. Both are for sale by owner.Musk, 48, posted more than a dozen tweets in less than 75 minutes on Friday, including one in which he said he’s selling “almost all” of his physical possessions. In another, he said he believed Tesla’s stock price was too high, prompting a 10 per cent plunge on the day.As for high-end Los Angeles real estate, it’s not exactly a seller’s market at the moment. Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings. Fewer buyers were coming from China, Russia and the Middle East amid international tensions, and limits on state and local tax deductions dampened the appeal of owning California homes for wealthy U.S. buyers.With demand slowing, more and more would-be sellers are taking their homes off the market, said Beverly Hills real estate agent Jade Mills. But shrinking inventory means some homes will still find buyers.“People are still having to move and relocate, even within California,” she said. “I’m seeing people still having to buy and sell. This isn’t necessarily bad timing.”Even with Friday’s stock swoon and the pandemic, Musk and Tesla are having a pretty good 2020.The shares surged 68 per cent this year through Friday, helping to boost his net worth by US$8.3 billion, the second-most of anyone in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person. Musk ranks No. 24 on the list, with a US$35.9 billion fortune. Tesla rebounded Monday, advancing 4.7 per cent to US$734.08 at 1:38 p.m. in New York.Musk bought the two homes in 2012 and 2013 for a total of about US$24 million.

That’s why we created Ask BNN Bloomberg, where you can have your personal finance questions answered by industry professionals.

Leaving job due to closures  Brooke in Penticton, B.C.: When my workplace had to close its doors due to the COVID-19 situation in my university town, they sent out forms from the Canadian government saying to sign your name if you agree that this is a temporary layoff and will, within the next five months, come back to work for the business if and when they need me. However, I could not sign it because I had to move back home since the university shut down and I couldn’t live there anymore while paying for groceries when I didn’t have work. So for me to sit around and wait for them to be able to re-open again was not an option. Therefore, me signing that means legally I quit. But I did not quit because I didn’t want to work there. I didn’t sign because I won’t be around in the next five months because I had to move home due to COVID-19. Now the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) requirements say you aren’t eligible if you voluntarily quit your job, but there are certain reasons that are exempted like if you had to quit to take care of a loved one who is sick from COVID-19, or if you yourself are sick. It also says that reasons to stop working are not limited to these specific COVID-19 reasons. Would I still be eligible? I could not sign the temporary layoff because I had to move back to my family home and away from the business I worked at due to COVID-19. Also, eligibility was expanded to seasonal workers. Every summer I have a job at a beach restaurant, and of course it is not opening. Does this count as a seasonal work? (April 18, 2020) Kelley Keehn, consumer advocate at FP Canada: I’m so sorry to hear about your situation but from what you’ve described, it does not sound at all like you’ve quit your job. You in fact did your best, you weren’t able to sign that letter of termination because you had to physically leave so I think the government would probably agree that in that circumstance you did not quit. Please make sure you take copious notes and record all the dates of all these occurrences but from the sounds of it, as long as you’ve met the eligibility requirements of earning $5,000 in 2019 or the last 12 months, it sounds that you would be eligible for the CERB program. (April 21, 2020) CERB eligibility for seniors collecting pension Rodney in Brandon, Man.: I am a retired person who collects a pension, however I was working as a casual employee for the Manitoba government until September 2019 when I was laid off. I did receive in 2019 over $5,000 in wages. I also worked enough hours to qualify for employment Insurance (EI) which I did, and it ran out on February 19, 2020. So my question is, does being retired and collecting a pension once a month disqualify me from being eligible for the CERB? Any information on this would be greatly appreciated. (April 18, 2020) Melissa Leong, financial speaker and author of the finance guide, Happy Go Money: The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) provides $2,000 every four weeks, for up to 16 weeks for anyone who has lost their income due to COVID-19. So let’s go through a couple of the requirements to see if you’re eligible. Number one: You have to have made $5,000 in the last 12 months or in 2019, so you’re good there. Number two: According to some recent government updates, if you have exhausted Employment Insurance (EI) between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020 you are eligible to apply for the CERB. Finally, you’re collecting a pension. Pension income - CPP, OAS - they’re not considered employment income for the purposes of the CERB so you are eligible to apply. (April 22, 2020) Will pandemic rescue measures cause high inflation? Bobby in Toronto: I am a retired senior depending on income from interest and dividend. With so much debt created from the pandemic, what will the government do? Will this create high inflation like in the 70s? (April 17, 2020) Beata Caranci, chief economist and senior vice president of TD Bank Group: Relative to the size of the economy, government spending is roughly six times the amount that was offered during the global financial crisis. However, the economic contraction is also deeper than recent historical experiences. The government has oriented funds towards temporary measures that will naturally expire if the economy avoids a prolonged recession. This, along with a recovery in tax receipts, would help stabilize debt-to-GDP levels, provided the government can resist turning temporary measures into permanent ones. In an optimistic scenario, where the economy begins to reopen within the next month, it will likely take a year or more for Canadian activity to return to pre-crisis levels. The job market is less likely to fully recover. This leaves the balance of inflation risks to the downside due to a demand gap. In a less optimistic scenario that takes the economy upwards of two years or more to recover to pre-crisis levels, downward pressure on inflation will build and governments will have to spend even more on income stabilizers, leaving deficit fighting for another day (and generation). (April 22, 2020) Should I get a reverse mortgage? Cecile in Burns Lake, B.C.: The federal government has not given any relief money for seniors other than drawing out retirement funds at a reduced income tax rate. Would this be the time for seniors to apply for the Chip Reverse Mortgage? (April 18, 2020) Rob McLister, founder of RateSpy.com: Reverse mortgages are meant for seniors who want to stay in their home, need cash and have no better options. Assuming you genuinely need the money and are willing to pay reverse mortgage rates to get it, step one is to rule out all other options. Those might include downsizing, getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC), finding a renter or roommate, selling other assets, selling your home to loved ones at a below-market price with a leaseback agreement, and so on. Barring alternatives, a reverse mortgage is an easy source of fast liquidity. But don’t tie yourself to one lender. Compare both HomeEquity Bank (founder of CHIP) to Equitable Bank, its much newer competitor. The former will lend you more money with less restrictions, but generally has higher rates. The latter lends less money, as a percentage of your home value, but has lower rates and fees. As we speak, the best reverse mortgage rates will save you 1.25 percentage points of interest annually. That means $15,500 less interest on a $200,000 lump-sum reverse mortgage over five years. (April 22, 2020) Waiting on a SIN renewal amid COVID-19 Iqbal in Brampton, Ont.: I want to know if I am eligible to apply for CERB. Last year I worked at McDonald’s part-time as I was a full-time student. Then I graduated in November and applied for a post-graduation work permit since at the time I was not eligible to work. My employer told me to come back to work when I got my work permit. I received my work permit on March 6, 2020 and received it in mail on March 12, 2020. The next day Service Canada was closed and I couldn’t renew my social insurance number (SIN) so I won’t be able to return to work. They are accepting only mail application for SIN numbers, which takes one month, so I want to know if am eligible because I am meeting all other conditions. (April 18, 2020) Dilys D’Cruz, VP and head of wealth management at Meridian Credit Union: Sounds like you’re a foreign student working in Canada with a temporary SIN. Now the delay in getting your SIN renewed likely is not going to meet the eligibility for the CERB, which was designed to help Canadians who were working and directly impacted COVID-19 and unable to work and seen a reduction in your income and/or hours. And so in this case, you weren’t working prior to COVID-19 and will likely not qualify for the CERB. But the good news is, it sounds like you got you’ve got your paperwork on the go and likely just maybe a week or two away from getting your SIN renewed, and it also sounds like your employer has an opportunity waiting for you. So I wish you the best with that and one thing that I do suggest is you go onto the CERB website. Things are changing so rapidly, the government is continuously implementing new programs to help Canadians and things get updated regularly so stay informed, check out the website. Good luck! (April 23, 2020) Options for small businesses Mas in Kelowna, B.C.: I run a small services business, which has been completely shut down due to the virus. But I still have to pay overhead charges like rental, insurance and some interest to the bank. I also work another job which I am still able to carry on as it is more IT-based. Because of the job, I am not able to qualify for the CERB. Can you please advise what would be the way forward for me? Should I close my business permanently? I am not able to pay my bills. (April 22, 2020) Barry Choi, personal finance blogger for Moneywehave.com: The prime minister just announced Ottawa may propose a Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses that will lower your rent by 75 per cent for April, May and June. To qualify, your rent must be less than $50,000 a month. In addition, you must have ceased operations or seen your income drop by 70 per cent compared to pre-COVID-19 income. The government is working with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to cover 50 per cent of the rent, your landlord would cover 25 per cent and you would be responsible for the remaining 25 per cent. If the program goes through, it will be available in mid-May, so talk to your landlord if this will help you keep your business operating. That said, if the outstanding rent, insurance and other overhead costs are eating into your cash flow, it might make sense to cut your losses and close your business.

Some 213,000 were handled in the first nine days of the program, and total requests reached 500,000 by April 3.“People have had a chance now to catch their breath a little bit and take stock in their personal financial situation,” Neil Parmenter, president and chief executive officer of the association, said in an interview. He described the response in the first week as “unprecedented.”Initial demand may have been fuelled by unwarranted homeowner fears that the relief program was a “first-come, first-serve” limited-time offer combined with the approaching start of the month, when payments would be due, Parmenter said. The cooling pace of deferral requests doesn’t mean demand has peaked.“I don’t know if we can say it’s behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming in,” he said. “The traffic continues to be elevated from where it’d normally be.”I don't know if we can say it's behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming inCanada’s six largest banks have deferred about 12 per cent of the mortgages in their combined portfolios so far, and small and midsize banks have also deferred a “significant” number of the mortgages on their books, the association said. Some banks have reported that more than 90% of those seeking a deferral are approved.The cash flow freed up by Canadians from deferrals completed to date is about $778 million (US$561 million) a month, or $2.3 billion a quarter, according to estimates from the association using an average monthly mortgage payment of $1,326. That number will grow in the weeks ahead, as more deferral requests are processed, the association said.The federal government’s $25-billion Canada Emergency Business Account has also shown strong pickup, with the country’s five biggest banks approving more than 72,000 loans for small-business clients on Friday, the program’s first day. That’d be worth about $2.89 billion in loans, assuming clients took up the full $40,000 of interest-free government-backed loans offered to them.“We knew the demand was obviously going to be heavy,” Parmenter said of the small-business relief program.Bloomberg.com"
45,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Reed Stevenson,Michael Burry of 'The Big Short' slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm,Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself,-1,,-1,,2020-04-07,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg,"Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country’s  deepest-ever economic contractions, aren’t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.”“Economically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.”“Countries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.”Bloomberg.com"
2,BNN Bloomberg,Michelle Zadikian,"Mortgage market sees flurry of activity amid low rates, virus uncertainty","A perfect storm of lower interest rates, widespread layoffs and economic uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak has sent the mortgage finance market into overdrive.",-1,low rates,-1,,2020-03-27,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mortgage-market-sees-flurry-of-activity-amid-low-rates-virus-uncertainty-1.1412984,,"A perfect storm of lower interest rates, widespread layoffs and economic uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak has sent the mortgage finance market into overdrive. “There’s mass requests for refinancing. Two weeks ago, the story was lower rates and when you combine that with economic uncertainty, people want to refinance and grab those lower rates,” Ron Butler, founder of Butler Mortgage, told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview. Canadians have several options when it comes to refinancing their mortgage amid the outbreak. In addition to taking advantage of drastically lower interest rates following two emergency cuts from the Bank of Canada, they now have the choice of deferring their payments if they can prove financial hardship due to the virus. Samantha Brookes, chief executive officer of Mortgages of Canada, told BNN Bloomberg that she's getting more calls from clients wondering what their best options are based on the industries that they work in. Some options may include a deferral, getting an extra line of credit or just refinancing to ""keep the roof over their head.""   “I’ve had four clients in one day ask me ‘Am I going to lose my home?’” she said.  As many homeowners evaluate their payment options, some buyers are just flat-out walking away from deals because their situation has suddenly changed. “We’ve had some people coming up to their condition day and decided they don’t want to proceed because they’re afraid they might be laid off or they don’t want to proceed because they have been laid off,” Calgary-based mortgage broker Croft Axsen said. But the mortgage market is also showing signs of a significant divide happening – those looking to refinance or defer payments and those viewing the economic downturn as a real estate buying opportunity with home prices likely declining in the coming months. However, Butler thinks some people should hold off looking to buy a house in the near term as prices could continue to move lower.  “If it’s going to be a situation where if you’re closing on a property today, you’re probably going to be able to buy it for 10 per cent less down the line,” he said. “There are a lot of headwinds here.

According to the complaint, RBC said the REIT’s commercial mortgage-backed securities have “drastically declined” in value due to the crisis, allowing the bank to demand additional cash or securities to meet requirements.But the trust says the calls are entirely subjective and don’t actually reflect the true value of the CMBS. While many other banks have agreed not to pursue remedies against mortgage real estate investment trusts, RBC has refused — and planned to hold an auction Wednesday that included US$11 million of the trust’s assets, the lawsuit says.RBC declined to comment on the lawsuit.The coronavirus is wreaking havoc in the US$16-trillion U.S. mortgage market, which is suffering its worst turmoil in more than a decade. Firms that invest in mortgage-backed securities are facing margin calls and sinking valuations, forcing them to solicit offers on billions in assets in emergency sales.RBC “is hitting the accelerator to unlawfully seize and unload a large portfolio of plaintiffs’ assets at fire-sale prices into the seized markets which will have a cascading effect in the market for mortgage-based assets,” the lawsuit said.The bank’s auction “would not only dramatically and prejudicially underprice these securities to Plaintiffs’ detriment, but would also likely precipitate a chain reaction of other banks being pressured to foreclose on other mREITs’ pledged securities, all at prices informed by the fire sale that defendants seek to hold,” the trust said in the suit.The REIT is seeking a court order blocking the auction and stopping RBC from taking any actions against its assets “pending compliance with the parties’ agreements and current government guidance and regulations designed to stabilize the economy.”AG Mortgage Investment Trust announced Monday it failed to meet some margin calls and doesn’t expect to be able to meet future margin calls with its current financing. Eric Hagen, an analyst at KBW, said other firms are also likely facing margin calls “especially given the challenging overall environment for sourcing liquidity.”Shares of AG Mortgage Investment Trust rose 27 per cent to US$2.725 in New York Wednesday after earlier rising as much as 69 per cent amid a broad surge in REIT stocks.The case is AG MIT CMO v RBC (Barbados) Trading Corp. 20-cv-2547, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.Bloomberg.com"
3,Bloomberg News,Doug Alexander,OSFI unleashes $300B in lending capacity,Canada’s banking regulator has halted talks on changing its mortgage stress test as it eases capital requirements to free up $300 billion (US$215 billion) of lending capacity to help ensure financial stability during the coronavirus pandemic.,-1,,-1,,2020-03-13,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/osfi-unleashes-300b-in-lending-capacity-1.1405714,,"Canada’s banking regulator has halted talks on changing its mortgage stress test as it eases capital requirements to free up $300 billion (US$215 billion) of lending capacity to help ensure financial stability during the coronavirus pandemic. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions lowered the domestic stability buffer requirement for Canada’s key banks to 1 per cent of risk-weighted assets from the 2.25 per cent level set for the end of April. The buffer -- one of four capital requirements for the biggest banks -- will not increase for at least 18 months, according to the regulator. The action will reinforce the commercial banks’ ability to supply credit to the economy during any disruption related to Covid-19 and associated market conditions, OSFI Superintendent Jeremy Rudin said at a press conference Friday in Ottawa. “We are encouraging the institutions to use this capital as well as their liquidity buffers, as required.” Rudin said. Officials are ramping up support as Canada’s economy reels from both the coronavirus and plunging oil prices, with many economists now predicting the country is on the brink of recession. The move to shore up bank lending came as the Bank of Canada cut interest rates by another 50 basis points to 0.75 per cent and Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced a new facility to support funding markets for small- and medium-size businesses. ‘Earnings Headwinds’ “While the Canadian policy makers are trying to get ahead of the expected economic slowdown impact of the coronavirus, for the Canadian financials, the immediate impact of the cure may be worse than the disease,” Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken said in a note to clients. “The actions taken may have the impact of moderating the depth of a recession, but the implications of the rate cut means that earnings headwinds for almost all the financials have just begun.” Aiken said that banks will face earnings pressure from ongoing net interest margin compression, and the capital buffer changes won’t necessarily encourage lending in the near term. Index rose 16 per cent at the end of trading in Toronto, outpacing the 9.6 per cent rise of the country’s benchmark index as global efforts to fight a virus-induced slowdown swung into action. Canada’s big banks already surpass the regulatory requirements for guarding against against risks to the financial system. In addition to the domestic stability buffer, other capital requirements include a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital level, a capital conservation buffer and a surcharge for the six biggest banks deemed domestically significant. OSFI typically reviews the domestic stability buffer twice a year, in June and December. OSFI is also halting discussions on easing of the mortgage stress test rules -- part of the regulator’s move to suspend consultations on all new or revised guidance on rules due to the current developments and “strain on operations of financial firms,” according to Rudin. Canadian banks will continue to use the benchmark rate as currently published by the Bank of Canada, in gauging a borrower’s ability to take on a mortgage. Canada’s lenders “stand ready” to help customers affected by Covid-19, according to a statement by the Canadian Bankers Association, which represents more than 60 domestic and foreign banks in the country. Canadian banks are working closely with government and regulators to be ready to help Canadians weather economic disruptions, the association said."
5,Bloomberg News,Doug Alexander,RBC widens mortgage lead amid signs of Canadian housing revival,Royal Bank of Canada has widened its lead in mortgages against rival lenders as the nation’s housing market shows signs of renewed vigor.,0,,0,,2020-02-28,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/rbc-widens-mortgage-lead-amid-signs-of-canadian-housing-revival-1.1397356,,"Royal Bank of Canada has widened its lead in mortgages against rival lenders as the nation’s housing market shows signs of renewed vigor. The bank’s domestic mortgage book grew 8.6 per cent in the fiscal first quarter, the biggest year-over-year jump in more than a decade. None of Canada’s other big banks has achieved such a fevered growth rate in almost two years, with Royal Bank grabbing a greater portion of the $992.4 billion mortgage market spread among the country’s five largest lenders. Among those companies, Royal Bank’s market share is now 27.4 per cent. “It’s demonstrative of our investments both in digital and distribution and talent,” Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview after Royal Bank reported first-quarter results. “We had been adding resources in the field while some of our competition was reducing their face-to-face advice.” Royal Bank’s push comes as a rebound in housing takes hold. Home prices in some of Canada’s largest cities including Toronto have recently climbed to records amid a shortage of properties for sale. Including lenders outside the big banks, the nation’s mortgage market in December expanded 4.9 per cent from a year earlier to $1.63 trillion, Bank of Canada monthly data show. That marked a rebound from February 2019, when growth was the paltriest in 18 years. Royal Bank has pulled further ahead of competitors including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal, and even extended its lead over Bank of Nova Scotia, which has been No. 2 in mortgage growth since the latter half of 2018. At Scotiabank, mortgage balances rose 5.3 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in two years. Royal Bank is the country’s largest mortgage lender, based on an average balance of $271.8 billion in the first quarter. “We are bringing a broader spectrum of advice and solutions to our clients, and when we do that we expect to continue to increase market share,” Bolger said, adding that Royal Bank is wooing customers with internet-based tools including OJO Home, an artificial intelligence-powered property search for Greater Toronto, and MoveSnap, an online concierge service for moving-related tasks. Homebuying Season The mortgage-growth revival comes as the government tweaks loan-qualification “stress test” criteria and the spring homebuying season approaches. Bank executives, who have spent recent years dealing with the risks of an overheated housing market, are largely shrugging off such concerns this time around. “Sales activity has been solid, price performance is generally up in the market and it doesn’t feel overly frothy,” Bank of Montreal CFO Tom Flynn said in a phone interview this week. At Flynn’s bank, the domestic mortgage book rose 2.9 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2017, in what he said was a reflection of healthy market conditions. Toronto-Dominion’s domestic mortgage balances rose 3.5 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2016. “Definitely the volume of transactions in the market do seem to be picking up and the market does seem to be active again,” Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said in an interview, adding that he expects “mid-single-digit” growth rate in Canadian mortgage volumes for the rest of the year. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, once the market leader for mortgage growth, increased home-loan balances by just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter after seeing its book contract for most of last year. Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig promised improved growth by the end of the year as momentum builds. “Our goal is to be closer to market from a growth perspective,” CFO Hratch Panossian said in an interview. “We’re on track with that.”"

This comes after criticism that the policy was too tight and unfairly kept younger, first-time buyers out the market.The gap between the old qualifying rate and the new rate is about 30 basis points, which will allow the median household in Canada to buy $13,500 (US$9,800) in extra real estate, according to CIBC’s Benjamin Tal. That equates to less than a 3 per cent improvement in purchasing power, the bank’s deputy chief economist wrote Friday in a note to clients.“It’s becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it’s impossible to fight supply issues with demand tools,” Tal said. “Increased supply (rental or otherwise) is the only reasonable solution to the housing affordability crisis that many Canadians are facing.”While the existing qualification rule, introduced in 2016 for insured mortgages and extended in 2018 to the uninsured space, were effective in restoring balance to a market that seemed to be escalating out of control, a rebound in Canadian housing is underway. Home prices in some of the country’s largest cities such as Toronto climbed to fresh records recently, driven higher by dwindling inventories.It's becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it's impossible to fight supply issues with demand toolsTal’s comments were echoed by Neil McLaughlin, group head of personal and commercial banking at Royal Bank of Canada, who said Friday on a conference call with analysts the stress test change will have “quite a minimal impact.”“Our analysis so far looks like it would be about 25 to 30 basis points reduction in the qualifying rate,” McLaughlin said. “That would really translate into a fairly small increase in purchasing power for the average borrower, probably in the neighbourhood of about $20,000, $25,000 on an average mortgage.”He also agrees with Tal on what’s needed to address the affordability issue. “The lack of supply in the major urban markets is still the real focus for where the policy needs to go,” he said.Bloomberg.com"
7,Bloomberg News,Esteban Duarte,TD markets first RMBS from a top-six Canadian bank,"A unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank is moving ahead with what would be the first widely-marketed Canadian private-label residential mortgage-backed securities deal from one of the country’s six largest banks, according DBRS Morningstar.",0,,0,,2020-02-13,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/td-markets-first-rmbs-from-a-top-six-canadian-bank-1.1389782,,"A unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank is moving ahead with what would be the first widely-marketed Canadian private-label residential mortgage-backed securities deal from one of the country’s six largest banks, according DBRS Morningstar. The transaction will be backed by a $688.3 million pool of home loans that were originated by three smaller lenders, according to a DBRS Morningstar document. TD Securities plans to offer $450 million of top-rated securities with an expected maturity around Feb. 2023, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. It will be a milestone in creating a market to help disperse housing debt risk. The last RMBS deal widely marketed in Canadian dollars was conducted by a Home Capital subsidiary in September, when it issued $425 million of securities that pooled near-prime and alternative-A mortgages. The weighted-average borrower credit score of that deal was 741, while that of TD’s Prime Structured Mortgage Trust will be 793, according DBRS Morningstar, which rated both deals. “The mortgage pool compares favorably with recent issuances seen in the Canadian market in terms of credit-score characteristics,” rating company analysts including Tim O’Neil wrote in the Feb. 11 report. A nationwide roadshow is taking place this week before the deal books are opened, so definitive terms still have to be set, people familiar with the matter said. The deal will be the first RMBS in Canada to aggregate mortgages originated by other lenders, mimicking a technique used in the securitization of mortgages guaranteed by the federal agency known as Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, DBRS Morningstar said in an email to Bloomberg News. The volume of residential mortgages in Canada increased 5.1 per cent in the twelve months through Nov. 30, according to data compiled by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI. That’s more than three times the country’s GDP growth in 2019. Uninsured mortgages grew 12 per cent to $759.4 billion. In contrast, insured loans declined 4.6 per cent to $469.5 billion over the same period, as the Federal government has sought in recent years to limit taxpayer exposure to the real estate sector. Lenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and expected return, and there’s been little evidence that risky mortgages have become a prominent feature in Canada’s RMBS market. In addition, mortgages are “full recourse” in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they’ve walked away from the property. With a securitization deal the seller of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital needed to be set aside to cover potential losses should they meet certain conditions, which includes transferring significant credit risk to third parties. The seller would need to hold capital for any securitization tranches retained. TD Securities will offer only the safest portion of the transaction, specifically the bullet-pay class A notes, retaining the mezzanine and junior pieces, a person familiar with the matter said. Back in 2017, Bank of Montreal created a $1.96-billion RMBS deal, though much of the securities were purchased and retained by the bank itself, Moody’s Investors Service said at that time. The Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of bond-market professionals, has been working for around two years to expand interest in RMBS. Part of their efforts include a proposed public mortgage database, the details of which would be ironed out by a working group co-chaired by the central bank, the CMHC, representatives from the six largest banks and the Canadian Bankers Association on behalf of the smaller players, according to a presentation given in October."

CIBC also increased its sales force of mobile mortgage advisers to 920 from 840 — still down from a height of 1,200 — and made efforts to “ignite” staff in branches who weren’t meeting expectations on mortgage sales, he said.“All of that has delivered some pretty positive results in the months of November and December, that we believe will continue to deliver into the year,” Dodig said at the RBC Capital Markets banking conference in Toronto. “Our growth over the course of the year will look more market-like on the mortgage front.”CIBC’s once-leading mortgage growth faltered last year following bank efforts to cool the pace, which led to three straight quarters of declining balances in home loans. CIBC’s Canadian mortgage balances were little changed at $202 billion (US$155 billion) in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.The decline contributed to what Dodig described Tuesday as “some softness” in CIBC’s personal and small business division, which contributed to “a pause on earnings growth” in the last fiscal year. Dodig said he sees adjusted earnings growth in the “low-single-digit range” for 2020 as the company works back to its medium-term target range of 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth.In terms of acquisitions, Dodig said CIBC isn’t looking to do anything “dramatic” in the U.S., though “tuck-in acquisitions” in wealth management are likely.Bloomberg.com"

Still, benchmark prices kept climbing, rising 0.5 per cent last month to record highs and bringing gains to 7.3 per cent from the previous year, the fastest pace of year-over-year growth since 2017.Toronto’s housing market has tightened considerably over the past year as buyers took advantage of lower interest rates and adjusted to mortgage stress tests, but there are fewer homes to be bought.

Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank earn $14 million (US$10.6 million) a year from each of their domestic branches, distancing themselves from smaller competitors in the process.Bank branches are evolving as customers increasingly rely on mobile phones, websites and automated teller machines for routine transactions, with the drudgery of standing in line to cash a paycheque or shift money between accounts largely left to a bygone era.Canada’s banks have reacted accordingly, shrinking branch sizes, adopting the newest technology and turning once counter-bound tellers into roaming advisers armed with tablets to sell high-margin products and mortgages. That’s paying off: All of the big Canadian banks have posted increases in annual revenue per branch in each of the past three years, and sales have soared substantially from a decade ago.“We’re growing our investment in innovative formats: university campuses, hospitals, newcomer centres, which is helping us grow our client base,” Royal Bank Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview. “As we have ramped up our leading digital and mobile applications, customers and clients still like to come to branches for advice.”Royal Bank is Canada’s leader, with 1,201 branches across the country — four more than a decade ago, even with the addition of digital-banking options during that period. Annual revenue per branch has soared 70 per cent since 2009. Technology has allowed branch employees to focus on dispensing advice to customers rather than merely handling routine transactions, according to Bolger.“We continue to free up time for our banking advisers,” he said. “That is helping us to continue to expand our market share, which will then in turn result in higher productivity per branch.”Rival Toronto-Dominion, meanwhile, has 1,091 branches nationwide, slightly fewer than a decade ago. Like Royal Bank, it has seen a surge in per-branch revenue, with a 66 per cent increase since 2009. The ratio for each of bank was calculated by dividing annual revenue from Canadian personal-and-commercial banking by the number of domestic branches at the end of each fiscal year.“People have been speculating about the future of branches, but we’ve been very clear in our strategy that branches are important to us — they’re an important contact point for customers who need human advice and human touch,” Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said. “We continue to see them as a very important part of our strategy.”Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce brings in an average of $10 million in yearly sales, up about 53 per cent from a decade ago, for each of its 1,024 branches.“We continue to improve our advisory capabilities and focus on having conversations with clients to understand their needs and to provide them with products and services that they need,” said CIBC CFO Hratch Panossian. “That has had some positive momentum.”Canada’s six largest banks operate 5,578 branches domestically, 2.9 per cent fewer than a decade ago. While the decline isn’t as dramatic as was once predicted by those who thought ATMs and mobile banking would spell an end to bricks-and-mortar locations, branches also aren’t keeping pace with population growth.Canada had 20 branches for every 100,000 adults as of 2018, down from about 25 before the 2008 financial crisis, according to the World Bank. The U.S., in comparison, had about 31 branches per 100,000 adults, down from 35.We've been very clear in our strategy that branches are important to us — they're an important contact point for customers who need human advice and human touchBank of Nova Scotia reduced its domestic network the most, trimming 6.9 per cent of its branches from a decade ago, to 949 today. Those branches generate an average of $11 million in annual revenue, an amount that has climbed steadily in the past six years.“Scotiabank has been adding adviser roles to branches,” spokesman Clancy Zeifman said in an email. “We have also been investing in technologies and tools to help our employees be more productive, including removing manual processes so they can spend more time focusing on our customers.”While branches remain important for Bank of Montreal, CFO Tom Flynn said he expects a gradual decline in both the number of branches and average size amid a push toward digital banking. Canada’s fourth-largest lender has 891 domestic locations, which generate about $9 million in annual sales on average, a 55 per cent jump from 2009.“We want to be close to people when they’re doing transactions that are bigger and really important to them,” Flynn said. “At the same time, total branch traffic is down, given the digital migration, and in response to that we have been and will continue to take the average square footage of our branch network down.”National Bank of Canada has the lowest annual revenue per branch, at $8.2 million for each of its 422 locations, though that’s still 60% higher than a decade ago. The Montreal-based lender, the smallest among Canada’s Big Six banks, may lag behind its larger rivals partly because of its regional focus.“We are located in the province of Quebec, where people are less in debt — they borrow less,” Jean Dagenais, senior vice president of finance, said in an interview. With property values lower than in other parts of Canada and mortgages smaller as a result, “the volume of loans per branch is lower than a big bank in the Toronto area.”Bloomberg.com"

According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country’s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent in the prior period.It’s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation’s households cope with high debt levels.Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn’t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That’s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January.Canada’s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they’ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3 per cent since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased 1 per cent in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal.You don't have a domestic demand story that's strongBusiness investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada’s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures.Consumption has long propelled Canada’s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that’s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigour is most apparent in a retail sector that’s seen volumes flat over the past year.“You don’t have a domestic demand story that’s strong,” said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.One bright spot in the GDP numbers could be housing, which has rebounded as borrowing costs decline and buyers adjust to tighter mortgage rules. Home sales rose 7.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest quarterly pace since the end of 2017. Most economists estimate residential investment picked up for a second straight quarter.Bloomberg.com"

Toronto was a major drag, posting a 2.9 per cent decline, the biggest drop since February. Still, renewed momentum in Vancouver and Calgary were sources of strength, with sales growing 5.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively. The Ottawa market continued to expand at a moderate pace, while Montreal was flat.Residential housing has rebounded this year as borrowing costs fell and buyers adjusted to tighter mortgage rules introduced at the beginning of 2018. With markets also adapting to the impact of taxes on foreign buyers in Vancouver and Toronto, Canadian real estate activity has climbed back above its 10-year average and is contributing to economic growth.“The solid results simply drum home the point that the housing sector has returned to the status of a growth driver, rather than the growth dimmer it had been over the past two years,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to clients. “The related pick-up in household borrowing is a key reason that the Bank of Canada has been a bystander to the global rate-cut parade.”Benchmark prices also continued their recovery, rising 1.8 per cent from a year earlier, with a 0.6 per cent gain on the month. Though Vancouver, Calgary and other western cities have lower prices than a year ago, central Canadian markets are tightening. Toronto’s prices are up 5.6 per cent, while Montreal’s rose 7.5 per cent. Prices in the capital city of Ottawa are up 10.3 per cent.The sales to new listings ratio ticked up to 64 per cent, a sign markets are tilting in favor of sellers, CREA said. Bloomberg.com"

The Toronto-based lender traded at $28.86 at 1:26 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and has been hovering at levels last seen in February 2017, before the stock plunged as Ontario’s securities regulator accused the company of misleading shareholders over falsified mortgage applications.Alternative lenders including Home Capital and Equitable Group Inc. have seen their stocks surge this year as the pace of mortgage growth picked up during the spring home-buying season, and home sales recovered in major cities including Toronto and Vancouver.The “significant” share price appreciation of the alternative lenders is reflective of improving housing conditions — particularly in Greater Toronto — as well as a benign credit environment and robust mortgage growth outlook, CIBC analyst Marco Giurleo said in a Nov. 1 note to clients. He upgraded Home Capital to “outperformer” based on the company’s “path to double-digit profitability,” a strong mortgage growth outlook and attractive valuation.Home Capital’s stock went into a free-fall in the weeks after the regulator’s allegations, fuelled by short-selling and a run on deposits. Shares sunk to as low as $5.85 in May that year, before Warren Buffett stepped in to buy a 38 per cent stake in Home Capital and backstopped the lender with a $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) credit line through Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Berkshire has since cashed in as the stock has recovered.Home Capital is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings results on Nov. 13, with analysts expecting the company to post adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share.While Home Capital’s shares have recovered, the lender’s assets and mortgage book haven’t quite reached their pre-crisis levels. The company had $18.5 billion of assets at the end of the second quarter, down from a peak of $21 billion at the beginning of 2017, while single-family residential mortgages were $10.9 billion compared with about $11.3 billion two years earlier.Bloomberg.com"

This is due to the Liberal government’s already budgeted spending increases which the parliamentary budget office projects will increase the deficit to $21 billion this year and $23 billion in 2020, from $14 billion in 2018.The Liberals are actually promising to add to that spending, and anticipate their deficits will jump to about $27 billion next year, exceeding 1 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2012. The Conservatives meanwhile will adhere to the current deficit projection through 2020.Beyond 2020, a key policy divide emerges on closing the budget gap. Trudeau plans to run deficits of more than $20 billion every year during a second mandate, increasing the projected debt by $32 billion over that time.The Conservatives argue this is an irresponsible approach, because it would cause future generations to pay for the increased public debt through higher taxes. They vow instead to close the budget gap within five years by cutting foreign aid and corporate handouts, as well as by expanding the time horizon for planned infrastructure spending, which would reduce the annual amount spent on large projects.Most individual Canadians will pay lower taxes, while corporations will pay a bit more. The most expensive campaign pledges for both parties are personal income tax cuts. The Liberals are pledging to raise the threshold under which no taxes are paid. The Conservatives plan to lower the rate of the lowest tax bracket. The cost for both is about $6 billion annually by 2023.While this is the main tax pledge for the Liberals, whose platform is more spend-heavy, the Conservatives are also planning a series of other tax cuts for households that will bring the total cost of their tax reductions to about $10 billion annually.Both parties, however, are planning to finance some of their measures by tapping corporate coffers. The Liberals plan to close corporate tax loopholes, while the Conservatives have pledged to cut corporate welfare — much of which comes in the form of tax credits. Both parties want to tax tech giants. These additional costs to corporations are marginal, and pale in comparisons to the higher corporate tax proposals made by the smaller left-leaning parties.The Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the carbon tax introduced by Trudeau’s government earlier this year on holdout provinces with no carbon pricing. The Liberals plan to raise the minimum price provinces need to apply to greenhouse gas emissions to $50 a ton by 2022, from $20 a ton now, but the current program has considerable exemptions for large emitters. The Conservatives — who have adopted the same emission cut targets as the Liberals — want to shift the burden to large corporate emitters.Both main parties want to build the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which the Trudeau government bought last year for $4.5 billion after Kinder Morgan Inc. walked away. This project, anyhow, is out of the hands of politicians and in the hands of the courts.The bigger debate is whether the Trans Mountain pipeline — if it gets built at all — would be the country’s last. The Conservatives claim the Liberals have put so many obstacles in the way of future development that no new energy infrastructure will ever be built, and have pledged to repeal tougher environmental and regulatory oversight while promoting an energy corridor across the country. The Liberals have shown little enthusiasm for new pipelines beyond Trans Mountain, and will face a major challenge even building that if they find themselves in a minority government needing the support of anti-pipeline parties.Residential real estate is one of the hottest topics of the campaign, with all major parties saying they’ll make it easier for Canadians to buy a home. Liberals are pledging to make their first-time home buyer incentive program — in which a government agency chips in on the downpayment — more generous. The Conservatives are planning to extend the maximum mortgage amortization period to 30 years for first time buyers and change controversial lending rules — the so-called stress tests — introduced under the current government.The New Democratic Party, currently running third in the polls in terms of popular vote and which could play an important role in a minority government, is planning to create half a million affordable housing units and scrap the federal sales tax on construction of rental space.The surge of immigrants, along with temporary workers and international students, into the country has become a major driver of growth at a time when there are worries about the impact of high household debt levels and a global economic slowdown. The Liberals have announced a target to bring immigration to 350,000 by 2021, levels that haven’t been hit in more than a century — which Scheer has indicated he will accept.Canada’s small businesses can expect some relief no matter who wins. The Liberals are hoping to win back favour by promising to eliminate a double taxation on credit card transactions by doing away with “swipe fees” on sales taxes that merchants pay to credit card companies. This would save merchants around $500 million a year.The Conservatives are pledging to reverse Liberal tax changes for private corporations that outraged the small business community last year.Bloomberg.com"
87,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Kevin Orland and Chris Fournier,From binge to bust: A Canadian oil town lines up at the food bank,Fort McMurray has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing,0,,0,,2019-10-11,https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/from-binge-to-bust-a-canadian-oil-town-lines-up-at-the-food-bank,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/food-bank.jpg,"Dan Edwards watched Fort McMurray, Alberta, turn into the insolvency capital of Canada from a brown brick warehouse on King Street, home to the Wood Buffalo Food Bank.Ten years ago, about 2,000 people came by every month for jars of peanut butter and cans of soup. Now, he and his staff help feed four times that. Before, the clientele was mostly folks struggling to pay rents that shot up during the oil boom. Today, it’s often men and women who were living high before the bust. Sometimes, they pull up in shiny pickups purchased just a year or two ago.“You never know who’s going to walk through your door,” said Edwards, the food bank’s director. “Individuals that have degrees and education and skills — but the jobs just aren’t what they were.”Once the booming heart of the country’s energy industry, the little city of 75,000 in northeastern Alberta has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing. Fat paycheques and generous overtime earlier this decade fuelled big spending on customized pickups and million-dollar homes. With work drying up, the bill has come due.Consumer insolvency filings in the Fort McMurray district climbed 39 per cent in 2018, the largest percentage increase in Canada, federal data show. Claims against property, the first step in the foreclosure process, surged almost tenfold over the past three years, according to court records. The city’s 90-day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans climbed to 1.75 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.12 per cent nationally, according to Equifax Canada.The five-year slump that’s cut oil prices in half since 2014 has been a driver in the bust. What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oilsands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oilsands as a “carbon bomb” that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.Stewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada’s federal election later this month. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and pledges to remove regulations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta’s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.In May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.’s Fort Hills oilsands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.Richardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He’d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.After the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he’s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as cancelling his family’s cable subscription.“I spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,” Richardson, 42, said. He’s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. “I never got into all the toys. I’m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn’t have to sell everything off like some other people. I’ve seen a lot of that. It’s like a fire sale.”The energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It’s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.The potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oilsands are the world’s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested $210.1 billion (US$157.7 billion), more than last year’s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day. Canada shot up from the world’s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest, overtaking Iran, Mexico and Norway.It was a heady time.Tax revenue and corporate sponsorships paid for a revamp of the Fort McMurray International Airport, improvements to schools, top-notch hockey facilities and a gleaming new recreation centre, where Carrie Underwood was a recent headliner.The city’s population doubled as workers crowded in from around the country, sending rents and home prices surging and prompting a cascade of typical boomtown challenges, from crazy traffic to crowded schools. Companies, desperate for labour, threw six-figure salaries at low-skill jobs and covered commuting costs for roughnecks and people from as far away as Canada’s Atlantic Coast. Median annual household incomes more than doubled from 2001 to 2011, to about $181,000.Then oil prices tanked. The pipeline plans stalled. International giants, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sold off their major oilsands assets. Capital investments are on track to decline for a fifth straight year to an estimated $12 billion this year, about one-third of the 2014 level, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.Several operators — Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and a few others — are still active and generally profitable. But they’ve managed that by cutting costs, including, of course, that of labour.“People aren’t getting the overtime that they used to get, or they’re not getting any overtime at all,” said Sandra Landry, an insolvency trustee at MNP Ltd.If things weren’t bad enough when oil bottomed around US$26 a barrel in early 2016, the largest wildfire in recent history swept through the Fort Mac area that May. It forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses, making it the country’s costliest natural disaster.“The housing market is down, there’s the economic downturn and there’s still the recovery from the fire,” said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. Home prices remain 44 per cent below the recent peak.Sean O’Byrne moved to Fort Mac from Grande Prairie, Alberta, after the fire to open a branch of a friend’s siding business to repair damaged houses. That work dried up in November. Now he’s selling cars, making far less than the $1,000 a day he could rake in with the siding business; customers at the General Motors dealership are no longer trading in for new models every two years. He and his wife have cut back on travel and moved to a cheaper apartment closer to their children’s school, saving $900 in rent, he said while sipping coffee in a Tim Hortons doughnut shop facing a forested area, where charred trees stick out among new growth.“People aren’t spending money like they used to,” he said.They likely won’t be in the near future. There are only a few projects on the horizon that would create many new jobs. Teck Resources Ltd.’s proposed $20-billion Frontier mine is in the early stages of the regulatory-approval process. Imperial Oil Ltd., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., has put its long-planned $2.6-billion Aspen mine on hold, waiting to see if the pipeline situation improves.There aren’t many bets being laid that it will. More than a few folks would rather it not. Since the frenzy died down, traffic has returned to normal, in part because the oil money helped build a new bridge, over the Athabasca river. The unemployment rate, which skyrocketed to around 10 per cent in 2016, has settled down to 6.3 per cent mostly a function of workers decamping for more promising prospects.“That massive boom and gold-rush mentality that took place — I would rather not relive that,” said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus, adding the entire industry has learned the benefits of measured growth.These days, the company will only consider expansion projects that will be profitable with the benchmark U.S. oil price at US$45 a barrel, about US$10 less than the current level. Some oilsands projects undertaken a decade ago required US$100 a barrel to break even.John Hickey is also content with the slowdown. A mechanic who works on used oil-industry vehicles, he lost his house in the wildfire. Two years ago, a builder quoted him $500,000. The offers keep moving down, and he’s waiting for one to get to $200,000 or so before going ahead.In the meantime, he’s sharing a one-bedroom condo with a friend, sleeping in a tent in the living room to give himself a bit of privacy. He still has work and has always lived within his means, a lesson for places like Fort Mac that can see the money go as quickly as it came, he said.Too many, he said, “made a lifestyle based on an economy that wasn’t sustainable.”Bloomberg.com"

Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million (US$1.48 million) for a 1,163 square foot three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000.“They’re selling out like crazy,” said Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. “We had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn’t 100 per cent get what we wanted.”A spokeswoman for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch.Canada’s housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about US$10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent in September from last year.In contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012. Sales have also declined over the past two years.We're having the best back-to-back month since 2017New regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018. Those appear to have been largely absorbed — aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labour market. That’s put housing affordability front and centre in the federal election campaign.“I worked 90 hours in one week,” said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real-estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. “The pre-sale market is on fire again but resale has picked up too: We’re having the best back-to-back month since 2017.”Canada’s population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto’s booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city’s many universities and colleges.Supply is lagging demand with even the International Monetary Fund this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home.“The demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,” said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at Greybrook Capital, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. “When you couple those together, that’s an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it’s rental or housing.”Both the Liberal and Conservative parties are promising to make home buying more affordable on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals.Though the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the RE/MAX broker, said.They really need to revisit that stress test — it's causing people a lot of stress“No one really knows what to expect: Who’s going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules? Because they really need to revisit that stress test — it’s causing people a lot of stress,” Borg said.Prices in Calgary and Vancouver are still below recent records, down 5.9 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, according to Teranet-National Bank Home Price Indexes.Lofty home prices have pushed many prospective buyers into the rental market, where vacancy rates are at historically low levels and rents continue to rise.“Despite purpose-built apartment construction rising four-fold since 2014, rental supply is unlikely to come close to demand in the coming years,” Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report last month. “A deliberate policy to boost rental supply is needed — with specific targets and incentives to achieve them.”The bank estimates the number of renter households will jump by an average of 22,200 per year in Toronto. To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year.The federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what’s needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said.Bloomberg.com"

Principal and compound interest don’t have to be paid back until you sell the home or die. To keep the loan in good standing, homeowners only need to pay property tax and insurance, and maintain the home in good repair.“We’ve only been in this market for 18 months, but applications are jumping,” and have tripled over the past year, Andrew Moor, chief executive officer at Equitable Group Inc., said in an interview. The company, which operates Equitable Bank, sees the reverse mortgage sector expanding by about 25 per cent a year. “Canadians are getting older and there is an opportunity there.”Outstanding balances on reverse mortgages have more than doubled in less than four years to $3.12 billion (US$2.37 billion), excluding foreign currency amounts, according to June data from the country’s banking regulator. Although they represent less than one percentage point of the $1.2 trillion of residential mortgages issued by chartered banks, they’re growing at a much faster pace. Reverse mortgages rose 22 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier, versus 4.8 per cent for the total market.The fact that these niche products are growing so quickly offers a glimpse into how some seniors are becoming part of Canada’s new debt reality. After a decades-long housing boom, the nation has the highest household debt load in the Group of Seven, one reason Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz may be reluctant to join the global monetary-policy easing trend.More seniors are entering retirement with debt and the cost of rent has shot up in many cities, making downsizing difficult amid hot real estate markets. Reverse mortgages offer a new source of income.Canada’s big five banks have so far shied away from the product. Only two lenders offer them in Canada. HomeEquity Bank, whose reverse mortgage has been on the market for 30 years, dominates the space with $3.11 billion on its books. Equitable Bank, a relatively new player, has $10.1 million. Shares in parent Equitable Group have surged 75 per cent to a record this year.Critics say reverse mortgages are a high-cost solution that should only be used as a last resort.“When they think of their cash flow, they’re not going to get kicked out of their house, but in reality, it really has the ability to erode the asset of the borrower,” Shawn Stillman, a broker at Mortgage Outlet, said by phone from Toronto.Interest rates are typically much higher than those for conventional mortgages. For example, HomeEquity Bank and Equitable Bank charge 5.74 per cent for a five-year fixed mortgage. Conventional five-year fixed mortgages are currently being offered online for as low as 2.4 per cent.Atul Chandra, chief financial officer at HomeEquity Bank, said the higher rates are justified because the lender doesn’t receive any payments over the course of the loan.“Our time horizon for getting the cash is much longer, and generally the longer you wait for your cash to come back to you, the more you need to charge,” Chandra said in a telephone interview.Executives at HomeEquity Bank and Equitable say they are focusing on educating people about reverse mortgages to avoid mistakes that were made in the U.S. during the housing crisis — including aggressive sales tactics.While delinquency rates on regular mortgages are still low for seniors, they were the highest among all age groups in the first quarter, at 0.36 per cent, according to data from the federal housing agency. The 65-plus demographic took over as the most delinquent group at the end of 2015. For non-mortgage debt, delinquency rates in the 65-plus category have seen the biggest increases over the past several quarters, Equifax data show.Reverse mortgages aren’t included in typical delinquency rate measures — borrowers can’t be late on payments because there are no payments — but they can be in default if they fail to pay taxes or insurance, or let the home fall into disrepair. However default rates for reverse mortgages have remained stable, even with the strong growth in volumes, said HomeEquity’s Chandra.According to a scenario provided by HomeEquity Bank, a borrower who took out a reverse mortgage of $150,000 at an interest rate of 5.74 per cent would owe $199,058 five years later. A home worth $750,000 when the reverse mortgage was taken out would be worth $869,456 five years later, assuming 3 per cent annual home price appreciation, meaning total equity would have grown by about $70,000.Bloomberg.com"

The bank’s domestic mortgage book has contracted in each quarter this year.Dodig said Canada’s fifth largest bank is focusing on the long game in these “unprecedented” times.“Political leadership tends to be on the angrier side, the more aggressive side; negative rates, trade wars,” Dodig said. “These aren’t good trends.”How negative interest rates will go, particularly in the U.S. and Canada, remains a question, he said. “I think we have to be prepared for that.”If things go really sideways, “because we can’t control the weather, we adjust our business investment and spending accordingly.

His efforts may be of little help to people in the country’s priciest cities.The national housing agency aims to spend up to $1.25 billion over three years subsidizing down payments for new lower- to middle-income buyers. Under the program, launched Monday, the government will pay up to 10 per cent of the purchase price in exchange for a stake in the home that would be paid back once it’s sold.The plan targets millennials, a growing cohort that’s getting squeezed out of Canada’s housing market. Home prices across the country jumped almost 40 per cent in the five years through July, largely driven by gains in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. Trudeau’s government expects the program will be used by 100,000 buyers, but brokers and analysts are skeptical that it will have much traction in the areas that need it most.“It’s a very narrowly-focused program,” Royal LePage President Phil Soper said by phone. “It’s just not a big enough slot of the market to move it.”While there are people who will benefit, the initiative is unlikely to help those looking in Toronto or Vancouver, where the average price of a home in July was $826,165 and $982,427, respectively.The program is available to buyers with annual household earnings of $120,000 or less, and the mortgage-to-income ratio can’t be more than four times the household income. Under those conditions, the maximum purchase price allowed is about $565,000.That puts markets such as Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, Greater Vancouver and Victoria out of reach of the average buyer, according to real estate website Zoocasa. Cities where home-shoppers would have more luck include Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, Zoocasa said.The program, called the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, also will encourage construction to help ease the country’s housing-supply shortage, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.“Despite the income and borrowing limits, we are confident this program can work in all markets, including Vancouver and Toronto,” Audrey-Anne Coulombe, a spokeswoman for CMHC, said in an email. The average prices in those cities “are not the same as starter-home prices. In the first quarter, 32 per cent of units sold in Toronto and 20 per cent in Vancouver were under $499,000.”Still, the effort may result in fewer than 5,000 purchases a year, according to a report by Mortgage Professionals Canada. Buyers’ resistance to give up equity in their homes and the requirement for mortgage insurance will be a substantial impediment, said Will Dunning, chief economist for the group.“The government says it wants to make homeownership more affordable and accessible, but its actions say otherwise,” he said. The proposals “to improve access are likely to have only small positive effects.”Bloomberg.com"

German and Italian benchmarks also sank to levels never seen before.There was a striking difference between this yield-suppressing rally and Friday’s: U.S. stocks are climbing Wednesday, but the S&P 500 suffered one of its worst losses of the year at the end of last week. Wednesday’s drop appears more driven by technical factors — such as investors needing to add long-term bonds to their portfolios as a hedge — not anxiety about the economy. Friday’s trading session was stirred up by Donald Trump’s threat to retaliate against Chinese tariffs.“The price action reflects a variety of market participants’ fears that their business model will be highly strained if rates fall to very low levels for an extended period,” Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said of Wednesday’s trading. “So they need to add duration as a hedge against the possibility of a very low rate environment.”Going long bonds is not a new trade. U.S. yields have been tumbling since the fourth quarter. The 30-year Treasury yielded as much as 3.46 per cent in November. But the move picked up steam after the Federal Reserve’s July 31 rate decision, when the central bank disappointed many investors by not signalling a dramatic easing of monetary policy. The escalation of the U.S.-China trade war didn’t help. The 30-year yield has sunk 59 basis points in August, the steepest monthly decline since 2011.As concerns grow over a global economic slowdown, the U.S. yield curve is sending an even louder recession signal. Two-year Treasuries yielded as much as 6.6 basis points more than the 10-year on Wednesday, the most deeply inverted this part of the curve has been since 2007.Strategists as BMO Capital Markets said in a note Wednesday that there remains “ample” room for 30-year Treasury rates to move lower. “The momentum of buying can continue and has continued, even though there hasn’t been a big buying catalyst,” BMO’s Ben Jeffery said in a phone interview. “People still want to lock in yields even though they are lower.”A practice known as convexity hedging, which has acted as a factor in depressing rates throughout the year, may also add fuel to the bond rally. When yields fall, the change in rates affects the duration of investors’ portfolios, and two sets of traders — those who buy mortgage bonds and those who use derivatives to bet on market stability — are acutely sensitive. To staunch losses, they often turn to interest-rate swaps, which in turn pushes Treasury yields down even more.Evidence shows the technical phenomenon is still alive and well. While yields on 30-year Treasuries dropped as low as 1.90 per cent on Wednesday, the rate on similar-maturity swaps got to 1.50 per cent. The 30-year swap spread — as the gap between the two measures is known — sits near a two-year low.Although investors in mortgage-backed securities might not be to blame for the latest moves, “other hedging flows are a major driver,” Cloherty said.Bloomberg.com"

Plucked from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s asset-management unit last year, he now leads a group of bankers and lawyers working day in and day out to ready the lender for the fateful day — still more than two years away — when the world’s most important reference rate is set to be phased out.The major Wall Street banks — not to mention insurers, money managers, law firms and advisory businesses — are all mobilizing employees around the globe in anticipation of Libor’s demise. The benchmark’s key role in financial markets — at last count it underpins more than US$350 trillion of mortgages, loans and derivatives across various currencies — means they’re being pulled from all corners of the industry. For Granet, the objective is clear: ensure that what many say is one of the most significant and complex transitions in the history of modern finance goes off without a hitch at Goldman Sachs.“My job completely changed,” said Granet, who now reports to Beth Hammack in treasury operations after spending the bulk of his almost 20-year career at the bank overseeing money-market funds. “It’s an international, complex intellectual challenge.”For decades, the London interbank offered rate was a convenient way to determine the cost of floating-rate debt around the world. It’s calculated from a daily survey of more than 15 large banks that estimate the price to borrow from each other without putting up collateral.But the trading behind those estimates has dried up, and coupled with the post-crisis discovery of rampant manipulation, U.K. officials two years ago signalled an end to Libor, saying they’ll stop compelling banks to submit quotes after 2021.The decision has spurred global regulators to push ahead with their own domestic funding-rate alternatives, and forced financial firms to figure how to extricate themselves from a benchmark so thoroughly entwined in global markets.At a June roundtable, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and others discussed how they’re establishing oversight committees, setting up joint steering groups and recruiting employees to build out their Libor transition capabilities. Consulting companies such as Oliver Wyman & Co. and Accenture Plc are advising clients on how to best manage the shift, while law firms such as Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft have helped craft fallback language for credit contracts that reference the benchmark.When Wells Fargo’s Brian Grabenstein became the head of the lender’s Libor transition office last year, he quickly realized that he needed to staff up. He now has a team of a dozen people coordinating meetings with the consumer banking and wealth management groups, among others, and running committees focused on various aspects of the transition — from legal documentation to communications.He estimates that 200 people at the bank have worked at least 10 hours on Libor over the past month.“Up until not that long ago, this was not on a lot of people’s radar,” Grabenstein said. “I quickly realized it wasn’t just one person’s full-time role, but in fact it was going to be a number of peoples’ full time jobs.”Along with colleague Readie Callahan, who heads communications strategy for the transition team, the pair have crisscrossed the U.S. in recent months, speaking with groups of as many as 50 corporate customers at a time about the shift. Wells Fargo is still working on its strategy to inform retail customers about the change, which will impact products such as adjustable-rate mortgages.“There’s a growing appreciation for how much work there is to be done,” Grabenstein said.It’s not just banks affected by Libor’s end. MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, faces exposure through its US$587 billion investment management portfolio. It tapped Jason Manske, head of global derivatives and liquid markets, as transition point man.The firm was an early adopter of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate — a new benchmark developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a potential Libor replacement — via its primary market issuance. It’s priced US$2.5 billion of SOFR-linked notes since the reference rate’s debut early last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Still, industry veterans are growing concerned about potential risks to financial stability in the coming years, given the broader market’s slow embrace of products based on alternative benchmarks. Many say the change is comparable in scope to the adoption of the Dodd-Frank reforms following the 2008 financial crisis, while others liken the situation to Y2K, which presented significant operational challenges to Wall Street even if it ultimately proved benign.Manske, who is a member of the New York Fed’s Alternative Reference Rates Committee designed to smooth the shift to SOFR (pronounced ‘So-fur’), compares the transition’s impact on financial markets to the adoption of the euro two decades ago.“The euro was dealing with a spot FX rate, forwards and options markets,” Manske said. “This is cross-border, secured versus unsecured, credit spread versus no credit spread, cash and derivatives markets. It’s definitely more complicated than most things the market has done.”For Goldman Sachs’s Granet, who grew up doing jigsaws, it’s one of the largest, most challenging puzzles he’s ever faced. Along with his four-person team and a dedicated group of lawyers, he’s been focusing in recent months on reviewing portfolio exposure, rewriting contracts and retooling trading systems to incorporate Libor’s anticipated replacements.The scale of the task means “literally every part of the firm is involved,” Granet said. “Taking a step back, it’s a pretty foundational change to a lot of things that are going on now” in global finance.Bloomberg.com"

One rate cut by December is fully priced, as is one more cut by June next year. That may not be quick enough, especially with the country’s yield curve inverting to the point that historically has presaged central bank easing, Doyle said.“In the event that we are heading into a global recession and things turn ugly and you get rising unemployment rates globally, then Canada is going to have to ease, maybe even more than the U.S.,” Doyle said in a telephone interview.Macquarie is assigning a more than 50 per cent chance of a cut in September, plus another cut in October.Scotiabank also revised its rate outlook last Friday, predicting one rate cut this year from the Bank of Canada no later than at its Oct. 30 decision, and as early as Sept. 4. A second cut would come early in 2020. It based the revision on the view the U.S.-China trade war will persist through Donald Trump’s presidency.“Risks to the Canadian economy are on the rise,” Jean-François Perrault, Scotiabank’s chief economist, said in a note to clients. “Dependent as it is on international trade, Canada cannot be immune to the rising tide of protectionism.”Perrault is more sanguine about the domestic outlook than Doyle. He believes Canadian economic conditions don’t warrant rate cuts, but the heightened global uncertainty requires a cautious tone.“We now believe the Bank of Canada will follow those that cut rates to insure against potential damage,” Perrault said.Economists and markets have been expecting fewer moves, and a slower pace of cutting from Canada, for a number of reasons. The nation’s economy probably grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms, unlike the U.S., and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank’s target.Risks to the Canadian economy are on the riseBut historically it’s also rare for Canada to be so out of sync with the Fed, which has already cut its policy rate once and is seen moving again three more times over the next six months.As of Aug. 16, implied odds based on cash forward rates show investors are pricing in 37 basis points of easing over the next six months for the Bank of Canada, versus 81 points for the Fed. The discrepancy in expectations for Canadian and U.S. policy moves has been averaging the widest since 2010.Regardless, Doyle expects the domestic economic data to make a turn for the worse in the next few months. Inflation pressures are likely to moderate, particularly as mortgage costs fall, business investment looks uncertain, and inventories have built up to recession-era levels, all of which point to a softer second half for the Canadian economy, Doyle said in a recent research report.Bloomberg.com"

His comments come as industry groups push federal officials to revisit lending rules that were introduced last year, contributing to a rapidly cooling market and making it harder for first-time buyers to purchase homes. Some argue the country’s banking regulator should ease up on stress tests requiring homebuyers to show they can handle payments 200 basis points higher than the contracted rate.“It’s taken a number of buyers out of the market temporarily as they build a greater down payment for that mortgage, it’s cooled housing prices, but it’s all about balancing supply demand and, like every policy, it’s not static,” said McKay, whose company is Canada’s largest mortgage lender. “Maybe you have to re-look at parts of it and tweak it.”Also in the interview, McKay said he sees a fairly low chance of significant interest-rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to make one of its own. Canada’s currency should remain in the range of 76.92 US cents, a level at which the country would remain competitive, he said.“If the U.S. starts cutting, and the rate differential starts closing, we’ll see pressure on a strengthening Canadian dollar,” McKay said. “But that’s offset by slower oil, gas sales, slower export sales. So it’s going to be a nominal pressure at the end of the day.” Bloomberg.com"

Curtis Stange, president and CEO of ATB, said the government needs to look at what’s happening across Canada  – and beyond the provinces with higher-growth housing markets.  “We believe the federal government and regulators still need to listen Canadians broadly and continue to look especially at the component of the 200-basis point stress test,” Stange told BNN Bloomberg’s Greg Bonnell Thursday. “There’s no doubt that the increase in interest rates, on top of the 200-basis point stress test, are making it difficult for some Canadians who would normally be able to get into a home, [to purchase] a home.” Stange joins a number of realtors and home-builder groups who have urged the government to revisit the B-20 rules in recent months. Economists from Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Canada also warned that the policy may be too severe and lead to unintended consequences in the real estate market. Meanwhile, Alberta’s housing industry is still feeling the effects stemming from the oil price collapse in 2014 and housing conditions have evolved overall across Canada since the new mortgage rules were first introduced, Stange added. “The conditions simply have changed,” he said. “Let’s look at the conditions as they change and look at the potential of reducing the size of that stress test … perhaps to something a little bit smaller.”"

New listings fell 0.4 per cent to 15,816, leading to increased competition between buyers and price increases across certain segments.Benchmark prices, which adjusts for the type of housing sold, rose 3.6 per cent to $798,500 from a year ago, driven by gains in semi-detached homes, townhouses and condos.The average price of a home increased 3 per cent from last June to $832,703. While sales of detached homes surged 19 per cent from last year, they were the only segment to see prices drop on an average basis, falling 1.4 per cent.Toronto home sales have bounced back in recent months after slumping amid tighter mortgage-lending rules and higher interest rates in the past year. Despite the rebound, the housing board continues to ask policy makers to provide more flexibility on mortgage qualifications and to take measures to boost supply.“Buyers started moving off the sidelines in the spring,” Jason Mercer, TREB’s chief market analyst, said in a statement. “However, because we saw virtually no change in the number of new listings, market conditions tightened and price growth picked up, especially for more higher density home types, which, on average, are less-expensive than traditional detached houses and therefore provide more affordable housing options.”Condos were the only segment to see a sales drop, falling 3.2 per cent from the same period last year. The decline was largely driven by sales in the core of the city, which saw sales fall 5.6 per cent compared to a gain of 2.7 per cent in the greater Toronto region. Still, condo prices continued to rise overall, with the benchmark price up 7.5 per cent in June to $539,500 from the same month a year ago.The number of condos leased jumped 15 per cent in the second quarter to 9,749 from the same period last year, as listings grew by 29 per cent.Rents continued to rise but at a slower pace. A one-bedroom condo in the Toronto region rented for an average $2,192 in the second quarter, 6.7 per cent higher than last year but only slightly higher than $2,143 in the first quarter. Rent on a two-bedroom condo rose 4.3 per cent to $2,873.“Renters do appear to be benefiting from more supply in the marketplace,” Mercer said. But he added rents are still growing well above the rate of inflation, suggesting even more supply is required to keep up with population growth and new household formation.Bloomberg.com"

The average price of a condo was up 3.6 per cent to $579,000 in the same period, the slowest rate of increase since 2015.“Condo prices are still being propped up by factors like high immigration, a strong job market, rising income, low borrowing costs, but we see demand starting to take a hit due to high prices, following a 45 per cent run-up over the past three years,” Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, said in a phone interview.Hildebrand sees price growth capped at 6 per cent for the foreseeable future due to a wave of supply. A record 71,378 condo units were under construction in the first quarter, according to Urbanation.The Toronto housing market took a hit last year after the government tightened mortgage-lending rules to ease rising debt and soaring home prices in the region. That pushed a lot of buyers into the cheaper condo segment, which saw prices jump as much as 11 per cent in the first quarter of last year.“The stress test is creating affordability challenges for first-time buyers plus single-family home prices haven’t become more competitive and growth for larger suites is also starting to slow down,” Hildebrand said. Price growth for smaller units is still well above average while growth for larger ones has fallen below average.The average price of a three-bedroom condo reached $800,000 in Toronto in the first quarter, higher than the combined average price of $727,000 for semi-attached, row and townhouses in May. In contrast, prices averaged below $500,000 in the first quarter for studios and one-bedroom units.Rent gains for Toronto condos have also been easing in the past few quarters and are expected to continue cooling amid a surge in completions of condo and purpose-built rental apartments, Hildebrand said.Bloomberg.com"

In Canada, you can’t really say that.”Here are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada — and one that shows why the country’s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada’s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. “That’s about as low as it gets, historically,” said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn’t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.“If there were to be a recession, whether it’s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,” Lascelles said in a separate webcast. “They just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.”Canada’s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada’s households are “substantially more leveraged” than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.In Canada, the debt service ratio — the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt — climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. “It’s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,” Lascelles said. “That’s a concern.”Because the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.“It doesn’t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,” Lascelles said. “The vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It’s not whether you have a lot of debt, it’s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada’s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.”If the housing market implodes — which Lascelles isn’t expecting — it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. “And so to the extent we haven’t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren’t as many households that are vulnerable.”He added: “It’s not obvious there’s a debt crisis in the making though. It’s just one that’s going to limit consumer spending and limit the economy more generally.”Bloomberg.com"

While a substantial jump, sales are picking up from a 15-year low last May, and are still below the 10-year average of about 10,300 for the month.May sales were the highest on a seasonally adjusted basis since December 2017, just before new stress tests came into place. The market took a deep dive after the government tightened mortgage lending rules in January 2018. While 2019 got off to a ‘sluggish’ start, sales picked up in the second quarter and the market continues to stabilize, according to the report.Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, rose 3.1 per cent in May from last year to $794,800. The average price of a home grew by 3.6 per cent to $838,540, largely driven by the condo and townhouse segments.“We are experiencing annual rates of price growth that are largely sustainable right now in the GTA — above the rate of inflation, but in single digits,” Jason Mercer, the board’s chief market analyst, said. “If, however, we continue to see growth in sales outstrip growth in new listings, price growth will accelerate.”While condo price gains are leading the pack, they slowed to an increase of 4.9 per cent for the month. New listings for all homes rose 0.8 per cent in May from last year to 19,386.Bloomberg.com"

The reason that TD and RBC in particular went south was to find greener fields.”Much of Canada is experiencing a housing slowdown and household debt is at record high, crimping further borrowing. The country also is a mature market for banking, with lenders getting much of their growth by stealing market share from each other. Canada’s economic prospects are forecast to lag behind those of its southern neighbour. Gross domestic product in Canada is expected to grow 1.5 per cent this year, compared with 2.6 per cent for the U.S.That bodes well for Canadian banks with operations abroad — and less so for those relying on domestic businesses to fuel growth. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal, lenders with significant operations outside the country, report their results next week.Earnings at Canadian banks’ domestic personal and commercial divisions were expected to rise 5.2 per cent on average from a year earlier, less than the 14.3 per cent increase forecast for their U.S. and international consumer-lending units, RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic said in a note to clients earlier this month.At Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which gets a greater share of profits from domestic consumer banking than its peers, earnings from its personal and small business banking division fell 2.4 per cent to $570 million. CIBC’s biggest profit gains, meanwhile, came from U.S. commercial banking and wealth management, with 18 per cent growth. Canadian mortgages declined, home-equity credit lines were little changed and loan-loss provisions rose from a year ago.At Royal Bank, earnings rose 2.4 per cent in the company’s Canadian division, its smallest year-over-year growth in five quarters, and far smaller than the 17 per cent jump in RBC Capital Markets earnings and 8.9 per cent surge in wealth management, which includes earnings from Los Angeles-based City National Bank.Even Toronto-Dominion, with retail-banking operations on both sides of the border, saw a greater boost from the U.S. than from Canada. Earnings from Canadian retail, which includes wealth management, rose just 0.9 per cent, while the bank’s U.S. retail division, including the TD Ameritrade discount brokerage, soared 29 per cent. With a network that stretches from Maine to Florida, Toronto-Dominion has more bank branches in the U.S. than in Canada.Canadian consumer banking still represents the biggest share of profits at the country’s financial companies, representing almost half of earnings on average for the big banks.Scotiabank — Canada’s most international bank, with operations in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia — reports earnings on May 28, and Bank of Montreal, whose non-domestic operations include Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, follows the next day. Scotiabank analyst Sumit Malhotra has predicted that Toronto-based Bank of Montreal will see its biggest earnings growth from U.S. personal and commercial banking.Bloomberg.com"
122,"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg,How much do we owe against our homes? Not even the Bank of Canada knows for sure,It's one of the biggest questions hanging over Canada's record household debt,0,,0,,2019-05-09,https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/as-helocs-morph-the-bank-of-canada-asks-lenders-for-details,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/helocs.jpg,"One of the biggest questions hanging over Canada’s record household debt is just how much borrowers owe against their homes.Officials have warned about the dangers of Helocs — home equity lines of credit — and the potential risks to Canada’s financial system. Yet for those seeking to quantify those risks, obtaining a precise figure for Canadian Heloc debt can be tricky.Regulators agree. That’s why this month the Bank of Canada will begin collecting more detailed data on Helocs to bolster its analysis of financial-system threats. The central bank has been working informally with lenders on the reporting, which becomes a formal requirement as of May 15.Helocs can add to debt burdens because they don’t typically have a fixed repayment schedule. If home prices fall, borrowers can find themselves with more debt than their properties are worth, the dreaded “negative equity” scenario that played a significant role in the U.S. housing crash a decade ago. The issue has come into focus as Canada’s ratio of debt to disposable income reached a record 174 per cent in the fourth quarter.“Given the flexibility Helocs can provide, borrowers can use them even in a downturn or if they lost their jobs to sustain household spending and continue to service their other debt,” Robert Colangelo at credit rating company DBRS Ltd. said in a phone interview. “It makes it difficult for lenders to identify emerging credit problems.”One obstacle to getting a clear picture is that Helocs themselves are evolving.Traditional Helocs are essentially revolving lines of credit that allow homeowners to borrow up to 65 per cent of their home’s value. The interest rate is usually tied to the prime lending rate, and only the interest on the loan needs to be paid each month. To qualify for a Heloc, the borrower must have at least 20 per cent home equity.Newer products combine a Heloc with a mortgage. These allow borrowers to tap as much as 80 per cent of the home’s value. A maximum of 65 per cent can be withdrawn on a revolving basis — the Heloc portion — while a minimum of 15 per cent must be amortizing, meaning regular payments of principal and interest, similar to a mortgage.Growth in stand-alone Helocs has been flat, while all of the banks are seeing strong growth in the hybrid product, which is relatively less risky because it’s partly amortizing, according to Himanshu Bakshi, credit research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. However, these hybrid Helocs are more complex than traditional ones, he said.Here’s what we do know.Canada’s six biggest banks reported $223 billion of outstanding, or drawn, Helocs as of Jan. 31. That accounted for about a tenth of the country’s $2.17 trillion total household debt.But the banks don’t disclose Heloc balances in the same way. The following was reported in regulatory filings or confirmed by representatives of the banks:• Toronto-Dominion Bank reported $87 billion of Helocs. However, it said 60 per cent of that, or $52.2 billion, was the amortizing portion of its blended Heloc-mortgage product, with the remaining $34.8 billion non-amortizing. • Royal Bank of Canada reported $39.6 billion of non-amortizing Helocs. A spokeswoman said the bank’s amortizing home equity product is classified as a mortgage. The bank said in a filing that ‘home equity lines of credit include term loans collateralized by residential mortgages. • Similarly, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce doesn’t disclose the breakdown of amortizing versus non-amortizing balances for its hybrid product. It reported $21.8 billion in non-amortizing Helocs. • Bank of Nova Scotia reported $20.8 billion in Helocs, which only includes non-amortizing balances. Amortizing balances are reported under residential mortgages. • Bank of Montreal reports similarly to Toronto-Dominion. A spokesman said 55 per cent, or $17.4 billion of its $31.7 billion in Helocs was amortizing, while the rest, $14.3 billion, was non-amortizing. • National Bank of Canada reported $22.2 billion of Helocs, half of which are amortizing and the other half non-amortizing, according to a spokesman.One of the major concerns about non-amortizing Helocs is the possibility for borrowers to pay only the monthly interest due on the loan. A recent government report found about a quarter of Heloc borrowers routinely make interest-only payments.However, some lenders put that figure much lower. Toronto-Dominion said less than 14 per cent of its Heloc customers made interest-only payments in the past year. RBC said 7 per cent of clients for its Homeline Heloc product make only the scheduled interest payment. None of the other banks disclose that figure.According to a document on the website of Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the central bank will require a more detailed breakdown of Helocs, as well as the utilization rate, or the share of drawn amounts versus approved amounts.The Heloc data will feed into the central bank’s analysis of financial system vulnerabilities and risks, spokeswoman Louise Egan said in an email. In efforts to balance transparency, confidentiality and quality, “data identifying an individual institution will not be published,” she said.Toronto-Dominion Bank and Scotiabank declined to comment on the new reporting requirements, while CIBC, BMO and National Bank didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. A Royal Bank representative said only the bank would comply with the regulations.With assistance from Paul Gulberg, Himanshu Bakshi and Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com"

A similar unit in the same building priced US$69,000 cheaper ended up selling way over asking.Whether it’s an apartment in a glitzy new skyscraper or a mansion in exclusive Forest Hill, pricing has become paramount as Canada’s biggest city heads into the busy spring property season. As the market stabilizes after a year of plunging sales, condo sales are a mixed bag and big detached homes are hard to shift.“The right product, in the right location, at the right price will get lots of interest and likely multiple offers,” said real estate agent Justin Wu, who’s handling the condo that’s still on the market. “Others take more work to sell.”Home sales in the Toronto region have dropped 37 per cent from their peak in 2016 while prices are down 4.4 per cent since maxing out at $815,200 in May of 2017. Re-sale condo listings swelled about 10 per cent in the first quarter from the same period last year, according to research firm Urbanation Inc.Canada’s federal housing agency lowered its assessment of the overall vulnerabilities in the national market to “moderate,” from “high,” according to a report Thursday.While there remains a “high degree of vulnerability” in Toronto and Vancouver, prices are moving closer to levels supported by fundamentals.Housing across the country has been adjusting amid tighter mortgage regulations, taxes on foreign buyers and other measures designed to curb runaway prices and household debt, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. While Vancouver’s market is still sinking, an influx of about 100,000 immigrants a year is providing an underpinning in Toronto, especially for condos.“The price differential between the average price of a condo apartment and a low-rise home has narrowed to its lowest level in four years, which is creating more supply competition for condos and sparking some move-up buying,” Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, said.For first-time buyer Adam De Biasi getting into the condo market was a totally nerve-wracking experience.“Every delay I had, another condo would slip through my fingers,” the 24-year-old engineer-in-training said in a phone interview. He felt if he didn’t get into the market he’d be living in a “shoebox” by the time he was ready to move out of his parents’ home.After months of searching — and losing out — he finally landed a one-bedroom in a presale project launched by Menkes Development Corp. north of Toronto that met his his budget of about $400,000. It’s right by the subway line and close to the highway.He got lucky, said Simeon Papailias, De Biasi’s agent. The sales office was “mayhem” as buyers and agents begged for units in that pricing sweet spot. That same week, Papailias went to another presale condo launch by CentreCourt Inc. and SmartREIT, which sold out in three days. He had to weave through almost 3,000 agents competing for 490 units.“The minute anything launches — $800 per square foot — and connects to Toronto by subway, there is a complete frenzy,” he said.Single-family homes are a different story. Prices across the city were up just half a per cent in March from a year ago compared, with a 7.2 per cent rise in condo prices.“There is a big challenge with low-rise, which is still suffering a lot. Even resales in established areas, it is a bit slower — I think it’s going to change but right now it is a bit slower,” Mark Mandelbaum, chairman of Lanterra Developments, said. “With a condo, if you don’t like it, you can rent it. It’s very hard to rent a house in Markham.”Again, pricing is key.Mattamy Homes, the biggest private residential homebuilder in North America, has seen hot demand for most of its single-home property launches, according to its founder, Peter Gilgan. “Every one of those launches, priced properly, is sold out after one day or two,” he said in a February interview. Many of the projects are outside the Toronto core.Great Gulf Group also launched a Whitby, Ontario project this month, which had steady lineups outside its sales centre and sold out, according to spokeswoman Madeline Zito.As for Wu, the agent who’s still waiting for takers on his unit in the city’s east end, it simply means having to put more work in. “This is very different from a couple years ago, when it was pretty indiscriminate” buying across the board, he said.Bloomberg.com"

That translates into about a 7 per cent decline in sales, they said.There is also evidence of a shift in business to private lenders who are not subject to the rules, known as B-20 and implemented by Canada’s banking regulator. The economists estimate the share of borrowers in Toronto accessing funds from alternative lenders increased to 8.7 per cent in the second quarter 2018, from 5.9 per cent in the same quarter a year earlier.The changes mean federally regulated lenders must now run a 200 basis-point stress test on new mortgages, to ensure the quality of lending remains high amid escalating home prices. The measures are disproportionately affecting first-time homebuyers, who normally account for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the market, as well as cities that have more youthful demographics like Toronto and Vancouver, TD said.“Right now it’s a one-size-fits all type of policy, and borrowers differ in their ability to service their mortgage, and they’re different in terms of their risks,” Bushmeneva said in a phone interview. She said policy makers could consider being flexible around the 200 basis point stress test limit, given it’s “somewhat arbitrary,” and doesn’t take into account the credit-worthiness of borrowers or their life stage.Immediately removing the rules would increase Canadian home prices an additional 6 per cent, on top of Toronto-Dominion’s current forecast for a 4 per cent increase, by the end of 2020, the economists wrote, adding that would boost home prices by about $32,000 (US$24,000) on average.The rules have pushed potential buyers into the rental market, leading vacancy rates for purpose-built rental units to fall by as much as 30 basis points in Toronto and Vancouver. That poses a “significant challenge” as those markets are already “severely under-supplied,” with current vacancy rates at just 1 per cent, the economists wrote.Toronto-Dominion joins fellow-lender Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, along with realtors and builder groups in calls for the government to revisit its B-20 rules.According to the note, Toronto-Dominion also forecasts:Housing starts to trend lower through 2020, as B-20 crimps market for new housing.New housing construction will be a drag on growth next year, though healthy job gains and robust population growth will provide a floor.Currently bank sees Canadian home prices stabilizing by mid-year and rising 4 per cent by end of 2020. However, if B-20 was immediately removed, nationwide sales and prices could be about 8 per cent and 6 per cent higher by end of 2020, equating to about $32,000 difference in average Canadian home price, with disproportionate impacts in Toronto, Vancouver.Removal of B-20 would represent a “significant near-term boost to housing activity, though at a longer-term cost of worsened affordability.”Bloomberg.com"

That resiliency could soon be tested if crude loses momentum.Many forecasters appear skeptical about the prospects for oil to advance much beyond its current level, potentially sapping some support from the loonie. West Texas Intermediate was at around US$63 per barrel on Monday and the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey is for it to end the year near that level.“We don’t see the same impetus coming from oil prices,” said Bipan Rai, the North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “So it begs the question about whether we can rely on incoming data to really drive some support for the loonie. That’s still pretty much a wild card.”The Canadian dollar has advanced 1.9 per cent this year against the U.S. currency, trailing only the British pound among its Group-of-10 peers. Oil has provided some buoyancy, but Canada’s domestic picture has been more cloudy. There is mounting concern about household indebtedness, home prices are dropping and growth practically ground to a halt in the final part of 2018. A Bank of Canada survey released Monday that showed softening business sentiment dented the loonie, dragging it down around 0.4 per cent on the day.While growth numbers for January were more upbeat and unemployment remains close to multi-decade lows, the central bank has become more circumspect. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz this month suggested that he is settling into a holding pattern on interest-rate policy. The global slowdown, coupled with a housing sector that is taking longer to adjust to tighter mortgage rules and higher rates, means the economy still needs the help of low borrowing costs, the BOC boss said.“Canada’s got to worry about an additional factor that the U.S. doesn’t at this point, and that is the fact that our household sector is extremely leveraged,” said Rai, who is based in Toronto. “It could prove to be a much more prolonged slowdown given that you may see households deleveraging.”He sees the loonie weakening to around $1.36 per greenback by the end of this year and $1.40 in 2020. It was at $1.3377 on Monday.Toronto-Dominion Bank also sees the Canadian currency coming under pressure, with currency strategist Mazen Issa pointing not only to risks from household debt but also potential spillover effects from international trade fights.“We’re basically looking at a situation that is very difficult to find any positives for the Canadian dollar overall,” said Issa. “In fact, it’s probably going to continue to get worse.”Not all observers are so pessimistic though. Bank of Montreal’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy, Greg Anderson, expects the loonie to rally to $1.30 per dollar by year end, while Scotiabank forecasts it will go to to $1.27.Eric Theoret at Scotiabank sees a weak greenback environment fuelling commodity-price gains and boosting Canada’s terms of trade, and says there’s room for improvement in the currency if crude prices continue to rise.“If oil prices keep moving the way they are, it should allow the Bank of Canada to withdraw some of the accommodation that they are currently providing,” said Theoret.Even if oil recovers, RBC Wealth Management expects the Canadian dollar to trade around its current levels until mid-year, with some modest softness taking it to a range of $1.34 to $1.36 per dollar by year end. Laura Cooper, head of FX solutions and strategy at RBC Wealth, sees limited scope for oil to bolster the loonie because pipeline constraints are helping to maintain a price gap between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark price. She’s also doubtful of any major shift from rate differentials, since both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are signaling extended tightening-cycle pauses.“In the absence of a catalyst coming from rate dynamics or commodity prices, we see the currency trading broadly sideways in coming months,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Those measures don’t come into effect until fall of this year, meaning some Canadians might hold off jumping into real estate until they can take advantage.The delayed purchases might further dent an already weakened housing market. Home sales across the country have been dismal in recent months, falling 9.1 per cent in February to the lowest level since 2012, and the slowdown is widespread across Canadian cities.“First-time home buyer activity is poised to slow down between now and September 2019, as many house-hunting millennials await more details and crunch their numbers.” Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note Wednesday. “This could depress the market even further during that period.”The new measures may also make it tough for the Bank of Canada to get a proper read on the housing sector. Policy makers there have noted the difficulty of disentangling the effects of federal mortgage regulations and higher interest rates on the real estate market.But even if sales are damped throughout the spring and summer selling season, Hogue expects a rebound just prior to the federal election, when Canadians begin to access the new measures, which will be administered by the federal housing agency.“Any delayed purchases will fuel stronger activity in the fall,” Hogue said.Bloomberg.com"

The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.“This is an election budget, it’s safe to say,” Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country’s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder’s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. “We should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,” Hyder said.The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation’s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday’s budget, Morneau’s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.Despite that windfall, there’s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.“We expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,” Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight “skills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you’re currently in it.”That could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. “We’re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year’s budget,” said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been “very beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.”On housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure “millennials can see some optimism for them and their families,” suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.“We’ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it’s stable,” Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. “What we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.”The budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government’s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau’s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.Morneau has also said the government will “make sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism” and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded “pharmacare” program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party’s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he’s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada’s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, climbed 0.8 per cent from the prior month to $767,800.The decline in transactions so far this year extends 2018’s losses which were the worst in a decade, leading to speculation policy makers went too far when they added stress tests to mortgage-lending requirements. The regulator that imposed the rules —the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions — should review them, and amortization periods for federally insured mortgages should be extended to 30 years to give buyers a break, the real estate board said.“The OSFI mandated mortgage stress test has left some buyers on the sidelines who have struggled to qualify for the type of home they want to buy,” Gurcharan Bhaura, TREB’s president, said in a statement. “There is a federal budget and election on the horizon. It will be interesting to see what policy measures are announced to help with home ownership affordability.”Meanwhile, new listings also declined, falling 6.2 per cent from a year earlier to 9,828. The fact new listings fell more than sales suggests conditions became tighter over the past year, supporting price growth, the board said. Average home prices rose 1.6 per cent from a year earlier to $780,397.The semi-detached segment was the best performer, with average prices rising 9.9 per cent to $832,569 on the year. Condo prices jumped 6.1 per cent to $562,161. Detached homes declined 2.1 per cent to $980, 914.The realtor board warned of the potential consequences of any further declines, saying the substantial drop in sales compared with the 2016 peak has translated into a “hit to the economy” in the billions of dollars.“This hit has also translated into lower government revenues and, if sustained, could impact the employment picture as well,” Jason Mercer, the board’s director of market analysis, said in the statement.With assistance from Natalie WongBloomberg.com"

The same’s true for his household finances.The billionaire recently took out US$61 million in mortgages on five properties in California, four in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles and one in Hillsborough, in the Bay Area. The Morgan Stanley loans, signed in the final days of 2018, represent about US$50 million in new borrowing. One refinancing on a 20,200-plus square-foot property he bought in 2012 for US$17 million turned a US$10 million loan into a US$19.5 million debt.His monthly payment: about $180,000.The loans show how even the wealthiest people use mortgages to maintain liquidity. Musk, with a US$23.4 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is among ultra-wealthy property owners including Mark Zuckerberg, Ken Griffin, and Beyonce and Jay-Z who have taken out monster mortgages. Citadel founder Griffin stands out, with two secured in 2016 for a total of about US$114 million.Representatives for Musk at Tesla didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Susan Siering, a spokeswoman at Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.Huge mortgages like Musk’s are lending-world unicorns. Across most of the U.S., a loan falls into the jumbo category (also called non-conforming) once it exceeds US$484,350. The definition of a super jumbo isn’t as clear, but for a wealth-management operation catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients they might start in the US$2 million to US$2.5 million range.“Once you get above probably US$10 million, I’d describe it as ‘by appointment,”‘ said Michael Blum, group managing director and head of the banking group at UBS Wealth Management USA. At that level, the number of loans “thins quite a bit,” he said.More than 230 single-family mortgages of US$10 million to US$20 million were outstanding in 2018, with 75 per cent taken out since 2013, a CoreLogic analysis of U.S. public data found. More than half were secured by homes in California, said Frank Nothaft, CoreLogic’s chief economist. About 180 were refinancings.Over the years, Musk has used his shares in Tesla Inc. to obtain personal loans. About 40 per cent of his stake in the electric carmaker was pledged at the end of 2017, according to a regulatory filing. Musk also inquired with at least one bank last year about a personal loan tied to his stake in rocket company SpaceX, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Musk, 47, doesn’t take a salary from Tesla, and he’s repeatedly gone to the market to buy the carmaker’s stock in a show of confidence in the company, which has never turned an annual profit. He recently put one of his Los Angeles-area homes on the market for US$4.5 million.He’s played down the extent to which wealth motivates him, tweeting in October that he had “very little time for recreation” and saying that he didn’t have “vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.”The entrepreneur has a wide web of dealings with Morgan Stanley, whose private bank was the lender on his recent mortgages. When Musk pledged Tesla shares at the end of 2017, 55 per cent were with the lender. Morgan Stanley, which has a US$2.3 trillion wealth-management unit, has tripled loans to high-net-worth individuals in the past five years.Musk has also been a client of the firm’s investment bank, hiring it and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year when he considered taking Tesla private. Both were lead underwriters on stock and convertible-debt offerings for the company.As home prices continue to rise in high-cost areas, more properties will fall into the super-jumbo loan category, CoreLogic’s Nothaft said. Many will be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, with initial fixed-rate terms of five years, meaning refinancing volume is likely to increase as short-term rates rise.Musk’s loans are for 30 years with a fixed 3.5 per cent interest rate for the first few years and then adjust based on an index.Providing mega-mortgages helps bank profit margins in the short run, and is highly strategic long-term.“To get a new relationship on the investment side with a new high-net-worth client is very difficult,” said Gauthier Vincent, lead wealth management consulting partner for Deloitte. “On the credit side, it’s a much easier way to get in, if you’re really good at it, than to try and compete on the investments.”Bespoke lending also makes clients “stickier,” said Brent Beardsley, who leads Boston Consulting Group’s work in asset and wealth management globally. If a client has a difficult-to-value loan, it’s harder for them to leave for a rival. Depending on the source of their wealth, loans can lead a banker into a client’s business finances, which may be commingled with personal assets, Beardsley said.Why do the ultra-wealthy even need to take out loans? Some, like Musk, are asset-rich but relatively cash-poor. Lending activity picks up as tax time approaches, with clients either fully invested or not as liquid as they need to be to make a tax payment, UBS’s Blum said.“We try to educate clients that what you probably don’t want to do is sell stocks or bonds and create yet another tax liability by selling so you can pay your taxes this year,” Blum said.Ultra-wealthy investors may also find mortgage interest a relatively small price to pay for liquidity. “With rates still historically low, it’s still a very attractive alternative,” Blum said. “Clients would just rather not tie up all the liquidity in a purchase of a very expensive property.”Lending to the wealthy extends beyond mortgages. The most bread-and-butter type of asset-based borrowing is securities-based lending on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Other assets that can be borrowed against include art, yachts, pre-IPO shares and hedge-fund stakes. Hedge funds and the general partners in private-equity funds may take out so-called partner loans in order to invest in a new fund without tapping their own liquidity, said Deloitte’s Vincent.Then there are the truly rarefied loans. Vincent recalls one situation with a Middle Eastern client from the days when he was a private banker. The client wanted to buy a Boeing 747 “and redo the inside so his family could fly from the Middle East to London to Paris to do their shopping on the weekend,” Vincent said.–With assistance from Dana Hull.Bloomberg.com"
18,Bloomberg News,Paula Sambo,Housing slump in Canada prompts calls to loosen mortgage rules,"Federal officials should revisit lending rules that were introduced last year, as the housing market rapidly cools and first-time buyers find it increasingly difficult to buy a home, industry groups say.",-1,,-1,,2019-02-05,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/housing-slump-in-canada-prompts-calls-to-loosen-mortgage-rules-1.1209481,,"Federal officials should revisit lending rules that were introduced last year, as the housing market rapidly cools and first-time buyers find it increasingly difficult to buy a home, industry groups say. Paul Taylor, chief executive officer of Mortgage Professionals Canada, said the country’s banking regulator should ease up on stress tests that require homebuyers to prove they can handle payments at 200 basis points above the contracted rate. He’s also urging the government to extend amortization periods back to 30 years for first-time buyers. “If we continue to force those folks to rent, they’re going to see continuing escalating costs and the average Canadian is going to be a whole lot worse off in a decade,” Taylor said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. His group’s 11,500 brokerages, lenders, and insurers originate more than 35 per cent of all mortgages in Canada and 55 percent for first-time buyers, according to its website. Taylor is urging the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the country’s banking regulator, to adjust the rate for stress tests to 75 basis points. A string of government rule changes over the past several years is generating a widening backlash as Canada’s housing market continues to soften. Toronto and Vancouver, the country’s two most-expensive markets, are coming off their worst year for sales in at least a decade. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES Since mid-2017, the Bank of Canada has lifted its key lending rate five times, to 1.75 per cent. David Wilkes, chief executive officer at the Building Industry and Land Development Association, says the stress test needs to be changed to reflect those higher borrowing costs. Wilkes also says one of the unintended consequences of the rule changes is that they’re driving home buyers into secondary markets where rates are often much higher. “Without those changes, we are going to continue to see a dampening of demand,” Wilkes said in a telephone interview. The federal government has the opportunity in its upcoming budget to make changes, such as extending amortization periods, Wilkes said. It could also use “moral suasion” to encourage lenders to look at longer mortgage terms, so rather than the standard 5-year term, they could offer 7-year or 10-year terms, similar to what’s available in other markets, Wilkes said. Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who’s preparing his budget ahead of an election in October, said this month the government is looking at ways to make homes more affordable for younger buyers. Carolyn Rogers, Osfi deputy superintendent, is due to speak Tuesday in Toronto about the stress tests. “I’m hopeful that there’ll be some sort of a reduction to the stress test,"" Taylor said. ""But I’m also nervous that they will create some sort of overly complex tax rebate system specifically for first time buyers that won’t assist them at all.”"

Carolyn Rogers, the No. 2 at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said the tougher mortgage lending rules remain a prudent way to guard against risks in the the marketplace. Still, the regulator is continually assessing conditions. “OSFI monitors the environment on a continual basis and when we determine that adjustments to our standards and guidelines are warranted, we make them,” Rogers said in a speech Tuesday in Toronto. The country’s banking regulator has been facing pressure in particular to ease up on stress tests that require home buyers to prove they can handle payments at 200 basis points above the contracted rate. The rule came into effect in January 2018, triggering a sales slow down in the country’s two priciest markets — Toronto and Vancouver. Rogers said that while interest rates have increased since the measure was introduced, borrowing costs still remain historically low and personal debts remain high. There could also be changes to income or other home owning expenses that make it difficult to pay off mortgages. “It’s prudent to have a buffer for these changes as well,” she said. At the same time, the introduction of the stress tests themselves were an adjustment to a “shift in risks” in the financial system and things could change. “Should that margin of safety be monitored, and should changes be considered if conditions in the environment change? Of course they should,” she said."

Lower house prices and higher mortgage rates will not only dent consumer confidence, but also disposable incomes, S&P Global Ratings said in a report last month. A simultaneous decline in house prices globally could lead to “financial and macroeconomic instability,” the IMF said in study released in April.While each city in the region has its own distinct characteristics, there are a few common denominators: rising borrowing costs, increased government regulation and volatile stock markets. There’s also dwindling demand from a force so powerful it pushed prices to a record in many places — Chinese buyers.“As China’s economy is affected by the trade war, capital outflows have become more difficult, thus weakening demand in markets including Sydney and Hong Kong,” said Patrick Wong, a real estate analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.After an almost 15-year bull run that made Hong Kong notorious for having the world’s least affordable property market, home prices have taken a battering.Values in the city have fallen for 13 weeks straight since August, the longest losing streak since 2008, figures from Centaline Property Agency Ltd. show. Concerns about higher borrowing costs and a looming vacancy tax have contributed to the slide.The strike rate of mainland Chinese developers successfully bidding for residential sites is also waning, tumbling to 27 per cent in 2018 from 70 per cent in 2017, JLL’s Residential Sales Market Monitor released Thursday showed. Of the 11 residential sites tendered by authorities last year, only three were won by Chinese companies.“The change in attitude can be explained by a slowing mainland economy,” said Henry Mok, JLL’s senior director of capital markets. “Throw in a simmering trade war between China and the U.S., the government has taken actions to restrict capital outflows, which in turn has increased difficulties for developers to invest overseas.”Home prices on the island, which regularly ranks among the world’s most expensive places to live, posted their first drop in six quarters in the three months ended December. Luxury was hit the hardest, with values in prime areas sinking 1.5 per cent.Government policies are mainly to blame. Cooling measures implemented unexpectedly in July included higher stamp duties and tougher loan-to-value rules. Extra constraints since then have included curbs on the number of “shoe-box” apartments and anti-money laundering rules that imposed an additional administrative burden on developers.It’s all worked to put the brakes on a home-price recovery that only lasted for five quarters, the shortest since data became available.“Landed home prices, being bigger ticket items, have taken a greater beating as demand softened,” said Ong Teck Hui, a senior director of research and consultancy at JLL. (In Singapore, most people live in high-rise apartments, called housing development board flats. Landed homes by contrast occupy their own ground space.)Sydney-siders have begun to wonder — what sort of economic fallout will there be from the wealth destruction that comes with the worst slump in home values since the late 1980s?Average home values in the harbour city have fallen 11.1 per cent since their 2017 peak, according to CoreLogic Inc. data released Wednesday — surpassing the 9.6 per cent top-to-bottom decline when Australia was on the cusp of entering its last recession.While prices are still about 60 per cent higher than they were in 2012, meaning few existing homeowners are actually underwater, it’s economist forecasts of a further 10 per cent fall that’s making nervous investors think twice about extraneous spending.The central bank is also worried that a prolonged downturn will drag on consumption and with the main opposition Labor party pledging to curb tax perks for property investors if it wins an election expected in May, confidence is likely to be hit further.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday urged the nation’s banks not to tighten credit any more as the deepening downturn threatens to weigh on the economy.A crackdown on overheating prices has hampered sales and left values in the nation’s biggest cities around 5 per cent below their peak. Rules on multiple home purchases, or how soon a property can be sold once it’s bought, are starting to be relaxed, and there are giveaways galore as home builders try to lure buyers.One developer in September was giving away a BMW Series 3 or X1 to anyone wishing to purchase a three-bedroom unit or townhouse at its project in Shanghai. Down-payments have also been slashed, with China Evergrande Group asking for just 5 per cent compared with the usual 30 per cent deposit required.“It’s not a surprise to see Beijing and Shanghai residential prices fall given the curbing policies currently on these two markets,” said Henry Chin, head of research at CBRE Group Inc. An index that measures second-hand home prices in Beijing has been falling since September while one that tracks Shanghai has been on the decline now for almost 12 months, he said.Bloomberg.com"

They say November was their busiest on record, and December — typically a slow time of year in the insolvency trade — hasn’t let up.“I’m essentially trying to add capacity every day to get people seen,” Blair Mantin, a Vancouver-based licensed insolvency trustee at Sands & Associates, said by phone. “Usually things slow down around Christmas, but we haven’t seen the demand slow down this year.”The interviews, while anecdotal, add to recent indications rate hikes are beginning to take a toll, and suggest insolvencies may keep rising. The latest official data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies showed the rate of consumer insolvencies rose 9.4 per cent in October on an annual basis, the most since 2016.Insolvency data can be volatile, but it appears Canadian consumers are at an inflection point. “The tide has turned, and the water’s starting to rise,” Ted Michalos, a licensed insolvency trustee at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates Inc., said in a phone interview. “Now it’s just a question of how quickly does it rise.”The effects of higher borrowing costs are beginning to be felt broadly. Vehicle sales, among the sectors most sensitive to rising rates, fell the most since 2009, while growth in residential mortgages decelerated to the slowest pace since 1982, worrying signs for an economy so reliant on consumption.The tide has turned, and the water's starting to rise. Now it's just a question of how quickly does it riseIn addition, liabilities are eating up a bigger share of disposable income. Canada’s debt service ratio climbed to 14.51 on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, the highest since 2008, the federal statistics agency reported last week.Hoyes, Michalos — which usually accounts for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of insolvency filings in Ontario — just had its busiest November since opening in 1999. The insolvency trustee and debt relief agency received 1,000 new inquiries, compared with 650 in November 2017, and initiated 384 new filings, surpassing the previous high of 350 in November 2009. Through the first 10 days of December, Michalos said the firm’s numbers are up 57 per cent from a year earlier.Lower gasoline prices aren’t fully offsetting higher mortgage costs, and “there is very little room in many Canadians’ budgets to absorb these increased costs,” he said, adding he’s also seeing more clients with so-called installment loans, basically large, high-interest payday loans that can be paid off over a longer period.Mantin, whose Vancouver-based firm recorded it’s biggest year-over-year increase in filings in November since he joined eight years ago, also cited an increase in large payday loans among his clients. He said previously it would have been typical to see payday loans of $500 (US$373) or $1,000. Now he sometimes sees “installment loans” of $15,000.Higher rates are hitting at a time when consumers are already struggling to cope with the recent housing boom. Mantin says the majority of clients in the firm’s downtown Vancouver office pay 50 per cent or more of their income in rent, “and you can only do that for so long,” he said. Other clients are young families who overextended themselves at the peak of the boom, often tapping home equity to make renovations, and now can’t sell.Grant Bazian, president at MNP Ltd., said November was the agency’s busiest ever, with year-over-year growth in filings of about 12 per cent. For December, “it looks like the trend is holding up,” putting MNP on pace for a record fourth quarter, he said.“The biggest driver of the increased filings appears to be rising interest rates,” Bazian said by phone from Vancouver. “People just get in over their heads.”The Bank of Canada has raised rates five times since mid-2017, and Governor Stephen Poloz has said he’s watching the economy closely to gauge the effects. Investors are increasingly sure the bank will proceed more slowly, with implied odds showing one more increase over the next 12 months. In October, the expectation was for three more.David Lewis, an Edmonton-based board member at the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, which represents about 1,000 insolvency professionals, said higher borrowing costs are already having an impact.“Most of our membership believe that it’s not a blip, that we will see an uptick in numbers just because of the interest rates rising,” he said in a phone interview. “People are finding they can’t deal with the debt month to month, that they could have dealt with six or eight months ago because they’re paying extra interest on it all.”Bloomberg.com"

The market picked up pace through the summer, though sales have declined for the third month in a row now.The drop in sales could in part be attributed to a decline in new listings, which fell 26 per cent to 10,534 from last November.“New listings were actually down more than sales on a year-over-year basis in November,” Garry Bhaura, the president of the board, said in a statement. “This suggests that, in many neighbourhoods, competition between buyers may have increased. Relatively tight market conditions over the past few months have provided the foundation for renewed price growth.”Average home prices rose 3.5 per cent to $788,345 from last year, though sales were down 15 per cent over the same period.The semi-detached housing segment was the strongest performing sector with average prices rising 8.3 per cent to $791,760 on the year. Condo prices jumped 7.5 per cent to $556,723.Given the impact of new mortgage stress tests and higher borrowing costs, it makes sense that condos and the semi-detached market experienced relatively stronger rates of price growth in November, Jason Mercer, the board’s director of market analysis, said.Bloomberg.com"

Executives at Mattamy Homes Ltd., North America’s largest closely held home builder, said the rules have brought about the desired soft landing and aren’t needed as much now that interest rates are rising. The Canadian Home Builders’ Association said the rules are hitting millennials and struggling markets like Calgary particularly hard. The rules, put in place in January, require even those with a 20 per cent down payment, who don’t need mortgage insurance, to prove that they can make payments at 2 percentage points above the contracted rate. The so-called B-20 stress tests already existed for insured mortgages. By April, the average home price in Toronto had tumbled 12 per cent from the same month the prior year, though has since stabilized. “We’re going to continue to lobby for a pullback now on B-20,” Brad Carr, chief executive officer of Mattamy Homes Canada, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “That had a very targeted outcome. It’s been achieved so its kind of overkill now.” As rates rise “they’re doing their natural job and that 2 per cent spread, we certainly hope the government will either remove it or at least cap it,” Carr said. Peter Gilgan, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Mattamy Homes, added that a reduction to 1.5 per cent or 1 per cent would make sense. “Ideally at this point the best thing would be for the new stress test to be repealed, just removed,” David Foster, director of communications at the CHBA said. “Markets like Calgary, they’re already quite soft, are just hammered by this.” Foster said the restrictions are disproportionately affecting young first-time buyers and the longer the rules are in place the more disenfranchised that age cohort is going to be. The stress tests also perversely tend to push people into open variable rate mortgages or the non-regulated space, neither of which are without significant risk to the borrower, he said."

She’s up against 3,779 others, so the odds of winning are only about 50:1 but figures it’s as good a chance as any of finding a place to live.Long priced out of home ownership, Ross is now being squeezed out of the rental market as the country’s biggest population boom since 1957 sends prices surging in Canada’s biggest city.The 56-year-old unemployed office worker pays $1,026 (US$776) for her one-bedroom apartment. Her savings and unemployment insurance are running out and she’s been looking for a cheaper place but units that were in her price range only a few years ago have nearly doubled.“It’s so stressful and I suffer from heart palpitations and anxiety,” said Ross from her 24th-floor apartment where hanging plants and bright cushions create a refuge in a dingy building in constant combat with pest infestations.As U.S. President Donald Trump has clamped down on high-tech visas and amped up the anti-immigration rhetoric Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a more welcoming approach. Canada took in a record 413,000 people from abroad in the year through July 1, pushing population growth to 1.4 per cent, the fastest in the Group of Seven.Almost 100,000 of those immigrants have landed in Toronto in the past year, including refugee claimants, a surge in international students and workers chasing thousands of new high-tech jobs at companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Add in those who can’t meet stricter mortgage regulations after house prices jumped 60 per cent in the past five years and it’s been an all out war for rentals.“We’ve reached a point now where given the amount of people, industries we’re attracting, we are already becoming terribly unaffordable for everyone,” said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of several books on urban issues. “We’re at a crisis and we don’t even realize it: Our transit, traffic problem and housing problem are urgent matters.”Supply isn’t beginning to keep up. Condo completions have been running near a five-year low of about 10,000 units, according to Altus Group Ltd. And only about 60 purpose-built rental buildings have been constructed since 2005, bringing a meager 11,620 units to market when the city’s been creating about 17,000 renter households a year, according to property research firm Urbanation Inc.The result has been skyrocketing prices. Condo rents soared 7.6 per cent to an average $2,385 in the third quarter over the same period a year ago and were up 17 per cent for newly available purpose-built units, according to data from Urbanation. Meanwhile, the apartment vacancy rate sits at about 0.5 per cent.Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,That might still be a bargain compared with cities like San Francisco, where a one-bedroom went for US$3,333 in 2017 or New York where it cost US$2,811, though prices in those cities have stabilized over the past year.Those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder are getting hit the hardest.“Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,” said Alejandra Ruiz Vargas, a member at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now Canada, which represents low and moderate-income families.With asylum claims to Canada also doubling in the past year, it’s getting harder for refugees to find housing too, said Lucy Chaimiti, executive director at Adam House, a refugee support group. It usually takes people four to six months to find housing after arriving in the city and they usually end up spending about 85 per cent of their social assistance income on housing, she said.City and provincial policymakers are beginning to wake up to the brewing affordability crisis. In an election dominated by housing last month, Mayor John Tory pledged to bring 40,000 affordable rental units to the city over the next decade, offering city land, cash incentives and to cancel or defer development charges and taxes.While there are rent controls on existing units, the new provincial government has dropped them on new construction in an effort to entice development. Some builders such as Tricon Capital Group Inc. have already jumped on the affordable bandwagon.Affordable housing needs to be created for those who “are not investment bankers or cannabis entrepreneurs,” RioCan REIT Chief Executive Officer Ed Sonshine said in an earnings call in October. RioCan is interested in getting into the market, but government incentives needs to be higher, he said in a phone interview.Toronto meanwhile, needs to get more creative to broaden the types of housing available, said Florida, at University of Toronto. Companies could focus on housing that uses pre-treated timber or modular construction, speedier, cheaper home-building alternatives.“Everyone’s getting priced out,” he said. “My students at the Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto, who are going to be some of the most successful students in Canadian business, are now saying it’s doubtful they could ever afford a single-family home.”Meanwhile, Ross is running out of options as she scrambles to secure future housing. She’s anxiously awaiting to hear back from the lottery which is offering up a one-bedroom unit for $962 including utilities in the redeveloped Regent Park. The former crack haven is now a mixed-used neighbourhood that includes affordable rentals and market-priced condos alongside sports fields, an aquatic centre, community meeting spaces and cafes.The city will likely need dozens of such neighbourhoods to handle the influx in newcomers.At one point, Ross even called a shelter to see what her options would be if she was kicked out of her apartment. “They said you have to call weeks in advance. How do you call weeks in advance if you don’t know when you’re going to be homeless?”–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

Since then, they’ve been little changed even as market transactions have fallen sharply.To be sure, risks remain. Young home buyers have never faced anything other than historically low mortgage rates and many will have to refinance over the next few years, while policy makers remain concerned about a cluster of highly indebted borrowers.Growing signs of a sustainable housing market allow the Bank of Canada to keep moving ahead with modest interest-rate increases in an economy that’s otherwise at full capacity. Government officials can also hold back on new interventions that could spook households.“It looks like we’re settling into this environment in Canada where price growth is going to be flat in real terms,” something that hasn’t happened outside of a recession since the 1990s, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said by phone from Toronto.Prices and sales showed modest gains or losses for October in reports Thursday from the Canadian Real Estate Association and from the Teranet land registry. That’s a switch from most of the last year where they swung in response to tougher mortgage qualification rules and the first interest-rate hiking cycle from the central bank in almost a decade.Home sales held close to their 10-year average after falling for a second month in October, the realtor group said. Benchmark prices rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, and gains in Vancouver and Toronto were close to the national average.Canada would stand out if it comes through its housing boom without a crash like those seen in the U.S., the U.K. or Spain. “Overall, yes the medicine is working,” Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview.“We are reaching some sort of landing, how soft it will be I don’t know, but we aren’t in a free-fall by any stretch of the imagination,” Tal said.Even with the latest figures showing stability, it could take years to unwind the imbalances that have built up. The rise of the million-dollar home in some of Canada’s biggest cities has also created affordability challenges for buyers as builders struggle to offer new supply.“Its absolutely fair to say the Canadian housing market is off the boil,” Lascelles said, adding a note of caution: “There is no pre-ordained conclusion here.”With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"

The Canadian division of London-based HSBC Holdings Plc also cut its five-year fixed rate for some mortgages to 3.09 per cent, the lender said in an emailed statement. Both rates, effective May 17, undercut mortgage offered by Canada’s six-biggest banks, which have been adjusting rates during a spring buying season that’s started out soggy. Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) last week cut its five-year variable rate to 2.45 per cent -- a 1 per centage point discount from the lender’s prime rate -- in a mortgage special that runs until the end of May. Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) followed on May 15, matching the 2.45 per cent rate in a special available until May 31. HSBC has been undercutting the largest domestic banks on mortgages for about a year. Home sales nationwide fell to the lowest in more than five years in April , as bond yields and tougher mortgage qualification rules imposed in January helped cool the market. Canada’s banks are witnessing “a more pronounced"" slowdown in mortgage growth in the second quarter, with a 0.19 per cent growth since the start of the year, Scotia Capital analyst Sumit Malhotra said Wednesday in a note to clients. That’s the slowest in four years. The February-to-April period has “traditionally marked the slowest period of the year for domestic residential real estate loan growth, and our review of recent data clearly indicates that the seasonal deceleration will be more pronounced"" in the banks’ second quarter results which begin next week, he said."

The Toronto-based bank known for its spring mortgage specials is offering a five-year variable rate of 2.45 per cent until the end of May -- 1 percentage point below its prime rate. The special marks the biggest widely advertised discount ever by Canada’s six biggest banks, RateSpy.com founder Robert McLister said. Bank of Montreal’s offer beats discretionary rates of 2.75 percent for similar mortgages by other lenders including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia, according to RateSpy.com. It’s also better than the advertised 2.49 percent variable rate with HSBC Holdings Plc’s Canadian lender, which has been undercutting the largest domestic bank on mortgages for about a year. “Bank mortgage growth is the slowest since 2001, yet there is serious and intensifying competition from players like HSBC and online brokers,"" McLister said Tuesday in a phone interview. “BMO felt that they had to do something, clearly, to maintain a market share and grow in a slowing housing market.” ‘Competitive Environment’ The rate is “reflective of the competitive environment and is a great rate for customers seeking a variable mortgage,"" Paul Gammal, a Bank of Montreal spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Meanwhile, fixed mortgage rates have crept up in the past week as following a rise in bond yields, with typical discretionary rates of around 3.49 per cent -- some 10 basis points higher than in January. Posted rates are higher still, with with Toronto-Dominion Bank pushing its five-year rate up 45 basis points to 5.59 per cent April 25 in one of the biggest increases in years. Scotiabank moved today, lifting its rate 20 basis points to 5.34 per cent. ""You’ve seen a deviation in funding costs between fixed and variable mortgages, so that explains a lot of it,"" McLister said."

Total residential mortgage credit grew just 0.3 per cent on average over the last three months, the slowest since 2001, Bank of Canada data show. That’s down from 0.47 per cent at the end of 2017, and about half the average 0.57 per cent pace over the past twenty years. Outstanding residential mortgage loans in Canada now total $1.53 trillion, the data show. Borrowing costs are rising for the first time in almost a decade, and recent rule changes are making it tougher to get a mortgage. Just how sensitive consumers -- and the economy -- will be to higher rates has become a key question for policy makers, with Canadians now holding a record $1.70 in debt for every dollar of disposable income. Dominique Lapointe, an economist at the University of Ottawa’s Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy sees slowing credit growth as a potential headwind for Canada’s economy, at least in the short run. “In the near term, it’s bad for growth. In the longer-run, when it leads to deleveraging, it’s good for financial stability. What matters is the speed of deceleration, or contraction, in credit,” Lapointe said in an email."

Hannah, president of the Credit Counselling Society, is seeing an influx of clients as higher financing costs begin to bite and people find it harder to manage. Phone calls were up 5.3 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, while online chats increased 40 per cent. He says with debt loads at a record and little in the way of savings to fall back on, Canadians may be “caught off guard” if housing markets cool significantly or North American Free Trade Agreement talks go sideways. “We’ve been in a perfect storm for a number of years” where low interest rates encourage borrowing and discourage saving, Hannah, 60, said by phone from the Vancouver suburb of New Westminster. “People have been lulled into a false sense of security.” Hannah’s organization can help people set up a debt management program or find a licensed insolvency trustee. He’s sounding the alarm as rising interest rates and stricter borrowing rules threaten to squeeze households even further. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its benchmark rate twice more this year and it’s next decision is April 18. CREDIT RELIEF  Hannah’s colleagues dubbed him “Dr. Debt” after he received an honorary degree in 2012 from University Canada West, a private business school, for his “distinguished service in the field of credit counseling.” Prior to establishing the non-profit, registered charity in 1996, he worked for 11 years at Equifax Canada, a credit reporting company, but decided “a nice title and a good salary doesn’t make you happy,” so he left to find something that “made a difference.” He found it by helping people get relief from their creditors. As Hannah tells it, during the early 1990s, the provincial debtor assistance program in British Columbia was cutting back just as bankruptcy rates were rising. A group of banks, credit unions and department stores tried and failed to establish a complementary service. Hannah offered to raise the necessary funds, so long as he was allowed to run the organization. DROP IN THE BUCKET  Twenty-one years later, the society -- with offices from the provincial capital in Victoria to Ottawa -- has assisted more than half a million people. The average client is 43 years old, has $31,000 in outstanding debt and seven creditors. More than half are female. Average gross monthly income is $5,200, and housing costs consume 42 per cent of their net income. The society’s clients repaid $51 million last year, up about 6 per cent. It’s still a drop in the bucket. Canadian household credit totaled a record $2.13 trillion at the end of February, roughly doubling since 2006, central bank data show. Residential mortgages account for 72 per cent of that. The rest includes credit cards, lines of credit and auto loans. People carrying large debt loads still feel ahead of the game because home prices keep rising, Hannah said. “What happens when the economy has a downturn, like in Alberta. We know what happened. We’re still seeing the impact of that,” he said, adding people in the oil-rich province were “caught off guard, and because of a lack of savings, many people lost their homes, had to sell their assets and start over again.” Some observers argue Canada’s household debt isn’t a problem because asset ratios and home equity levels are also high and the country’s labor market is strong. A report from the Canadian Banker’s Association this week showed the national mortgage arrears rate through January was 0.24 per cent, close to the lowest in three decades. Hannah doesn’t buy it. Low arrears and delinquency rates “don’t tell the whole story,” because a robust housing market is masking financial strains, he said. “If a person’s had difficulty keeping up with the mortgage payment, it’s been relatively easy just to sell your home,” said Hannah. “What happens though when you have a tight market and it’s not as easy to sell your home? That’s when you’ll see delinquency rates start to rise.”"

(BAC.N) is looking at packaging riskier Canadian mortgages into bonds, as rules designed to cool the housing market may spur demand for the securities.",0,,0,,2018-02-07,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bank-of-america-said-to-explore-canada-s-uninsured-mbs-market-1.991009,,"Bank of America Corp. (BAC.N) is looking at packaging riskier Canadian mortgages into bonds, as rules designed to cool the housing market may spur demand for the securities. The bank has met with Canadian lenders to assess their interest in supplying mortgages for the bonds, which would be backed by home loans that don’t have government guarantees, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was also considering discussing the sale of the securities with U.S. investors, according to a government memo from June obtained through a records request. Bank of America declined to comment through a spokeswoman. The firm is the latest to consider selling these securities after the nation’s regulators made it harder for consumers to qualify for government insurance on mortgages. The new rules, and others that followed, were meant to reduce demand in Canada’s stretched housing market by making it harder for individuals to borrow. They also cut the government’s risk. ‘Unique Position’ The impact from the rule changes on home prices, mortgage-credit growth, consumer behavior, and mortgage funding may not appear until at least the second half of 2018, Sanjay Narine, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in a Jan. 29 report. “The market is in a unique position and offers an opportunity for all participants to ‘get it right’ and preserve gains, maintain competition, and foster a private-label RMBS market that is a deep, liquid, and sustainable,” he said. Banks may be looking at this market, but for now it’s tiny. There are two offerings outstanding: around US$200 million of the securities from a 2014 sale by alternative lender MCAP Corp. and a small portion of the bonds backed by US$2 billion of uninsured mortgages from Bank of Montreal issued last year. Transactions Pulled Previous efforts to kick-start a market for bonds backed by uninsured home loans have stalled as investors remain concerned about over-valuation in Toronto and Vancouver’s housing markets and record consumer debt levels. Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada sounded investor interest last year in two separate deals. The transactions didn’t go ahead after regulators said mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. failed to properly disclose possible loan-application fraud, leading to a liquidity crisis and emergency bailout by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The market for bonds backed by government insured home loans is much bigger. There are some US$463 billion of the bonds known as National Housing Act securities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been selling them since 2005. Even so, there’s a growing number of possible borrowers. About three-quarters of the new mortgages created by federally regulated banks last year didn’t have government support, according to a recent Bank of Canada report. Nearly 50 per cent of the US$1.5 trillion in outstanding mortgages in Canada are uninsured, thanks to the tighter rules. The measures are showing some signs of cooling the housing market, too. Sales in Toronto, Canada’s biggest city, plunged 22 per cent in January. A security backed by uninsured mortgages will need to offer higher yields than government-insured residential mortgage bonds -- perhaps as much as a half percentage point more, the S&P report said. Disclosure of the actual mortgages in the collateral pool would improve pricing for issuers, the report said. Broadening the investor base to the U.S. would also help pricing, the government memo said. Home Capital Chief Financial Officer Brad Kotush said in a recent statement that the lender would consider becoming involved in the uninsured mortgage-backed securities market if the opportunity made sense for its funding strategy."

Lisa Williams, who was previously in charge of multi-unit insurance, replaces Zielonka, who has left the agency. Zielonka was CFO since September 2016 and worked for Ottawa-based CMHC since 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile. He couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. The shuffle at CMHC comes amid rapid changes in the Canada mortgage market. The government is trying to reduce taxpayer exposure to the market and has implemented a slate of new regulations to curb rising home prices and household indebtedness, including stress tests that went into effect this year making it harder to qualify for mortgages. Amid the changes, home-buyers have been flocking to the uninsured segment. They made up about three-quarters of new loans at federally regulated banks in 2017, up from two-thirds in 2014, the Bank of Canada said last year. Roughly 90 percent of new mortgages in Toronto and Vancouver are now uninsured. Canada’s housing market suffered one of its biggest upsets last year after Home Capital Group Inc. disclosed that 45 independent brokers submitted loan applications that misstated borrowers’ income and other details, nearly sinking the alternative lender, and stoking fears of a housing slump in Canada. In December, Laurentian Bank of Canada reported similar customer misrepresentations on some of its mortgage loans sold to another firm. Other changes at CMHC include the combination of the agency’s mortgage insurance and securitization groups under the newly created position of chief commercial officer to be led by Romy Bowers, who was previously chief risk officer. Bowers is replaced by Steven Mennill, former senior vice president of insurance. The vacant chief of staff position was filled by Anik Génier, formerly director of corporate relations."

According Mortgage Professionals Canada’s “Annual State of the Residential Mortgage Market in Canada”, stress-testing of mortgages will prevent an estimated 6-7.5 per cent of Canadians from achieving housing goals, even if those goals appear “reasonable” and “responsible.” “As a result of the policies’ excessive stringency (using interest rates that are too high), housing activity will be reduced to an unnecessary degree,” the report states. “The homeownership rate in Canada has fallen, as young, middle-class Canadians have found it increasingly difficult to make first-time purchases,” the study’s author and MPC chief economist Will Dunning said in a statement. “With the recent further tightening of mortgage rules, ownership challenges have been intensified, and the ownership rate is very likely to fall further.” The study also estimates that 200,000 Canadian families will fail the new uninsured stress tests by the time Canada next heads to the polls for an election. However, the study also found that Canadians still see homeownership – and the debt that comes with it – as a good investment. While total debt among homeowners is rapidly expanding, the level of regret experienced among homeowners is on the decline, which MPC says can be attributed to higher equity ratios. The group also found that regret over homeownership diminishes as the buyers get used to, and begin to repay, that debt. “During the past decade, some commentators have taken a negative outlook of the housing market. Yet, Canadians have consistently shown confidence in residential real estate,” MPC President and CEO Paul Taylor said in a statement. “These surveys have told us repeatedly that Canadians are happy with the real estate decisions they have made.” On a scale of one-to-10 Canadians averaged a 3.67 when asked to react to the statement “I regret taking on the size of my mortgage.” While this is up from the 3.60 score in 2016, it is down substantially from the 2010-2014 scores that ranged from 3.82 to 4.04."

At the margin, this significant move by the regulator acts as a de-facto tightening and reduces the amount of additional Bank of Canada rate hikes required in 2018.” Phil Soper, CEO, Royal LePage: The new OSFI mortgage regulations should mitigate the runaway mega-city prices risk, but they do introduce new challenges. ...The new government policy will land squarely on move-up buyers looking to use their home’s equity to finance a new purchase. Some will not be able to get the home they had intended and will withdraw from the market. Others may look to less expensive properties, driving activity and prices in the lower-end of the market."" Tim Hudak, CEO, Ontario Real Estate Association: ""While realtors support a sensibly regulated real estate market, OSFI’s new stress test for uninsured mortgages is overkill. These changes will hurt middle class families and punish careful savers the most, forcing them to take on more debt and higher interest payments. It’s time for governments to hit the brakes on more demand side policy interventions and take a wait and see approach."" David Madani, Senior Canada Economist, Capital Economics: ""This will have a far greater impact on house prices than the Bank of Canada recent interest rate hikes."" Brian DePratto, Senior Economist, TD Economics: ""Broadening the stress test will likely further slow housing activity, depressing demand by five per cent to 10 per cent once implemented, with some pull-forward of activity likely to take place ahead of the January 1st implementation date. Price growth will also be impacted, with these changes expected to exert a drag of between two per cent and four per cent over 2018."" Will Dunning, Chief Economist, Mortgage Professionals Canada: ""Let's say this policy reduces housing activity by 10-15 per cent — which is a standard estimate. That would mean, two years from now, there would be fewer jobs than there would otherwise be. So, 100,000-150,000 fewer jobs than would otherwise have been as a result of this policy."""
