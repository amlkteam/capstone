The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund\u2019s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.\u201cThe Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,\u201d the company said in a fund document on its website. \u201cThe social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.\u201dThe fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company\u2019s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.\u2018Pandemic Effects\u2019The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada\u2019s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201d The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn\u2019t say how long the freeze would last to \u201cavoid building unrealistic expectations\u201d.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Maloney and John Gittelsohn", "title": "Elon Musk puts two homes up for sale after vow to sell most possessions", "description": "He's seeking a combined US$39.5 million for the Bel Air properties, including one that was previously owned by the late Gene Wilder", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/elon-musk-puts-two-homes-up-for-sale-after-vow-to-sell-most-possessions", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/elon-musk-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020 1:59 PM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc.

In another, he said he believed Tesla\u2019s stock price was too high, prompting a 10 per cent plunge on the day.As for high-end Los Angeles real estate, it\u2019s not exactly a seller\u2019s market at the moment. Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings. Fewer buyers were coming from China, Russia and the Middle East amid international tensions, and limits on state and local tax deductions dampened the appeal of owning California homes for wealthy U.S. buyers.With demand slowing, more and more would-be sellers are taking their homes off the market, said Beverly Hills real estate agent Jade Mills. But shrinking inventory means some homes will still find buyers.\u201cPeople are still having to move and relocate, even within California,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing people still having to buy and sell.

Musk ranks No. 24 on the list, with a US$35.9 billion fortune. Tesla rebounded Monday, advancing 4.7 per cent to US$734.08 at 1:38 p.m. in New York.Musk bought the two homes in 2012 and 2013 for a total of about US$24 million.

The statement repeated language from March 15 saying the committee would keep the benchmark target range near zero \u201cuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201dU.S. stocks held gains after the Fed\u2019s statement while yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged up slightly to 0.62 per cent.Regarding asset purchases, the FOMC used wording similar to last month, saying the buying of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will continue \u201cin the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\u201dWednesday\u2019s statement acknowledged the extent and breadth of the damage being wraught by the ongoing contagion.\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThe virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.\u201dIt made specific mention of lower oil prices and their role in holding down inflation.Policy makers also began to extend cautiously the time frame within which they see the economic blow from the virus lasting, though they are still offering no precise forecast.\u201cThe ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,\u201d the committee said.The central bank has mounted an unprecedented push to limit the economic harm of the virus, which has plunged the global economy into recession and likely sent U.S. unemployment well above 10% after businesses shuttered to slow the contagion.Government data released earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 4.8 per cent rate in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'Never seen anything as catastrophic': Malls in Canada face massive hit as unpaid rent surges", "description": "In the country's enclosed regional malls \u2014 a category that includes Toronto's Eaton Centre \u2014 only 20 per cent to 25 per cent of tenants paid rent in April", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/malls-face-catastrophic-hit-in-canada-with-unpaid-rent-surging?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/eaton-centre.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 7:04 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s malls are facing a wave of skipped rents and could see vacancy rates triple by year-end, with the coronavirus poised to leave its scars on a fragile retail sector long after the pandemic ends.In the country\u2019s enclosed regional malls \u2014 a category that includes Toronto\u2019s Eaton Centre and Pacific Centre in Vancouver \u2014 only 20 per cent to 25 per cent of tenants paid rent in April, according to brokerage firm JLL Canada. Big box shopping centres and community strip malls took in only a little over half their expected rent.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business over 30 years and I have never seen anything as catastrophic or as impactful in a negative way in our business,\u201d Tim Sanderson, who heads retail at JLL Canada, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the mid-tier smaller-scale landlord that cannot make their mortgage payments to their lender that are going to be in trouble.\u201dMalls and main-street shops, bastions of community commerce, were already under pressure after two years of weak retail sales, rising property taxes and the shift to e-commerce. Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That\u2019s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year \u2014 a level Sanderson describes as \u201cvery tight.\u201d\u201cMany retailers are in trouble,\u201d Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. \u201cI think when we get to the other side of this, there\u2019s a real reckoning to be had.\u201dI think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.RioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Once seen as safer than gold, Canadian real estate braces for the 'Great Reckoning'", "description": "The real estate industry is now in a state of paralysis with households among the world's most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-real-estate-great-reckoning-covid-19?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 16, 2020 1:10 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian housing once seemed so infallible that the head of the world\u2019s biggest asset manager in 2015 described Vancouver condos as a better store of wealth than gold.The coronavirus is putting that theory to the test.While lockdowns, job losses and uncertainty are roiling property markets from the U.K. to Australia to Hong Kong, Canada\u2019s situation is more precarious than most.

Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada set for bigger buying spree \u2014 here\u2019s where the billions might go", "description": "Next up may be provincial debt which is showing signs of credit strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-for-bigger-buying-spree-decision-day-guide", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stephen-poloz-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 6:00 AM EDT", "content": "As Stephen Poloz goes into his penultimate policy meeting as Bank of Canada governor on Wednesday, economists are trying to gauge how much of a buying mood he\u2019s in.With the country suffering one of its sharpest downturns since the Great Depression, Poloz is widely expected to dig deeper into his unconventional toolkit, whether that\u2019s at the April 15 meeting or later. The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.One thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?The central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Australia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "One of Canada's largest private lenders halts redemptions", "description": "Bridging Finance said in an letter to investors Monday that it has gated its funds indefinitely 'to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/one-of-canadas-largest-private-lenders-halts-redemptions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/money-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 2:26 PM EDT", "content": "One of Canada\u2019s largest private lenders is freezing redemptions.Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors Monday that it has gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201dThe non-bank lender has $1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) in assets under management with the most of its direct lending funds invested in collateral-based bridging loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Request for redemptions spiked to about 15 per cent of the assets from the usual 5 per cent, which prompted the gating, Chief Executive Officer David Sharpe said by phone.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest.

He graduated from Boston-based Emerson College in 2009, just as the Great Recession gutted the jobs market for years.He spent his first few years after school fighting for low-paid work as a production assistant. His mentors told him, \u201c\u2018Dude, you missed the good years by like five years,\u2019\u201d he said.A decade later, just as he had built up savings and was preparing to buy a house, the 31-year-old is out of a job again. The coronavirus outbreak has dried up production gigs in Hollywood, where he works.No age group will escape the pain of the current economic slowdown, but millennials were already on more precarious financial footing than their elders. They left college with unprecedented levels of student debt and missed out on crucial years of wage growth because of the 2008 downturn.Compared to other groups at the same point in their lives, people in their 20s and 30s have relatively low levels of home ownership, net worth and real income, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper.\u201cThey\u2019re walking a tight rope and there are cliffs on either side,\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine someone making it through both of these recessions in this age group really unscathed.\u201dEconomic downturns are inevitable, but they\u2019re not usually so severe. And once-in-a-generation recessions don\u2019t tend to occur just a decade apart.For millennials, the timing of these events has been particularly damaging. People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been \u201cmuch larger\u201d than previous downturns.Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person\u2019s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn\u2019t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They\u2019re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, \u201cI worry even more about the people without college diplomas.\u201dWhile white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.\u201cIt could be a problem if the unemployment stops,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201d\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201d\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201d\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201d\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'This is freezing the market': Once roaring, Canadian home sales brace for 30% drop from coronavirus", "description": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-home-sales-30-percent-drop-coronavirus?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 2, 2020 12:23 PM EDT", "content": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home. One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201dReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dStill, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts", "description": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.\u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.Toronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.The Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's big banks have already fielded 213,000 requests for mortgage deferrals", "description": "Banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadas-big-banks-field-213000-requests-for-mortgage-deferrals?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/banks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 10:28 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s biggest banks have fielded hundreds of thousands of requests from homeowners seeking to hold off making mortgage payments under a new coronavirus-related relief plan.More than 213,000 requests to defer payments have been completed or are being processed since the country\u2019s six largest banks announced the plan last week, Mathieu Labreche, a spokesman for the Canadian Bankers Association, said Thursday in an interview.\u201cThe large number of customers that have been helped continues to grow as the result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, contact-centre agents and operations teams working diligently,\u201d he said.Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced.

But the Fed\u2019s move opens the door to a more robust response from Canadian policy makers.\u201cThe Bank of Canada doesn\u2019t like being pushed by the Fed, but now it\u2019s global,\u201d said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist at Bank of Montreal, which sees an 80 per cent chance the central bank will need to start quantitative easing.\u201cThe question is why they\u2019d wait until April \u2014 given the broad shutdowns it\u2019s already clear that conditions have deteriorated sharply,\u201d he said.While Poloz said last week that other options are on the table, he made it clear the measures the bank has taken so far \u2014 including upping the purchases of mortgage-backed securities \u2014 don\u2019t constitute quantitative easing.\u201cThe programs the bank has introduced are very important in unlocking funding markets,\u201d Ian Pollick, global head of non-equity market research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cThe problem is, liquidity is so distressed that they are not working as planned. They need to bring out the Canadian bazooka,\u201d adding that he\u2019s certain the central bank will \u201cimminently\u201d launch QE.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Christopher Condon", "title": "U.S. Federal Reserve pulls out all the stops with unlimited new buying to battle \u2018tremendous hardship\u2019 of coronavirus crisis", "description": "It will begin backstopping an unprecedented range of credit for households, small businesses and major employers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-fed-amounts-aggressive-new-steps-to-combat-coronavirus-hit-to-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/fed-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 23, 2020 1:27 PM EDT", "content": "The Federal Reserve, racing again to contain mounting economic and financial-market fallout from the coronavirus, unveiled a sweeping series of measures that pushed the 106-year old central bank deeper into uncharted territory.In a surprise announcement Monday before markets opened in New York, the U.S. central bank said it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to keep borrowing costs at rock-bottom levels \u2014 and to help ensure chaotic markets function properly. It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed\u2019s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.\u201cWow, just wow,\u201d George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you\u2019ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.\u201dIn a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed\u2019s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.Monday\u2019s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.\u201cThis is not a slush-fund,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That\u2019s on top of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.\u201dBeyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed\u2019s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.\u201cThis is a great step forward,\u201d said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cGetting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Paula Sambo", "title": "Canada beefs up liquidity plan with pledge to buy up to $50 billion in uninsured mortgages", "description": "Changes will allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canada-beefs-up-liquidity-plan-with-expanded-mortgage-guarantee", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 20, 2020 2:14 PM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government announced it will guarantee previously uninsured mortgages, allowing it to acquire these loans in a $50 billion (US$34.8 billion) state purchase program.The step is aimed at making it easier for smaller institutions \u2014 which may not have enough insured loans \u2014 to participate in the liquidity boosting plan, analysts said.\u201cThese are extraordinary times and we are taking extraordinary measures,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this measure, banks and lenders will have more liquidity \u2014 which, in turn, will enable them to work on a case by case basis with Canadian businesses and individuals who face hardship at this time.\u201dThe changes will allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into the so-called National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program, making them eligible to be sold to the government.The mortgage purchase plan is part of a slew of measures from the government, Bank of Canada and the nation\u2019s banking regulator to inject liquidity into the nation\u2019s banking system.The changes will remain in force until December.

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn\u2019t a Goldman Sachs problem. Wall Street\u2019s nonstop aggressiveness is clashing with the demands of a deadly pandemic. As government officials, doctors and companies tell people around the world to stay home, interviews with bankers and traders inside the industry\u2019s giants show many feel torn between public health and private profit.\u201cPeople do come in when they have a cold,\u201d said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. \u201cSometimes you have that old boss where you\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.\u201dWall Street\u2019s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren\u2019t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he\u2019s facing pressure to be \u201ca tough guy\u201d who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there\u2019s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there\u2019s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank\u2019s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren\u2019t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. \u201cIf you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. \u201cTake sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.\u201dThe culture that\u2019s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry\u2019s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country\u2019s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.From their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan\u2019s home-lending group were told they couldn\u2019t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible to bring equipment home yet.\u201cWe have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,\u201d a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. \u201cThe remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.\u201dInside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.\u2019s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.\u201cThere are managers who will say, \u2018We\u2019re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,\u2019\u201d said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. \u201cAnd then there are others who will say, \u2018We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.\u2019\u201dThe tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Some London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank\u2019s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it\u2019s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kait Bolongaro and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Trudeau unveils financial aid worth $82 billion to help Canadians weather coronavirus", "description": "This includes $27 billion in direct support for individuals and companies and $55 billion in tax deferrals for both households and businesses", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-expects-to-unveil-fiscal-stimulus-package-on-wednesday?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trudeau-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 17, 2020 1:57 PM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced plans to roll out a fiscal package worth 3% of Canada\u2019s economy as it grapples with fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The measures will be worth a combined $82 billion (US$56.7 billion), Trudeau said Wednesday in Ottawa. This includes $27 billion in direct support for individuals and companies and $55 billion in temporary tax deferrals for both households and businesses.It\u2019s a significant escalation in Canada\u2019s stimulus package, and the urgency appears to be ramping up by the hour. Late Tuesday night, government officials were only talking about the direct stimulus aspect of the plan.The outlook, however, seems to be deteriorating quickly. The price of Canadian heavy crude slumped Wednesday below US$10 a barrel for the first time after oil-sands producers were forced to delay maintenance, pushing more oil into the market at the worst possible time.\u201cRight now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting an income or revenue because of this COVID-19 challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, pay their rent, and support their families through this difficult time,\u201d Trudeau said.At a separate press conference, Finance Minister Bill Morneau called Wednesday\u2019s measures the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the response and said the government is prepared to do more if needed. \u201cI will do whatever it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be more to come.\u201dGlobal financial markets are continuing to slide as the economic fallout from the pandemic outpaces even the massive response from governments and central banks.Trudeau also confirmed an announcement earlier by President Donald Trump that Canada and the U.S. have agreed to close the world\u2019s longest undefended border to all non-essential traffic.The measures announced Wednesday include steps to bolster child benefit payments, a $10 billion emergency care program to workers who stay home and don\u2019t have access to paid sick leave, and a 10 per cent wage subsidy to eligible small businesses for the next 90 days. The bulk of the support is a plan to allow taxpayers to defer filing until after Aug. 31 \u2014 a temporary liquidity support.Wednesday\u2019s package brings the support offered to businesses and individuals to more than $500 billion during the crisis, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. The country\u2019s banking regulator is loosening capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity, while the country\u2019s housing agency is buying up to $50 billion in mortgages to provide liquidity.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who was also at the Morneau press conference, has cut interest rates by a full percentage over the past two weeks and moved aggressively to keep money flowing through credit markets. Investors are anticipating another half percentage point cut in coming weeks.Asked why he hasn\u2019t moved since the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Sunday, Poloz said he would like the \u201cbenefit of analysis\u201d of the recent fiscal steps and other measures taken by the central bank before deciding on the next steps.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used. The Fed\u2019s key rate is now 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent, matching the record low it was last at in 2015.President Donald Trump, who as recently as Saturday attacked the Fed for not lowering rates faster and further, quickly expressed support for the move.\u201cIt makes me very happy and I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big step and I\u2019m very happy they did it.\u201dU.S. stock futures tumbled steeply after the announcement, as investors worried that emergency measures by the Fed would fall short in countering the virus\u2019s damage to the economy. Treasury futures surged in early Asia trading, giving rise to expectations that parts of the U.S. yield curve could soon turn negative.Powell told reporters on the call that the rate decision Sunday is in lieu of the Fed\u2019s regularly scheduled meeting this week, planned for Tuesday and Wednesday.The action comes as the U.S. economy faces sharply curtailed activity in everything from basketball games, to dining out and travel. That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession. Stocks have already tumbled into a bear market.\u201cThe Fed cannot combat a public health crisis, but they can provide a helpful hand when the crisis abates,\u201d said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economic research at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.The Fed said it will keep interest rates near zero \u201cuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201dThe central bank acted the day before leaders from the Group of Seven nations, including Trump, are set to discuss their virus response on a teleconference. Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move \u2014 alone \u2014 failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they\u2019re really inventing new stuff,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.\u201cThis is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is.

None of Canada\u2019s other big banks has achieved such a fevered growth rate in almost two years, with Royal Bank grabbing a greater portion of the $992.4 billion (US$742.5 billion) mortgage market spread among the country\u2019s five largest lenders. Among those companies, Royal Bank\u2019s market share is now 27.4 per cent.\u201cIt\u2019s demonstrative of our investments both in digital and distribution and talent,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview after Royal Bank reported first-quarter results. \u201cWe had been adding resources in the field while some of our competition was reducing their face-to-face advice.\u201dRoyal Bank\u2019s push comes as a rebound in housing takes hold. Home prices in some of Canada\u2019s largest cities including Toronto have recently climbed to records amid a shortage of properties for sale. Including lenders outside the big banks, the nation\u2019s mortgage market in December expanded 4.9 per cent from a year earlier to $1.63 trillion, Bank of Canada monthly data show. That marked a rebound from February 2019, when growth was the paltriest in 18 years.Royal Bank has pulled further ahead of competitors including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal, and even extended its lead over Bank of Nova Scotia, which has been No. 2 in mortgage growth since the latter half of 2018. At Scotiabank, mortgage balances rose 5.3 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in two years.Royal Bank is the country\u2019s largest mortgage lender, based on an average balance of $271.8 billion in the first quarter.\u201cWe are bringing a broader spectrum of advice and solutions to our clients, and when we do that we expect to continue to increase market share,\u201d Bolger said, adding that Royal Bank is wooing customers with internet-based tools including OJO Home, an artificial intelligence-powered property search for Greater Toronto, and MoveSnap, an online concierge service for moving-related tasks.The mortgage-growth revival comes as the government tweaks loan-qualification \u201cstress test\u201d criteria and the spring homebuying season approaches. Bank executives, who have spent recent years dealing with the risks of an overheated housing market, are largely shrugging off such concerns this time around.\u201cSales activity has been solid, price performance is generally up in the market and it doesn\u2019t feel overly frothy,\u201d Bank of Montreal CFO Tom Flynn said in a phone interview this week.At Flynn\u2019s bank, the domestic mortgage book rose 2.9 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2017, in what he said was a reflection of healthy market conditions.Toronto-Dominion\u2019s domestic mortgage balances rose 3.5 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2016.\u201cDefinitely the volume of transactions in the market do seem to be picking up and the market does seem to be active again,\u201d Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said in an interview, adding that he expects \u201cmid-single-digit\u201d growth rate in Canadian mortgage volumes for the rest of the year.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, once the market leader for mortgage growth, increased home-loan balances by just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter after seeing its book contract for most of last year.

This comes after criticism that the policy was too tight and unfairly kept younger, first-time buyers out the market.The gap between the old qualifying rate and the new rate is about 30 basis points, which will allow the median household in Canada to buy $13,500 (US$9,800) in extra real estate, according to CIBC\u2019s Benjamin Tal.

Instead, investors are turning their attention to the country\u2019s life insurers.In 2019, shares of Canada\u2019s largest lenders gained 14 per cent, including dividends, lagging the S&P/TSX Composite\u2019s 23 per cent total return \u2014 the first time they have trailed the benchmark since 2010. Banks have struggled to eke out strong earnings results as rising loan losses and eroding net interest margins hurt their profitability amid economic growth concerns. That pushed analysts to temper their forecasts for 2020.Life insurers, on the other hand, enjoyed a 40 per cent surge in 2019. Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. posted third-quarter profits last year that topped analysts\u2019 expectations, as gains in Asia fuelled earnings growth.The banks were performing very well until September 2018, \u201cand then the bloom went off the rose,\u201d said John Kinsey, a portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Some investors have soured on banks because of concerns about declining interest rates, mortgage quality and high levels of consumer debt, which are a risk to the economy.\u201cThe focus changed to the insurers because they hadn\u2019t done well when the banks were performing at their peak,\u201d he said.\u201cLifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcome,\u201d Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a Jan. 28 report. \u201cAs long as growth concerns for the banks remain intense, this trend could continue.\u201dLifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcomeWhen lifecos release fourth-quarter results next week, analysts are expecting them to show a strong finish to 2019. RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic expects they will report a \u201csolid end to a good year with double-digit core EPS growth forecast for all of the lifecos,\u201d reflecting strong equity market performance in the quarter.Investors are betting on insurers after taking a cautious view of the Canadian economy as it suffers a bout of sluggish growth. Traders are anticipating at least one Bank of Canada interest rate cut this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which could continue to hurt the bottom line for banks.Lower interest rates due to a potential economic downturn can also have a negative impact on insurers. But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.\u201cThe relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Dechaine. He also expects them to prioritize share buybacks since several of the companies have \u201cmaterial amounts\u201d of cash.Barclays analyst John Aiken raised his share price targets on Great-West, Manulife and Sun Life in a report last month and said his expectations reflect \u201cstrong profitability and an improving operating environment\u201d heading into reporting season.As their shares rally, valuations for Canadian life insurers are almost on par with banks. The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group. Once Manulife is excluded, \u201cthe sector is trading inline to historical averages and to the Big Six,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home prices rise at fastest pace in more than two years", "description": "Biggest increase since the mortgage stress test was launched", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-prices-post-fastest-annual-gain-in-over-two-years", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 6, 2020 6:38 AM EST", "content": "A shrinking supply of available homes for sale in Canada\u2019s largest city continued to drive prices higher last month, bringing annual increases to the strongest in more than two years.Benchmark prices climbed 1 per cent in January and are up 8.7 per cent from a year earlier, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Thursday.

Tesla had added 36 per cent to its value in the first two days of the week, but by Wednesday afternoon, it was just 7.7 per cent higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12 per cent above Friday\u2019s close.The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an \u201celectrifying run\u201d on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.Tesla shares have \u201chad a Bitcoin-like move and profits are being taken off the table with technical levels being hit,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. The analyst expects the stock to settle in the US$700 range and start moving higher again on the potential of its China business, despite coronavirus fears.The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.\u201cLook, everybody has a pain threshold,\u201d Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Tom Keene Wednesday. \u201cWhen a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.\u201d The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.A sense of caution and some confusion prevailed in the market.\u201cMany investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been \u201ccalm, curious and overall cautious.\u201dThat sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping US$109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday.

Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank earn $14 million (US$10.6 million) a year from each of their domestic branches, distancing themselves from smaller competitors in the process.Bank branches are evolving as customers increasingly rely on mobile phones, websites and automated teller machines for routine transactions, with the drudgery of standing in line to cash a paycheque or shift money between accounts largely left to a bygone era.Canada\u2019s banks have reacted accordingly, shrinking branch sizes, adopting the newest technology and turning once counter-bound tellers into roaming advisers armed with tablets to sell high-margin products and mortgages. That\u2019s paying off: All of the big Canadian banks have posted increases in annual revenue per branch in each of the past three years, and sales have soared substantially from a decade ago.\u201cWe\u2019re growing our investment in innovative formats: university campuses, hospitals, newcomer centres, which is helping us grow our client base,\u201d Royal Bank Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview. \u201cAs we have ramped up our leading digital and mobile applications, customers and clients still like to come to branches for advice.\u201dRoyal Bank is Canada\u2019s leader, with 1,201 branches across the country \u2014 four more than a decade ago, even with the addition of digital-banking options during that period. Annual revenue per branch has soared 70 per cent since 2009. Technology has allowed branch employees to focus on dispensing advice to customers rather than merely handling routine transactions, according to Bolger.\u201cWe continue to free up time for our banking advisers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is helping us to continue to expand our market share, which will then in turn result in higher productivity per branch.\u201dRival Toronto-Dominion, meanwhile, has 1,091 branches nationwide, slightly fewer than a decade ago. Like Royal Bank, it has seen a surge in per-branch revenue, with a 66 per cent increase since 2009. The ratio for each of bank was calculated by dividing annual revenue from Canadian personal-and-commercial banking by the number of domestic branches at the end of each fiscal year.\u201cPeople have been speculating about the future of branches, but we\u2019ve been very clear in our strategy that branches are important to us \u2014 they\u2019re an important contact point for customers who need human advice and human touch,\u201d Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said. \u201cWe continue to see them as a very important part of our strategy.\u201dCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce brings in an average of $10 million in yearly sales, up about 53 per cent from a decade ago, for each of its 1,024 branches.\u201cWe continue to improve our advisory capabilities and focus on having conversations with clients to understand their needs and to provide them with products and services that they need,\u201d said CIBC CFO Hratch Panossian. \u201cThat has had some positive momentum.\u201dCanada\u2019s six largest banks operate 5,578 branches domestically, 2.9 per cent fewer than a decade ago. While the decline isn\u2019t as dramatic as was once predicted by those who thought ATMs and mobile banking would spell an end to bricks-and-mortar locations, branches also aren\u2019t keeping pace with population growth.Canada had 20 branches for every 100,000 adults as of 2018, down from about 25 before the 2008 financial crisis, according to the World Bank. The U.S., in comparison, had about 31 branches per 100,000 adults, down from 35.We've been very clear in our strategy that branches are important to us \u2014 they're an important contact point for customers who need human advice and human touchBank of Nova Scotia reduced its domestic network the most, trimming 6.9 per cent of its branches from a decade ago, to 949 today. Those branches generate an average of $11 million in annual revenue, an amount that has climbed steadily in the past six years.\u201cScotiabank has been adding adviser roles to branches,\u201d spokesman Clancy Zeifman said in an email. \u201cWe have also been investing in technologies and tools to help our employees be more productive, including removing manual processes so they can spend more time focusing on our customers.\u201dWhile branches remain important for Bank of Montreal, CFO Tom Flynn said he expects a gradual decline in both the number of branches and average size amid a push toward digital banking. Canada\u2019s fourth-largest lender has 891 domestic locations, which generate about $9 million in annual sales on average, a 55 per cent jump from 2009.\u201cWe want to be close to people when they\u2019re doing transactions that are bigger and really important to them,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cAt the same time, total branch traffic is down, given the digital migration, and in response to that we have been and will continue to take the average square footage of our branch network down.\u201dNational Bank of Canada has the lowest annual revenue per branch, at $8.2 million for each of its 422 locations, though that\u2019s still 60% higher than a decade ago. The Montreal-based lender, the smallest among Canada\u2019s Big Six banks, may lag behind its larger rivals partly because of its regional focus.\u201cWe are located in the province of Quebec, where people are less in debt \u2014 they borrow less,\u201d Jean Dagenais, senior vice president of finance, said in an interview.

Underlying price pressures have been steady and on target for well over a year, suggesting the economy has been running near capacity. Canada is also home to some of the highest household debt levels in the world, constraining the central bank\u2019s ability to cut further for fear of encouraging even more borrowing.\u201cWe think we\u2019ve got monetary conditions about right given the situation,\u201d Poloz said at his last public appearance on Nov. 21. The Canadian economy is \u201cstill in a good place overall.\u201dPressure on the Bank of Canada to match rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve is easing anyhow. Markets have begun paring back bets that global monetary loosening has much left to go.Swaps trading shows about a 4 per cent chance of a cut in Ottawa on Wednesday, and only one-in-four odds of a move at the next meeting in January. All 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the Bank of Canada holding steady on Wednesday.To be sure, the Bank of Canada has begun hedging its bets by talking about the possibility of a cut if needed, a nod to the growing risks from the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Poloz could lower rates if he sees the uncertainty spilling over into the nation\u2019s economy, particularly if it begins to crimp consumer sentiment.But it will be a delicate balancing act. With the economy near its capacity, policy makers will want to see either a clear materialization of downside risks to the global economy \u2014 for example, the collapse of talks between China and the U.S. \u2014 or some evidence domestically that the anticipated slowdown is sharper than expected..Third-quarter output data released Friday showed a benign picture, however. The economy did slow to an annualized pace of 1.3 per cent, but growth came in exactly as forecast by the Bank of Canada. Exporters, the most exposed to the global trade tensions, struggled as expected, but business investment surprised with a strong rebound. That, along with the pick up in consumption and housing and upward revisions to growth, will give policy makers plenty of positives to draw on as they deliberate policy this week.While there doubts remain about whether the jump in business investment is sustainable, consumption and housing seem to be on more solid footing \u2014 supported by a robust jobs market, cheaper mortgage loans thanks to lower global bond yields and accelerated wage gains.After the slowdown in the second half of 2019, growth should accelerate over the next two years back to around its potential as business investment and exports recover, and consumption growth holds steady, the Bank of Canada estimates. There are no obvious clues yet in the data that should knock the central bank off that view.That\u2019s not counting additional stimulus expected down the line from Justin Trudeau\u2019s government. The prime minister has pledged to ramp up federal deficits to $27 billion (US$20.3 billion) next year, bringing the budget gap to about 1.1 per cent of gross domestic product from about 0.9 per cent this year.The next couple of weeks should provide the first taste of what\u2019s in store, as lawmakers reconvene on Thursday.

According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country\u2019s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent in the prior period.It\u2019s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation\u2019s households cope with high debt levels.Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn\u2019t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That\u2019s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January.Canada\u2019s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they\u2019ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3 per cent since June in volume terms.

While the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth.

So we\u2019ve been adding to stocks in two different trades,\u201d Riopelle said.She still sees value in U.S. stocks:\u201cWe still think the U.S. market can generate positive returns over the next 12 months.\u201dOn the long list of risks that Riopelle and her team monitor, protectionism and U.S.-China trade are a big focus. While U.S. politics hog the headlines, investors aren\u2019t paying as much attention to it, she said. Canadian investors frequently ask about the housing market, interest rates and oil prices with half of the nation\u2019s benchmark index heavily weighted to financials and energy stocks.Riopelle oversees multiple funds under the Select banner, including the RBC Select Balanced Portfolio, the biggest investment fund in Canada with $37 billion of assets.

But shifting strategies and inconsistencies have frustrated investors, including a mortgage misstep that saw CIBC go from leader to laggard in two years.CIBC is the only major Canadian bank to see its mortgage book shrink this year \u2014 something that\u2019s particularly problematic given that home loans are it\u2019s biggest consumer product.\u201cCandidly, I think we went too far left in slowing things down, put the brakes on too hard,\u201d Dodig, 54, told investors at a banking conference in September. \u201cWe\u2019re readjusting for that.\u201dThe bank lags behind peers on many financial measures: CIBC is the only Canadian bank to see profit shrink so far this year, with a 2.2 per cent decline. Revenue growth is less than half that of its bigger rivals. Profit at its biggest and most important division, Canadian personal and small-business banking, is down 10 per cent. Return on equity, a profitability measure, has been falling since 2016.Dodig will be under pressure to show improvement when the Toronto-based lender reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results, scheduled for Dec. 5.CIBC shares have underperformed the 22 per cent return of the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index since Dodig became CEO in September 2014, with its 8 per cent gain trailing all of Canada\u2019s Big Six lenders except Bank of Nova Scotia.The bank\u2019s shares trade at a discount despite CIBC\u2019s \u201cde-risking\u201d efforts because of management\u2019s inability to communicate its changing strategies to investors, according to Barclays Plc bank analyst John Aiken.\u201cPeople are scratching their heads, trying to figure out exactly where things are heading,\u201d Aiken said in an interview. \u201cConcern has shifted away from risk into strategy, growth and outlook \u2014 and CIBC is still viewed as the bank with more issues from an investment standpoint.\u201dIn his early days, Dodig looked to be on the right track. He achieved his initial goals of accelerating earnings growth to 5 per cent to 10 per cent between 2016 and 2018, and achieving $4.9 billion of annual profit at the end of that period. But 2019 has been challenging and CIBC\u2019s drive to continue increasing earnings is under threat, with Dodig warning investors in May to expect \u201crelatively flat\u201d growth this fiscal year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we haven\u2019t achieved the same level of performance in the first three quarters of 2019,\u201d Dodig said in an email. \u201cWhile it\u2019s tempting to change course when things get tough, we must take a long-term view of our strategy and focus on creating long-term value.\u201dCIBC\u2019s mixed messages on mortgages and acquisitions are examples of issues that have confused investors, said Steve Belisle, a senior portfolio manager with Manulife Investment Management.\u201cIt feels like management can\u2019t really have a strategy and stick to it,\u201d said Belisle, who holds CIBC along with other Canadian banks. \u201cThey keep changing what they\u2019re saying and keep changing what they\u2019re doing, depending on what they think their stock price will benefit from.\u201dThe US$5-billion takeover of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp in June 2017 \u2014 CIBC\u2019s largest acquisition in its 152-year history, and a move designed to counter investor concerns that the bank is too Canadian \u2014 was criticized by those expecting a smaller deal.When Dodig took over in 2014, he earmarked as much as $2 billion (US$1.8 billion) for U.S. wealth-management deals. Within two years, that swelled to a $4-billion budget for deals that could include private banking or a commercial lender. PrivateBancorp exceeded that, though CIBC was hurt by bad timing: Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory drove bank stock prices up, forcing CIBC to increase its initial US$3.8-billion offer to win over PrivateBancorp investors.\u201cWe needed capabilities on both sides of the border to grow key client relationships, and we\u2019re pleased the acquisition became accretive well ahead of schedule,\u201d Dodig said in an emailed statement. \u201cI would do this deal again any day.\u201dCIBC\u2019s U.S. push comes years after bigger rivals Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal made substantial forays south of the border and reaped rewards from the American exposure, giving them rising profits and diversification beyond their home turf.Dodig has made other changes to recast CIBC. He pursued small deals to build up its U.S. capital-markets operation and sold some businesses. This month, CIBC agreed to pare ownership in CIBC FirstCaribbean by selling a 67 per cent stake, though at a reduced value from its earlier investment. He\u2019s moving the bank to new headquarters after a century at Toronto\u2019s financial district, leasing as much as 1.75 million square feet at a nearby complex under construction called CIBC Square.Dodig\u2019s challenge is convincing investors he\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201cWe recognize there have been cases where we could have more clearly communicated with investors and we\u2019ll take that feedback and act on it \u2014 because we have the right strategy and we need to ensure it is consistently articulated and well understood,\u201d Dodig said.Ironically, the bank\u2019s poor share performance \u2014 CIBC has become the cheapest Canadian bank stock based on price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 may make the stock more attractive.\u201cEverybody has noticed the underperformance and CIBC now has a smaller valuation than National Bank, and that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d Baskin\u2019s Schwartz said, adding that he\u2019s thinking about buying shares. \u201cThis could be the one to break out.

So far in 2019, there have been 102,023 consumer insolvencies, the second-most for the first nine months of a year in records dating back to 1987.While the increases are coming from low levels, the trend is a worrying development that suggests cracks are starting to appear in Canada\u2019s household debt landscape, at least for the most extended individuals. That would be all the more concerning, since it could foreshadow pressure on the country\u2019s financial system. And it\u2019s a bit of a puzzle, given the economic backdrop has been positive, including an unemployment rate that\u2019s dropped to historically low levels.\u201cNormally there\u2019s a story you can tell, like there\u2019s some underlying weakness that shows up with a bit of a lag in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies,\u201d said Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to see that now. It\u2019s perplexing.\u201dInsolvencies are accelerating at a pace that\u2019s been associated with periods of distress: the start of the 2008-09 financial crisis, immediately before the 1990-92 recession, and during the period of pronounced economic weakness in 1995-96 that was tied to the Mexican peso crisis.The significance of the latest data is open to debate. For one thing, the insolvency numbers are at odds with other indicators that show a more benign environment for household debt. For instance, mortgage arrears were 0.23 per cent nationally at the end of July, close to the lowest they\u2019ve ever been, and delinquency rates on non-mortgage debt remain subdued.It's perplexingIn addition, a strong labour market, rising wages, interest rates that are lower than they were at the start of the year and a recovery in home prices all suggest borrowers should have more breathing room, not less.It\u2019s \u201chard to square\u201d the jump in insolvencies with that backdrop, according to David Tulk, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t a trend that would represent the average borrower, but is instead catching the fringe that have over-extended themselves,\u201d he said in an email.That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s downplaying the insolvency numbers, but rather they confirm his prior concerns about Canadian households. \u201cWhat I worry about more is that households use the retrenchment in rates to add even more leverage, and then we get an employment shock,\u201d he said.Brett House is more sanguine. While the latest surge in filings is \u201ca bit concerning\u201d given low unemployment and low interest rates, the deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto said \u201cthere are a number of important factors that temper the implications of the September print.\u201dFor one thing, the share of insolvencies to the total amount of household debt is falling. There were 5.3 filings for every $1 billion ($760 million) in total household debt as of September, versus 17.8 in 1997.Adjusting for population growth, the numbers also looks less dramatic. For instance, some 0.06 per cent of the Canadian workforce filed for insolvency, based on September numbers, versus 0.09 per cent a decade ago \u2014 though the rate has moved higher over the past 20 years.Tulk said he won\u2019t read too much into one month\u2019s worth of insolvency data. But if next month\u2019s print shows a further increase and if things look shaky elsewhere, \u201cI will be sufficiently nervy,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canadian housing once again driving our economy even as Toronto stumbles", "description": "Strength of western provinces shows sustained national recovery", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-decline-vancouver-recovery-leave-canadian-home-sales-flat", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/calgary-house.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 15, 2019 11:12 AM EST", "content": "Canadian housing sales took a breather as activity in Toronto pulled back, but strength in the western provinces highlights a sustained recovery at the national level.Home sales were little changed in October after seven straight months of gains, according to data released Friday by the Canadian Real Estate Association.

The Toronto-based lender traded at $28.86 at 1:26 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and has been hovering at levels last seen in February 2017, before the stock plunged as Ontario\u2019s securities regulator accused the company of misleading shareholders over falsified mortgage applications.Alternative lenders including Home Capital and Equitable Group Inc. have seen their stocks surge this year as the pace of mortgage growth picked up during the spring home-buying season, and home sales recovered in major cities including Toronto and Vancouver.The \u201csignificant\u201d share price appreciation of the alternative lenders is reflective of improving housing conditions \u2014 particularly in Greater Toronto \u2014 as well as a benign credit environment and robust mortgage growth outlook, CIBC analyst Marco Giurleo said in a Nov. 1 note to clients.

Compensation per employee at the Toronto-based firm is up 18.6 per cent since fiscal 2007 when adjusted for nominal wage growth, according to company filings and calculations by Bloomberg. That\u2019s made Chief Executive Officer Darryl White\u2019s mission to improve efficiencies more difficult.Canada\u2019s biggest banks are more profitable than ever, with years of low interest rates and a stable economy fuelling record consumer borrowing, and strong housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto spurring demand for mortgages. Like their counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the firms are increasingly turning to technology and automation to drive down costs.That\u2019s good for the banks, but less beneficial for workers: Average compensation across the biggest Canadian lenders is down 1.8 per cent over 11 years. Canadian banks that have made big forays into the U.S., as well as other regions with high wages, are bucking that trend.Bank of Montreal, which owns Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, took over Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in 2011, U.K. fund manager F&C Asset Management in 2014 and a transportation-finance business from General Electric Co. the following year, and there have been additional capital-markets deals in the U.S. since. Those acquisitions have swelled Bank of Montreal\u2019s ranks \u2014 with higher-paid professionals to boot.The company, meanwhile, has been working to control its expenses. It\u2019s targeting an adjusted efficiency ratio \u2014 a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue \u2014 of 58 per cent or better by the end of fiscal 2021. In the third quarter, it was 59.9 per cent, the lowest in at least six years.\u201cOur bank-wide revenue per employee is among the highest in the Canadian banking sector and, as a consequence, our cost per employee is on the higher side as well \u2014 the two items are very much related,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an email. \u201cWe continue to make progress on improving the bank\u2019s overall efficiency.\u201dIt\u2019s not the only Canadian bank whose compensation has swelled with U.S. acquisitions.Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s 5.4 per cent increase in per-employee pay came after the company spent much of the early 2000s expanding in U.S. retail banking, with takeovers of Banknorth Group Inc. in Maine, Commerce Bancorp Inc. in New Jersey and South Financial Group Inc. to expand in Florida and the Carolinas. Those acquisitions helped fuel a 65 per cent expansion in Toronto-Dominion\u2019s workforce between 2007 and 2018.Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s business mix has much to do with a 7.1 per cent increase in per-employee compensation since 2007. Growth in wealth management and capital markets over the past decade at the country\u2019s largest lender has topped expansion at Canadian rivals, which have smaller operations in those areas. A drive to be a Top 10 investment bank in the U.S. also boosted pay, since capital-markets compensation is higher in the country than in Canada.Pay hasn\u2019t been an issue for all Canadian banks expanding abroad. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, for example, is seeing the benefits of taking over Cambodia\u2019s Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd., a process that began in 2014 with the purchase of a 10 per cent interest and grew into a 90 per cent controlling stake by 2016. National Bank\u2019s per-employee compensation dropped 20.5 per cent over 11 years.\u201cThe explanation is essentially the growth of the number of employees we\u2019ve had in Cambodia, where the average salary is significantly lower than the Canadian average,\u201d CEO Louis Vachon said in an interview. \u201cIn 2014, we had 600 employees in Cambodia, and by the end of this year we\u2019ll be over 5,000.\u201dNational Bank acquired the rest of ABA Bank in October. Employees in Cambodia, who now represent almost a quarter of the parent company\u2019s overall workforce, have an average annual compensation of around $10,000, compared with $110,000 for Canadian employees, according to the bank.At Bank of Nova Scotia, a 14 per cent decline in per-employee compensation came after the Toronto-based company boosted its employee base by two-thirds in the 11-year period. About 80 per cent of the additional workers are in international banking, in countries with lower wages than in Canada. Scotiabank has expanded with several Latin American acquisitions, including purchases in Chile, Peru and Colombia.\u201cOur footprint is what makes Scotiabank unique,\u201d spokesman Clancy Zeifman said, \u201cand more than half of our employees work outside of Canada.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "From taxes to housing to pipelines: How a Liberal or Conservative win could affect Canada\u2019s economy", "description": "Either way most individual Canadians will pay lower taxes, while corporations will pay a bit more", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/how-a-liberal-or-conservative-win-could-affect-canadas-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/election.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 21, 2019 11:07 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economic landscape is poised to see some minor changes after Monday\u2019s election, regardless of whether Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals or Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives take power, though the big picture drivers and challenges to growth will largely remain unchanged.Here\u2019s what will, and won\u2019t, likely change after the vote.Over the next couple of years, Canada is in store for more federal stimulus, regardless of the winner. This is due to the Liberal government\u2019s already budgeted spending increases which the parliamentary budget office projects will increase the deficit to $21 billion this year and $23 billion in 2020, from $14 billion in 2018.The Liberals are actually promising to add to that spending, and anticipate their deficits will jump to about $27 billion next year, exceeding 1 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2012. The Conservatives meanwhile will adhere to the current deficit projection through 2020.Beyond 2020, a key policy divide emerges on closing the budget gap. Trudeau plans to run deficits of more than $20 billion every year during a second mandate, increasing the projected debt by $32 billion over that time.The Conservatives argue this is an irresponsible approach, because it would cause future generations to pay for the increased public debt through higher taxes. They vow instead to close the budget gap within five years by cutting foreign aid and corporate handouts, as well as by expanding the time horizon for planned infrastructure spending, which would reduce the annual amount spent on large projects.Most individual Canadians will pay lower taxes, while corporations will pay a bit more. The most expensive campaign pledges for both parties are personal income tax cuts. The Liberals are pledging to raise the threshold under which no taxes are paid. The Conservatives plan to lower the rate of the lowest tax bracket. The cost for both is about $6 billion annually by 2023.While this is the main tax pledge for the Liberals, whose platform is more spend-heavy, the Conservatives are also planning a series of other tax cuts for households that will bring the total cost of their tax reductions to about $10 billion annually.Both parties, however, are planning to finance some of their measures by tapping corporate coffers. The Liberals plan to close corporate tax loopholes, while the Conservatives have pledged to cut corporate welfare \u2014 much of which comes in the form of tax credits. Both parties want to tax tech giants. These additional costs to corporations are marginal, and pale in comparisons to the higher corporate tax proposals made by the smaller left-leaning parties.The Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the carbon tax introduced by Trudeau\u2019s government earlier this year on holdout provinces with no carbon pricing. The Liberals plan to raise the minimum price provinces need to apply to greenhouse gas emissions to $50 a ton by 2022, from $20 a ton now, but the current program has considerable exemptions for large emitters. The Conservatives \u2014 who have adopted the same emission cut targets as the Liberals \u2014 want to shift the burden to large corporate emitters.Both main parties want to build the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which the Trudeau government bought last year for $4.5 billion after Kinder Morgan Inc. walked away. This project, anyhow, is out of the hands of politicians and in the hands of the courts.The bigger debate is whether the Trans Mountain pipeline \u2014 if it gets built at all \u2014 would be the country\u2019s last. The Conservatives claim the Liberals have put so many obstacles in the way of future development that no new energy infrastructure will ever be built, and have pledged to repeal tougher environmental and regulatory oversight while promoting an energy corridor across the country. The Liberals have shown little enthusiasm for new pipelines beyond Trans Mountain, and will face a major challenge even building that if they find themselves in a minority government needing the support of anti-pipeline parties.Residential real estate is one of the hottest topics of the campaign, with all major parties saying they\u2019ll make it easier for Canadians to buy a home. Liberals are pledging to make their first-time home buyer incentive program \u2014 in which a government agency chips in on the downpayment \u2014 more generous. The Conservatives are planning to extend the maximum mortgage amortization period to 30 years for first time buyers and change controversial lending rules \u2014 the so-called stress tests \u2014 introduced under the current government.The New Democratic Party, currently running third in the polls in terms of popular vote and which could play an important role in a minority government, is planning to create half a million affordable housing units and scrap the federal sales tax on construction of rental space.The surge of immigrants, along with temporary workers and international students, into the country has become a major driver of growth at a time when there are worries about the impact of high household debt levels and a global economic slowdown. The Liberals have announced a target to bring immigration to 350,000 by 2021, levels that haven\u2019t been hit in more than a century \u2014 which Scheer has indicated he will accept.Canada\u2019s small businesses can expect some relief no matter who wins. The Liberals are hoping to win back favour by promising to eliminate a double taxation on credit card transactions by doing away with \u201cswipe fees\u201d on sales taxes that merchants pay to credit card companies. This would save merchants around $500 million a year.The Conservatives are pledging to reverse Liberal tax changes for private corporations that outraged the small business community last year.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s real estate market seen in full recovery mode as sales and prices gain in September", "description": "Country's oil-producing regions the only ones showing any weakness", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-real-estate-market-is-in-full-recovery-mode", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 15, 2019 11:06 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s realtors produced another strong month of sales and prices in September, with gains in most major markets in a sign of strength for the nation\u2019s housing market.The number of units sold rose 0.6 per cent last month, extending a recent jump in activity that have seen transactions rise 16 per cent from a year ago, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday.

Now,\u00a0he and his staff help feed four times that. Before, the clientele was mostly folks struggling to pay rents that shot up during the oil boom. Today, it\u2019s often men and women who were living high before the bust. Sometimes, they pull up in shiny pickups purchased just a year or two ago.\u201cYou never know who\u2019s going to walk through your door,\u201d said Edwards, the food bank\u2019s director. \u201cIndividuals that have degrees and education and skills \u2014 but the jobs just aren\u2019t what they were.\u201dOnce the booming heart of the country\u2019s energy industry, the little city of 75,000 in northeastern Alberta has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing. Fat paycheques and generous overtime earlier this decade fuelled big spending on customized pickups and million-dollar homes. With work drying up, the bill has come due.Consumer insolvency filings in the Fort McMurray district climbed 39 per cent in 2018, the largest percentage increase in Canada, federal data show. Claims against property, the first step in the foreclosure process, surged almost tenfold over the past three years, according to court records. The city\u2019s 90-day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans climbed to 1.75 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.12 per cent nationally, according to Equifax Canada.The five-year slump that\u2019s cut oil prices in half since 2014 has been a driver in the bust. What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oilsands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oilsands as a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.Stewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada\u2019s federal election later this month. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and pledges to remove regulations Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.In May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s Fort Hills oilsands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.Richardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He\u2019d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.After the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he\u2019s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as cancelling his family\u2019s cable subscription.\u201cI spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,\u201d Richardson, 42, said. He\u2019s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. \u201cI never got into all the toys. I\u2019m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn\u2019t have to sell everything off like some other people. I\u2019ve seen a lot of that. It\u2019s like a fire sale.\u201dThe energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It\u2019s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.The potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oilsands are the world\u2019s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested $210.1 billion (US$157.7 billion), more than last year\u2019s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day. Canada shot up from the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest, overtaking Iran, Mexico and Norway.It was a heady time.Tax revenue and corporate sponsorships paid for a revamp of the Fort McMurray International Airport, improvements to schools, top-notch hockey facilities and a gleaming new recreation centre, where Carrie Underwood was a recent headliner.The city\u2019s population doubled as workers crowded in from around the country, sending rents and home prices surging and prompting a cascade of typical boomtown challenges, from crazy traffic to crowded schools. Companies, desperate for labour, threw six-figure salaries at low-skill jobs and covered commuting costs for roughnecks and people from as far away as Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast. Median annual household incomes more than doubled from 2001 to 2011, to about $181,000.Then oil prices tanked. The pipeline plans stalled. International giants, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sold off their major oilsands assets. Capital investments are on track to decline for a fifth straight year to an estimated $12 billion this year, about one-third of the 2014 level, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.Several operators \u2014 Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and a few others \u2014 are still active and generally profitable. But they\u2019ve managed that by cutting costs, including, of course, that of labour.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting the overtime that they used to get, or they\u2019re not getting any overtime at all,\u201d said Sandra Landry, an insolvency trustee at MNP Ltd.If things weren\u2019t bad enough when oil bottomed around US$26 a barrel in early 2016, the largest wildfire in recent history swept through the Fort Mac area that May. It forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses, making it the country\u2019s costliest natural disaster.\u201cThe housing market is down, there\u2019s the economic downturn and there\u2019s still the recovery from the fire,\u201d said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. Home prices remain 44 per cent below the recent peak.Sean O\u2019Byrne moved to Fort Mac from Grande Prairie, Alberta, after the fire to open a branch of a friend\u2019s siding business to repair damaged houses. That work dried up in November. Now he\u2019s selling cars, making far less than the $1,000 a day he could rake in with the siding business; customers at the General Motors dealership are no longer trading in for new models every two years. He and his wife have cut back on travel and moved to a cheaper apartment closer to their children\u2019s school, saving $900 in rent, he said while sipping coffee in a Tim Hortons doughnut shop facing a forested area, where charred trees stick out among new growth.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t spending money like they used to,\u201d he said.They likely won\u2019t be in the near future. There are only a few projects on the horizon that would create many new jobs. Teck Resources Ltd.\u2019s proposed $20-billion Frontier mine is in the early stages of the regulatory-approval process. Imperial Oil Ltd., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., has put its long-planned $2.6-billion Aspen mine on hold, waiting to see if the pipeline situation improves.There aren\u2019t many bets being laid that it will. More than a few folks would rather it not. Since the frenzy died down, traffic has returned to normal, in part because the oil money helped build a new bridge, over the Athabasca river. The unemployment rate, which skyrocketed to around 10 per cent in 2016, has settled down to 6.3 per cent mostly a function of workers decamping for more promising prospects.\u201cThat massive boom and gold-rush mentality that took place \u2014 I would rather not relive that,\u201d said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus, adding the entire industry has learned the benefits of measured growth.These days, the company will only consider expansion projects that will be profitable with the benchmark U.S. oil price at US$45 a barrel, about US$10 less than the current level. Some oilsands projects undertaken a decade ago required US$100 a barrel to break even.John Hickey is also content with the slowdown. A mechanic who works on used oil-industry vehicles, he lost his house in the wildfire. Two years ago, a builder quoted him $500,000. The offers keep moving down, and he\u2019s waiting for one to get to $200,000 or so before going ahead.In the meantime, he\u2019s sharing a one-bedroom condo with a friend, sleeping in a tent in the living room to give himself a bit of privacy. He still has work and has always lived within his means, a lesson for places like Fort Mac that can see the money go as quickly as it came, he said.Too many, he said, \u201cmade a lifestyle based on an economy that wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Election pledges risk re-igniting Canadian home prices, realtors warn", "description": "Even with no policy changes home prices to rise 1.5% in fourth quarter", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/election-pledges-risk-igniting-canadian-home-prices-realtors-warn", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 10, 2019 10:23 AM EDT", "content": "Candidates promising home-buyer incentives during Canada\u2019s election campaign risk igniting already lofty prices without tackling the critical issue of supply, a real estate firm warns.Even with consistent economic conditions and no new housing policy changes, home prices will rise by 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter to an aggregate $632,226 over the same period last year, according to a report Thursday by Royal LePage.\u201cWell-intentioned election promises aimed at making housing more accessible and affordable to first-time buyers will fall flat if they trigger a surge in demand without a corresponding increase in the supply of homes,\u201d Phil Soper, president and chief executive officer of Royal LePage, said in a statement.

Four years later, she\u2019s considering his rival.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the time that we have to go Conservative,\u201d Khoda said after attending a boisterous all-candidates debate at a community centre in Richmond Hill, Ontario, a city just north of Toronto. \u201cThe Liberals are going to lose seats.\u201dLike Ohio in the U.S., the sprawling suburbs around Toronto will likely dictate who will win the Oct. 21 election. After sweeping the diverse, immigrant-rich region four years ago, the Liberals are facing a difficult battle against Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer in the bellwether region known for its 905 area code.While polls tip Trudeau to win the most seats, his party is riding neck and neck with the Conservatives in the popular vote. If the Liberals sink to a minority government, or lose the election, chances are it will be because Trudeau lost support in this key area over his handling of foreign policy issues such as Iran and China, and the soaring cost of living.Khoda came to the evening debate seeking answers from Liberal incumbent Majid Jowhari on his position of resuming ties with Iran \u2014 a country she fled 33 years ago \u2014 even though she has made her choice. The Liberals\u2019 views on Iran, and \u201cupsetting\u201d efforts dealing with the U.S. on trade, led her to switch support to Conservative candidate Costas Menegakis.Others packing the gym suggest a close two-way battle between the Liberals and Conservatives in a riding pollsters say favours the incumbents.\u201cI think Majid Jowhari has a good chance,\u201d said Mohammad Mahmoudzadeh, 66, chairman of a local construction firm, though he no longer expects the Liberals to win a majority government.The Richmond Hill riding has about 110,000 people with a median total household income of $73,563 (US$55,245), similar to Ontario\u2019s provincial average. Three out of every five people here are immigrants, of which 72 per cent are from Asia \u2014 led by China, Iran and Hong Kong, according to the country\u2019s statistics agency. Almost two thirds of the population view themselves as \u201cfirst generation\u201d Canadians.Richmond Hill is one of 25 ridings in the 905 that includes the cities of Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan and Markham. They\u2019re family-oriented communities whose homeowners carry large mortgages, leaving little left over for spending elsewhere and often commute to Toronto for work, where lack of public transit is a perennial complaint.\u201cThis is a community that\u2019s been really hampered in its growth by the lack of a subway station,\u201d said Karen Mortfield, executive director of the Richmond Hill Board of Trade, which hosted the debate. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal.\u201dIn 2015, the Liberals captured all of Toronto\u2019s 25 ridings and all but three of the suburban districts, helping Trudeau win a majority government with 184 of the 338 seats in Parliament. But the seats often flip. In 2011, Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives captured most of the suburbs and parts of Toronto to gain a majority. The two regions together make up 50 seats, accounting for 15 per cent of the entire country.\u201cSince the early 1960s the suburban belt around Toronto has determined which party comes to power and whether it\u2019s going to be a majority or minority,\u201d Nelson Wiseman, a University of Toronto political science professor who specializes in Canadian politics, said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd in this election, the Liberals are going to sustain significant losses \u2014 they might lose half of those seats.\u201dWinning this region involves swinging votes by a couple percentage points and the Liberals are playing defence versus 2015, when Trudeau\u2019s \u201cSunny Ways\u201d mantra of hope appealed to Canadians wanting change after nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Wiseman said. He anticipates lower voter turnout this time, especially among younger Canadians, which favours the Conservatives since they tend to gain the older vote.The Liberals have 36 per cent support compared to 35 per cent for the Conservatives, while the New Democratic Party is third with 13 per cent, according to a Nanos Research survey published Wednesday by CTV News and the Globe and Mail. Seat projections compiled by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. put Trudeau on track to win in 153 districts, short of the 170 required for a majority.At Hillcrest Mall, one of Richmond Hill\u2019s biggest shopping centres, voters were divided. For Soroush Yousefi, 23, voting Conservative is a no-brainer even though he backed Trudeau four years earlier. Scheer\u2019s tax cuts and promises to boost the economy.\u201cBack then, a lot of the things Trudeau promised seemed better, but since he\u2019s been in power, everything has been going downhill,\u201d said Yousefi, a sales associate, who points to the lofty cost of housing. \u201cEverything just keeps getting more and more expensive and the jobs aren\u2019t paying enough to keep up with your expenses.\u201dA few stores away, employee Emma Hamilton said she\u2019s probably voting Liberal.\u201cI\u2019ve been working 40 hours the entire summer each week just to save up for school so my biggest concern is everybody\u2019s stance toward education and I don\u2019t like the direction the Conservatives are going,\u201d Hamilton, 20, said while closing shop after a late weeknight shift. \u201cI feel like Trudeau\u2019s all talk as well, so I\u2019d like to vote NDP, but they never win.\u201dNo one at the mall or community centre took issue with Trudeau\u2019s blackface controversy, photos of him in dark make up as a younger man, released earlier in the campaign.Even Richmond Hill\u2019s mayor wouldn\u2019t predict the outcome of the federal contest in his backyard during an Oct. 2 phone interview.\u201cIt\u2019ll be very close and it might end up being a party where the two governments have to work together,\u201d Mayor Dave Barrow said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Canada's housing market has come roaring back this fall, complete with black-tie condo launches", "description": "One real estate broker says he sold 30 condos in one weekend", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-housing-market-is-roaring-back-with-black-tie-condo-launches?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2019 2:31 PM EDT", "content": "More than a thousand brokers and agents sipped wine and nibbled ahi tuna hors d\u2019oeuvres at the black-tie sales launch of a luxury condominium in downtown Toronto last month.The 62-story proposed skyscraper in Yorkville, one of Canada\u2019s most exclusive neighbourhoods, features black marble kitchens with built-in wine troughs, an indoor-outdoor infinity pool and a piano lounge. Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million (US$1.48 million) for a 1,163 square foot three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000.\u201cThey\u2019re selling out like crazy,\u201d said Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. \u201cWe had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn\u2019t 100 per cent get what we wanted.\u201dA spokeswoman for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch.Canada\u2019s housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about US$10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent in September from last year.In contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012. Sales have also declined over the past two years.We're having the best back-to-back month since 2017New regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018. Those appear to have been largely absorbed \u2014 aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labour market. That\u2019s put housing affordability front and centre in the federal election campaign.\u201cI worked 90 hours in one week,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real-estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. \u201cThe pre-sale market is on fire again but resale has picked up too: We\u2019re having the best back-to-back month since 2017.\u201dCanada\u2019s population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto\u2019s booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city\u2019s many universities and colleges.Supply is lagging demand with even the International Monetary Fund this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home.\u201cThe demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,\u201d said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at Greybrook Capital, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. \u201cWhen you couple those together, that\u2019s an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it\u2019s rental or housing.\u201dBoth the Liberal and Conservative parties are promising to make home buying more affordable on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals.Though the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the RE/MAX broker, said.They really need to revisit that stress test \u2014 it's causing people a lot of stress\u201cNo one really knows what to expect: Who\u2019s going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules? Because they really need to revisit that stress test \u2014 it\u2019s causing people a lot of stress,\u201d Borg said.Prices in Calgary and Vancouver are still below recent records, down 5.9 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, according to Teranet-National Bank Home Price Indexes.Lofty home prices have pushed many prospective buyers into the rental market, where vacancy rates are at historically low levels and rents continue to rise.\u201cDespite purpose-built apartment construction rising four-fold since 2014, rental supply is unlikely to come close to demand in the coming years,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report last month. \u201cA deliberate policy to boost rental supply is needed \u2014 with specific targets and incentives to achieve them.\u201dThe bank estimates the number of renter households will jump by an average of 22,200 per year in Toronto. To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year.The federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what\u2019s needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "From housing prices to childcare to transit, Canadian voters are feeling tight on cash", "description": "Politicians are trying to turn financial anxiety into votes by promising tax cuts and other initiatives to make life more affordable", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/why-affordability-is-dominating-canadas-election-campaign", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wallet.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2019 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters.Though broad economic data show the nation\u2019s economy is humming along, Canadians are still feeling tight on cash. The worsening global outlook and unprecedented policy uncertainty are adding to the apprehension.Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with the leaders of smaller parties are seeking to parlay that stress into votes as the clock winds down on the Oct. 21 election, by promising a slew of tax cuts and other measures to make life more affordable for Canadians.\u201cPoliticians are putting their finger on something, some form of financial anxiety about rising costs, or concerns about future rising costs, or future standard of living,\u201d said Jennifer Robson, associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa.Here\u2019s why consumers are feeling pinched.It\u2019s old news that owning a home in Canada\u2019s biggest cities has become an almost impossible goal for much of the middle class. Skyrocketing prices in recent years pushed potential buyers to the sidelines. New mortgage lending rules, so-called stress tests introduced by federal regulators in 2017, put ownership even further out of reach for many.Toronto and Vancouver are easily Canada\u2019s two main cities where residents are struggling to find an affordable place to live. The average selling price for a single family home in Vancouver was $1.51 million (US$1.13 million) in September, and $1.1 million in Toronto. Renting in those cities is no easy feat either as low vacancy rates have pushed up prices for accommodation.Elevated real estate prices are the main driver of the country\u2019s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. Buyers took out larger and larger mortgages as the housing market heated up, even as incomes failed to keep pace. As a result, household savings rates are hovering near the lowest in decades and the debt service ratio \u2014 which measures the share of disposable income paid toward principal and interest \u2014 climbed to a record in the second quarter.While overall price inflation in Canada has been relatively benign, shoppers have experienced sticker shock on many basics. Prices for fruits and vegetables jumped as much as 60 per cent in the past decade, according to Statistics Canada. Childcare and tuition costs rose upwards of 35 per cent and public transit prices ballooned by 50 per cent.To top it all off, wages after accounting for inflation have remained relatively flat, even as costs for rent and basic goods increased. A puzzle for many economists and policy makers is why unemployment is hovering near record lows, yet incomes are struggling to pick up.The financial pressure on Canadians isn\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon, with the worldwide economic outlook dimming. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to 3.2 per cent. A rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009. Adding to the tension, many workers are worried about robots displacing jobs and the financial impact of an aging population.\u201cThat\u2019s the emotional side of this issue that doesn\u2019t show up in any CPI index or economic data,\u201d said David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus Data. \u201cIt\u2019s in the head and the parties are clearly recognizing that emotional side is important. It\u2019s like an arms race right now in Canada to offer up who can save us the most money.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Olga Kharif", "title": "Why an early Bitcoin millionaire says he's lost his 'love for the industry'", "description": "Jered Kenna got into the Bitcoin industry not to make money, but to change the world", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/why-an-early-bitcoin-millionaire-says-hes-lost-his-love-for-the-industry", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bitcoin2.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 3, 2019 11:18 AM EDT", "content": "As Bitcoin crashed 20 per cent in late September, Jered Kenna \u2014 one of the first Bitcoin millionaires \u2014 returned to Twitter after a three-year hiatus with a startling statement, saying he \u201clost the love for the industry.\u201dIn the early days, \u201call we talked about was things that actually had substance, and very few people were talking about making money,\u201d Kenna said in a phone interview last week from Texas, one of his home bases. \u201cAnd now the only thing people focus on is making money.\u201dKenna, who is 37, said he owns only half a Bitcoin, valued at about US$4,000. He used to hold thousands, initially bought for cents on the dollar, and headed TradeHill Inc. \u2014 the U.S.\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 handling a quarter of all global Bitcoin trades. He got into the industry not to make money, though, but to change the world, Kenna said \u2014 and has became disillusioned in recent years because instead of revolutionizing payments and challenging the banking system, crypto became all about speculation.Hearing an ad on his car radio several years ago, encouraging people to mortgage their homes to buy Bitcoin, took him aback. The Initial Coin Offerings craze of 2017, in which startups raised billions by selling digital coins mostly to retail investors, and then often disappearing with the funds, or not delivering any real products, was another blow. More recently, exchange-based coin offerings have taken centre stage \u2014 many of them likely as bad, he said.Many of his old crypto friends feel the same way, Kenna said, though few are getting out since they are still practically minting money. Then there\u2019s also the prestige.\u201cI was in Miami last week and I went to a crypto event, and it was full of beautiful models looking for men,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, this has changed,\u201d recalling gatherings full of tech geeks years ago. He is not crypto\u2019s only defector: Roger Ver, known as Bitcoin Jesus for proselyting about the digital coin, now speaks against it and had split off to create a rival token.Many of the old-timers had \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d about Bitcoin, and didn\u2019t like it getting commercialized, said Nic Carter, co-founder of crypto tracker Coin Metrics. \u201cLots of the early Utopian builders naturally got disillusioned,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s to be expected.\u201d He calls the departed, \u201cso many lost souls.\u201dKenna has gotten out partly involuntarily: He accidentally erased 800 Bitcoins (valued at about US$6.5 million now) from his computer in 2010, and then lost millions of dollars\u2019 worth to a hack in 2016. He has since chosen to rebuild his life outside of the crypto world, creating what he said is the largest independent craft brewer in Colombia, and building out a co-living tech space in San Francisco \u2014 built from the ashes of his crypto wealth.Back in 2016, right before he was hacked, Kenna sold half his crypto, and invested the money into a small brewery in Colombia, where he went thanks to a Colombian girlfriend who wanted to move home.\u201cWe split up after a while, and I decided to stay and open the brewery,\u201d he said. 20Mission Cerveza \u2014 which looks like your typical upscale pub, with lots of unfinished wood, a stage for a blues band and giant chandeliers \u2014- is also now making tonic and ginger beer. The brewery\u2019s website is in Spanish, except for its slogan, \u201cstay classy.\u201d Kenna is now raising money to expand the business, and wants to start importing the beer to the U.S.Back in 2012, he also bought a building in San Francisco for US$2 million using his crypto wealth, and turned it into the 20Mission co-living space for techies and artists. There are 41 bedrooms and shared bathrooms and kitchen. Kenna is considering buying a 144,000-square-foot middle school near Boston to convert that building into a similar co-living space, with 400 rooms and a tech incubator.Kenna has been mostly out of crypto since 2016, when he said a hacker purchased a phone in his name. The hacker then changed his email passwords, took over some 60 accounts and stole millions, he said. Kenna was so stressed out, he said he had to go to a hospital, and has been on blood-pressure medication since.\u201cThe hack took my entire life,\u201d Kenna said. Just then, he was getting ready to relaunch a new crypto exchange, an effort that the hack derailed. Started in 2011, TradeHill closed its doors in 2012, citing a need to get money-transmitter licenses and because of difficulty of finding a bank willing to work with it, among a host of reasons, he said.In addition to his half a Bitcoin, Kenna said he owns a few thousand XRPs and a stash of a lesser known coin, which he invested in two years ago. He doesn\u2019t think crypto will disappear altogether.\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s 90 per cent speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, casinos are 100 per cent speculation and they are still around.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home prices jump most in 21 months, bringing $805,500 benchmark close to record", "description": "Sales surge 22%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-posts-biggest-price-gain-in-21-months", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 3, 2019 8:34 AM EDT", "content": "The Toronto housing market continued to rebound in September, with prices rising the most in 21 months, bringing the cost of a typical home close to the record high set in 2017.The benchmark price across all types of homes rose 5.2 per cent from a year earlier to $805,500, the highest annual rate of growth since December 2017.

Principal and compound interest don\u2019t have to be paid back until you sell the home or die. To keep the loan in good standing, homeowners only need to pay property tax and insurance, and maintain the home in good repair.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been in this market for 18 months, but applications are jumping,\u201d and have tripled over the past year, Andrew Moor, chief executive officer at Equitable Group Inc., said in an interview. The company, which operates Equitable Bank, sees the reverse mortgage sector expanding by about 25 per cent a year. \u201cCanadians are getting older and there is an opportunity there.\u201dOutstanding balances on reverse mortgages have more than doubled in less than four years to $3.12 billion (US$2.37 billion), excluding foreign currency amounts, according to June data from the country\u2019s banking regulator. Although they represent less than one percentage point of the $1.2 trillion of residential mortgages issued by chartered banks, they\u2019re growing at a much faster pace. Reverse mortgages rose 22 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier, versus 4.8 per cent for the total market.The fact that these niche products are growing so quickly offers a glimpse into how some seniors are becoming part of Canada\u2019s new debt reality. After a decades-long housing boom, the nation has the highest household debt load in the Group of Seven, one reason Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz may be reluctant to join the global monetary-policy easing trend.More seniors are entering retirement with debt and the cost of rent has shot up in many cities, making downsizing difficult amid hot real estate markets. Reverse mortgages offer a new source of income.Canada\u2019s big five banks have so far shied away from the product. Only two lenders offer them in Canada. HomeEquity Bank, whose reverse mortgage has been on the market for 30 years, dominates the space with $3.11 billion on its books. Equitable Bank, a relatively new player, has $10.1 million. Shares in parent Equitable Group have surged 75 per cent to a record this year.Critics say reverse mortgages are a high-cost solution that should only be used as a last resort.\u201cWhen they think of their cash flow, they\u2019re not going to get kicked out of their house, but in reality, it really has the ability to erode the asset of the borrower,\u201d Shawn Stillman, a broker at Mortgage Outlet, said by phone from Toronto.Interest rates are typically much higher than those for conventional mortgages. For example, HomeEquity Bank and Equitable Bank charge 5.74 per cent for a five-year fixed mortgage. Conventional five-year fixed mortgages are currently being offered online for as low as 2.4 per cent.Atul Chandra, chief financial officer at HomeEquity Bank, said the higher rates are justified because the lender doesn\u2019t receive any payments over the course of the loan.\u201cOur time horizon for getting the cash is much longer, and generally the longer you wait for your cash to come back to you, the more you need to charge,\u201d Chandra said in a telephone interview.Executives at HomeEquity Bank and Equitable say they are focusing on educating people about reverse mortgages to avoid mistakes that were made in the U.S. during the housing crisis \u2014 including aggressive sales tactics.While delinquency rates on regular mortgages are still low for seniors, they were the highest among all age groups in the first quarter, at 0.36 per cent, according to data from the federal housing agency. The 65-plus demographic took over as the most delinquent group at the end of 2015. For non-mortgage debt, delinquency rates in the 65-plus category have seen the biggest increases over the past several quarters, Equifax data show.Reverse mortgages aren\u2019t included in typical delinquency rate measures \u2014 borrowers can\u2019t be late on payments because there are no payments \u2014 but they can be in default if they fail to pay taxes or insurance, or let the home fall into disrepair. However default rates for reverse mortgages have remained stable, even with the strong growth in volumes, said HomeEquity\u2019s Chandra.According to a scenario provided by HomeEquity Bank, a borrower who took out a reverse mortgage of $150,000 at an interest rate of 5.74 per cent would owe $199,058 five years later. A home worth $750,000 when the reverse mortgage was taken out would be worth $869,456 five years later, assuming 3 per cent annual home price appreciation, meaning total equity would have grown by about $70,000.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "CIBC may have gone too far with its mortgage retreat, CEO says", "description": "CEO Victor Dodig says the bank 'put the brakes on too hard, and we're re-adjusting for that'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/cibc-may-have-gone-too-far-with-its-mortgage-retreat-ceo-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cibc.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 4, 2019 1:10 PM EDT", "content": "The head of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce admits the lender may have retreated too far from the domestic mortgage market.\u201cCandidly, I think we went too far left in slowing things down, put the brakes on too hard, and we\u2019re re-adjusting for that,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said Wednesday at the Scotiabank Financials Summit in Toronto. \u201cWe are now looking to create a more robust presence in the mortgage landscape.\u201dCIBC had trounced its peers with 12 per cent year-over-year gains in mortgage growth through the first three quarters of 2017 \u2014 until the pendulum began to swing the other way.

His efforts may be of little help to people in the country\u2019s priciest cities.The national housing agency aims to spend up to $1.25 billion over three years subsidizing down payments for new lower- to middle-income buyers. Under the program, launched Monday, the government will pay up to 10 per cent of the purchase price in exchange for a stake in the home that would be paid back once it\u2019s sold.The plan targets millennials, a growing cohort that\u2019s getting squeezed out of Canada\u2019s housing market. Home prices across the country jumped almost 40 per cent in the five years through July, largely driven by gains in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. Trudeau\u2019s government expects the program will be used by 100,000 buyers, but brokers and analysts are skeptical that it will have much traction in the areas that need it most.\u201cIt\u2019s a very narrowly-focused program,\u201d Royal LePage President Phil Soper said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a big enough slot of the market to move it.\u201dWhile there are people who will benefit, the initiative is unlikely to help those looking in Toronto or Vancouver, where the average price of a home in July was $826,165 and $982,427, respectively.The program is available to buyers with annual household earnings of $120,000 or less, and the mortgage-to-income ratio can\u2019t be more than four times the household income. Under those conditions, the maximum purchase price allowed is about $565,000.That puts markets such as Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, Greater Vancouver and Victoria out of reach of the average buyer, according to real estate website Zoocasa. Cities where home-shoppers would have more luck include Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, Zoocasa said.The program, called the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, also will encourage construction to help ease the country\u2019s housing-supply shortage, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.\u201cDespite the income and borrowing limits, we are confident this program can work in all markets, including Vancouver and Toronto,\u201d Audrey-Anne Coulombe, a spokeswoman for CMHC, said in an email. The average prices in those cities \u201care not the same as starter-home prices. In the first quarter, 32 per cent of units sold in Toronto and 20 per cent in Vancouver were under $499,000.\u201dStill, the effort may result in fewer than 5,000 purchases a year, according to a report by Mortgage Professionals Canada. Buyers\u2019 resistance to give up equity in their homes and the requirement for mortgage insurance will be a substantial impediment, said Will Dunning, chief economist for the group.\u201cThe government says it wants to make homeownership more affordable and accessible, but its actions say otherwise,\u201d he said.

German and Italian benchmarks also sank to levels never seen before.There was a striking difference between this yield-suppressing rally and Friday\u2019s: U.S. stocks are climbing Wednesday, but the S&P 500 suffered one of its worst losses of the year at the end of last week.

U.S. yields have been tumbling since the fourth quarter. The 30-year Treasury yielded as much as 3.46 per cent in November. But the move picked up steam after the Federal Reserve\u2019s July 31 rate decision, when the central bank disappointed many investors by not signalling a dramatic easing of monetary policy. The escalation of the U.S.-China trade war didn\u2019t help. The 30-year yield has sunk 59 basis points in August, the steepest monthly decline since 2011.As concerns grow over a global economic slowdown, the U.S. yield curve is sending an even louder recession signal. Two-year Treasuries yielded as much as 6.6 basis points more than the 10-year on Wednesday, the most deeply inverted this part of the curve has been since 2007.Strategists as BMO Capital Markets said in a note Wednesday that there remains \u201cample\u201d room for 30-year Treasury rates to move lower. \u201cThe momentum of buying can continue and has continued, even though there hasn\u2019t been a big buying catalyst,\u201d BMO\u2019s Ben Jeffery said in a phone interview. \u201cPeople still want to lock in yields even though they are lower.\u201dA practice known as convexity hedging, which has acted as a factor in depressing rates throughout the year, may also add fuel to the bond rally. When yields fall, the change in rates affects the duration of investors\u2019 portfolios, and two sets of traders \u2014 those who buy mortgage bonds and those who use derivatives to bet on market stability \u2014 are acutely sensitive. To staunch losses, they often turn to interest-rate swaps, which in turn pushes Treasury yields down even more.Evidence shows the technical phenomenon is still alive and well. While yields on 30-year Treasuries dropped as low as 1.90 per cent on Wednesday, the rate on similar-maturity swaps got to 1.50 per cent. The 30-year swap spread \u2014 as the gap between the two measures is known \u2014 sits near a two-year low.Although investors in mortgage-backed securities might not be to blame for the latest moves, \u201cother hedging flows are a major driver,\u201d Cloherty said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Lananh Nguyen and Alexandra Harris", "title": "'An international, complex intellectual challenge': Wall Street prepares\u00a0for the end of the Libor era", "description": "The benchmark underpins US$350 trillion of mortgages, loans and derivatives across various currencies, and employees are scrambling to manage its demise", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/an-international-complex-intellectual-challenge-wall-street-prepares-for-the-end-of-the-libor-era", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/libor4.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 27, 2019 10:52 AM EDT", "content": "Libor is dying, warn global regulators, and there\u2019s nothing banks can do to stop it.Their only choice is to prepare for the end.That\u2019s where Jason Granet comes in. Plucked from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s asset-management unit last year, he now leads a group of bankers and lawyers working day in and day out to ready the lender for the fateful day \u2014 still more than two years away \u2014 when the world\u2019s most important reference rate is set to be phased out.The major Wall Street banks \u2014 not to mention insurers, money managers, law firms and advisory businesses \u2014 are all mobilizing employees around the globe in anticipation of Libor\u2019s demise. The benchmark\u2019s key role in financial markets \u2014 at last count it underpins more than US$350 trillion of mortgages, loans and derivatives across various currencies \u2014 means they\u2019re being pulled from all corners of the industry. For Granet, the objective is clear: ensure that what many say is one of the most significant and complex transitions in the history of modern finance goes off without a hitch at Goldman Sachs.\u201cMy job completely changed,\u201d said Granet, who now reports to Beth Hammack in treasury operations after spending the bulk of his almost 20-year career at the bank overseeing money-market funds. \u201cIt\u2019s an international, complex intellectual challenge.\u201dFor decades, the London interbank offered rate was a convenient way to determine the cost of floating-rate debt around the world. It\u2019s calculated from a daily survey of more than 15 large banks that estimate the price to borrow from each other without putting up collateral.But the trading behind those estimates has dried up, and coupled with the post-crisis discovery of rampant manipulation, U.K. officials two years ago signalled an end to Libor, saying they\u2019ll stop compelling banks to submit quotes after 2021.The decision has spurred global regulators to push ahead with their own domestic funding-rate alternatives, and forced financial firms to figure how to extricate themselves from a benchmark so thoroughly entwined in global markets.At a June roundtable, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and others discussed how they\u2019re establishing oversight committees, setting up joint steering groups and recruiting employees to build out their Libor transition capabilities. Consulting companies such as Oliver Wyman & Co. and Accenture Plc are advising clients on how to best manage the shift, while law firms such as Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft have helped craft fallback language for credit contracts that reference the benchmark.When Wells Fargo\u2019s Brian Grabenstein became the head of the lender\u2019s Libor transition office last year, he quickly realized that he needed to staff up. He now has a team of a dozen people coordinating meetings with the consumer banking and wealth management groups, among others, and running committees focused on various aspects of the transition \u2014 from legal documentation to communications.He estimates that 200 people at the bank have worked at least 10 hours on Libor over the past month.\u201cUp until not that long ago, this was not on a lot of people\u2019s radar,\u201d Grabenstein said. \u201cI quickly realized it wasn\u2019t just one person\u2019s full-time role, but in fact it was going to be a number of peoples\u2019 full time jobs.\u201dAlong with colleague Readie Callahan, who heads communications strategy for the transition team, the pair have crisscrossed the U.S. in recent months, speaking with groups of as many as 50 corporate customers at a time about the shift. Wells Fargo is still working on its strategy to inform retail customers about the change, which will impact products such as adjustable-rate mortgages.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing appreciation for how much work there is to be done,\u201d Grabenstein said.It\u2019s not just banks affected by Libor\u2019s end. MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer, faces exposure through its US$587 billion investment management portfolio. It tapped Jason Manske, head of global derivatives and liquid markets, as transition point man.The firm was an early adopter of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate \u2014 a new benchmark developed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a potential Libor replacement \u2014 via its primary market issuance. It\u2019s priced US$2.5 billion of SOFR-linked notes since the reference rate\u2019s debut early last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Still, industry veterans are growing concerned about potential risks to financial stability in the coming years, given the broader market\u2019s slow embrace of products based on alternative benchmarks. Many say the change is comparable in scope to the adoption of the Dodd-Frank reforms following the 2008 financial crisis, while others liken the situation to Y2K, which presented significant operational challenges to Wall Street even if it ultimately proved benign.Manske, who is a member of the New York Fed\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee designed to smooth the shift to SOFR (pronounced \u2018So-fur\u2019), compares the transition\u2019s impact on financial markets to the adoption of the euro two decades ago.\u201cThe euro was dealing with a spot FX rate, forwards and options markets,\u201d Manske said. \u201cThis is cross-border, secured versus unsecured, credit spread versus no credit spread, cash and derivatives markets. It\u2019s definitely more complicated than most things the market has done.\u201dFor Goldman Sachs\u2019s Granet, who grew up doing jigsaws, it\u2019s one of the largest, most challenging puzzles he\u2019s ever faced. Along with his four-person team and a dedicated group of lawyers, he\u2019s been focusing in recent months on reviewing portfolio exposure, rewriting contracts and retooling trading systems to incorporate Libor\u2019s anticipated replacements.The scale of the task means \u201cliterally every part of the firm is involved,\u201d Granet said. \u201cTaking a step back, it\u2019s a pretty foundational change to a lot of things that are going on now\u201d in global finance.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "CIBC shares surge on profit beat in U.S. unit", "description": "Shares surged the most in more than 20 months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/cibc-profit-beats-on-strength-in-retail-commercial-banking-units", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/cibc-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 22, 2019 10:23 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\u2019s shares surged after third-quarter results showed its U.S. operations and higher revenue lifted profit above analysts\u2019 estimates.The company\u2019s commercial-banking and wealth-management division in the U.S., which includes the PrivateBank operations CIBC acquired two years ago, was the quarter\u2019s best-performer, with a profit jump of 6.2 per cent. Earnings from Canadian personal and small-business banking, the largest division, climbed less than half as much.\u201cThe company\u2019s U.S. segment continues to drive above-average growth,\u201d Scott Chan, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note to clients.Shares of the company surged the most in more than 20 months after the report, which showed overall profit rising 2.1 per cent. Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig told investors in May that earnings this year would be \u201crelatively flat\u201d partly due to higher spending. The positive results out of the U.S. helped counter a 13 per cent decline in CIBC\u2019s capital-markets business and a 1 per cent drop in Canadian commercial banking and wealth management.\u201cOur commercial banks continue to perform exceptionally well,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said in a phone interview. \u201cTheir loan and deposit growth is very strong and they continue to be very well managed.\u201dProfit at Canada\u2019s fifth-largest lender was $1.4 billion (US$1.1 billion) for the period ended July 31, with adjusted earnings of $3.10 a share, the Toronto-based lender said Thursday in a statement, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by four cents. CIBC raised its quarterly dividend 2.9 per cent to $1.44 a share. Shares of the bank rose as much as 3.3 per cent to $102.74 in trading in Toronto.Still, CIBC saw continued weakness in its domestic mortgages and rising loan-loss provisions even as larger rival Royal Bank of Canada posted improvements in those areas for the three-month period.CIBC once had enviable mortgage growth, trouncing other banks with 12 per cent year-over-year gains through 2017 \u2014 until the pendulum started to swing the other way at the end of last year. The domestic mortgage book contracted for the third straight quarter with C$201 billion in balances, down 1% from a year earlier.Investors and analysts have been watching for signs of deteriorating loans since short sellers earlier this year said that CIBC and other banks are ill-prepared for worsening credit conditions. CIBC set aside $291 million for soured loans in the quarter, up from C$255 million in the previous three months and 21 per cent more than a year earlier \u2014 and higher than analysts expected.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our portfolios and think that they\u2019re performing extremely well,\u201d Glass said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing from a systemic basis that gives us pause.\u201dJames Shanahan, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said he sees \u201cbroader concerns\u201d about credit quality. \u201cElevated credit costs and increased impairments in the business-loan portfolio are more concerning and offset what is a modest beat,\u201d Shanahan said in an interview.CIBC defied analysts\u2019 pessimistic expectations quarter after quarter for almost four years, until missing estimates in the fourth quarter of 2018 \u2014 and subsequent periods since. CIBC broke that streak in the quarter ended July 31.Net interest income was $2.69 billion, up 4.5 per cent and rebounding from a slowdown earlier in the year.The bank also announced that CFO Glass will step down Oct. 31 to be replaced by Hratch Panossian, currently executive vice president, global controller and investor relations.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Royal Bank of Canada profit misses on weak equity trading", "description": "RBC had $653 million in profit from RBC Capital Markets, a 6.4 per cent decline", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/royal-bank-of-canada-profit-misses-on-weak-equity-trading", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/rbc-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 21, 2019 10:21 AM EDT", "content": "Royal Bank of Canada posted fiscal third-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, hurt by a slowdown in the company\u2019s capital-markets division.Canada\u2019s largest lender by assets had $653 million (US$491 million) in profit from RBC Capital Markets, a 6.4 per cent decline, the result of lower trading revenue and a drop in investment-banking fees, according to a statement Wednesday. Earnings from RBC Investor & Treasury Services also fell, sinking 24 per cent, countering record profits in Canadian banking and wealth management.Canadian banks have been facing a slowdown in domestic investment banking, with fewer equity financings and corporate bond sales along with lower acquisition activity crimping revenue in their capital-markets divisions. Low market volatility and declining interest rates, meanwhile, put additional pressure on results.Royal Bank had \u201ca modest miss against expectations as the macro environment weighed on its Capital Markets results as well as those from its Investor & Treasury Services operations,\u201d Barclays Plc bank analyst John Aiken said in a note to clients. \u201cDespite the miss, the results from its other segments were solid.\u201dAcross the Toronto-based bank, net income for the period ended July 31 rose 5 per cent from a year earlier, with adjusted per-share earnings of $2.26 missing the $2.30 average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\u201cOn the markets-related side, when clients are choosing to do less activity, that will follow through with lower results for us, and that\u2019s natural,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said in a phone interview. \u201cSo as client activity picks up, as we move into the fall, perhaps our results will pick up as well.\u201dRoyal Bank is the first of the large Canadian lenders to report quarterly results, and Canada\u2019s six biggest lenders are expected to post earnings growth of 5% for the quarter, the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Royal Bank is one of Canada\u2019s most diversified banks, including worldwide operations in asset management and capital markets and ownership of Los Angeles-based commercial and private lender City National Bank. Yet Canadian personal-and-commercial banking remains the company\u2019s biggest division. The operation posted a 7.9 per cent jump in earnings to a record $1.61 billion, representing almost half of overall profit at the bank. Wealth-management earnings rose 11 per cent to $639 million.The Toronto-based lender saw improvements in two areas of concern for investors and analysts: expenses and provisions. Growth in non-interest expenses cooled after three quarters of accelerated growth as the bank invested in technology and spent more on hiring, marketing and new initiatives. Still, costs reached a record $5.99 billion, up 2.3 per cent from a year earlier.\u201cAs the revenue headwinds might be picking up, given the interest rate outlook, we saw that we needed to slow that rate of growth,\u201d Bolger said. \u201cWe expect to continue to grow expenses, albeit at a much slower rate than what we\u2019ve been growing over the last couple years.\u201dRoyal Bank has been facing elevated levels of provisions and impaired loans this year, notably in its wholesale lending portfolio in areas such as the U.S. oil-and-gas industry. In the third quarter, the bank set aside $425 million, little changed from the previous quarter and up 20 per cent from a year earlier.Royal Bank\u2019s shares were little changed at $99.44 at 9:51 a.m. in Toronto. The stock has risen 6.4 per cent this year, outperforming the 4.4 per cent gain for the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Separately, Royal Bank said that Doug McGregor, group head of RBC Capital Markets and RBC Investor & Treasury Services, will retire on Jan. 31 after 37 years at the bank. Derek Neldner, global head of investment banking at RBC Capital Markets, will become group head of capital markets effective Nov. 1, while Doug Guzman, who oversees wealth management and insurance, will take over Investor & Treasury Services.Other takeaways from the bank\u2019s quarterly results:The company routinely expands mortgage balances by about 5 per cent each quarter, topping growth at its rivals. Domestic mortgage balances rose 5.9 per cent to $257.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter.Most Canadian banks increase their quarterly dividends twice a year. Royal Bank stuck to that tradition, boosting its payout 2.9 per cent to $1.05.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "A Bank of Canada rate cut is looking more likely and the first could come as early as September", "description": "A slowing economy and growing trade tensions suggest a cut will happen more quickly than currently accounted for, Macquarie economist says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/a-bank-of-canada-rate-cut-is-looking-more-likely-and-the-first-could-come-as-early-as-september?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bank-of-canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 20, 2019 9:23 AM EDT", "content": "More economists are coming around to the view the Bank of Canada will have to cut rates this year, with a move as early as September looking increasingly possible.A slowing Canadian economy, along with a deterioration in global demand and growing trade tensions, suggest a downward move from the central bank is likely to happen more quickly than currently accounted for, according to David Doyle, an economist at Macquarie Capital Markets in Toronto.Implied odds show investors are assigning only a 20 per cent chance of a cut at the central bank\u2019s next decision on Sept. 4. One rate cut by December is fully priced, as is one more cut by June next year. That may not be quick enough, especially with the country\u2019s yield curve inverting to the point that historically has presaged central bank easing, Doyle said.\u201cIn the event that we are heading into a global recession and things turn ugly and you get rising unemployment rates globally, then Canada is going to have to ease, maybe even more than the U.S.,\u201d Doyle said in a telephone interview.Macquarie is assigning a more than 50 per cent chance of a cut in September, plus another cut in October.Scotiabank also revised its rate outlook last Friday, predicting one rate cut this year from the Bank of Canada no later than at its Oct. 30 decision, and as early as Sept. 4. A second cut would come early in 2020. It based the revision on the view the U.S.-China trade war will persist through Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cRisks to the Canadian economy are on the rise,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, Scotiabank\u2019s chief economist, said in a note to clients. \u201cDependent as it is on international trade, Canada cannot be immune to the rising tide of protectionism.\u201dPerrault is more sanguine about the domestic outlook than Doyle. He believes Canadian economic conditions don\u2019t warrant rate cuts, but the heightened global uncertainty requires a cautious tone.\u201cWe now believe the Bank of Canada will follow those that cut rates to insure against potential damage,\u201d Perrault said.Economists and markets have been expecting fewer moves, and a slower pace of cutting from Canada, for a number of reasons. The nation\u2019s economy probably grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms, unlike the U.S., and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank\u2019s target.Risks to the Canadian economy are on the riseBut historically it\u2019s also rare for Canada to be so out of sync with the Fed, which has already cut its policy rate once and is seen moving again three more times over the next six months.As of Aug. 16, implied odds based on cash forward rates show investors are pricing in 37 basis points of easing over the next six months for the Bank of Canada, versus 81 points for the Fed. The discrepancy in expectations for Canadian and U.S. policy moves has been averaging the widest since 2010.Regardless, Doyle expects the domestic economic data to make a turn for the worse in the next few months. Inflation pressures are likely to moderate, particularly as mortgage costs fall, business investment looks uncertain, and inventories have built up to recession-era levels, all of which point to a softer second half for the Canadian economy, Doyle said in a recent research report.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Robo adviser Wealthsimple targets Canada\u2019s richest families with Grayhawk partnership", "description": "Partnership allows Wealthsimple to offer Grayhawk strategies to advisers with wealthy clients on its platform", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/wealthsimple-targets-canadas-richest-with-grayhawk-partnership?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/katchen.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 15, 2019 2:18 PM EDT", "content": "Wealthsimple Inc., the robo adviser favoured by millennials, is expanding in the opposite end of the Canadian wealth spectrum \u2014 services for high-net worth families.The investment firm\u2019s Wealthsimple to Advisors unit will provide technology, dealer and advisory services to Grayhawk Investment Strategies Inc., a Calgary-based firm that manages about $800 million (US$600 million) for 30 of Canada\u2019s richest families.

Each of the big five banks have at least one, including Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s shiny gold building, and Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s monolith black slabs. But new buildings offering more open and eco-friendly spaces that cater to the growing cohort of millennial workers are springing up.They include a 46-story building being developed by Cadillac Fairview Corp, and one pitched by Oxford Properties Group which would be of Canada\u2019s biggest mixed-use projects.Still, office vacancy rates in city\u2019s downtown remain the lowest in North America driven by a tech and financial-services boom. Daal said Toronto is likely in the middle of its office-building cycle with strong growth ahead.Vancouver-based QuadReal plans to take down the South and East towers of the 2 million square foot Commerce Court complex, which together have 18 floors. Those were part of a three-building addition in the 1970s designed by architect I.M. Pei.The original Commerce Court North, which houses the headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, was built in 1931. It includes a vaulted gold-coffered ceiling and classic Art-Deco design and will be incorporated into the makeover.The plan is in early stages and still needs city approval.

His comments come as industry groups push federal officials to revisit lending rules that were introduced last year, contributing to a rapidly cooling market and making it harder for first-time buyers to purchase homes. Some argue the country\u2019s banking regulator should ease up on stress tests requiring homebuyers to show they can handle payments 200 basis points higher than the contracted rate.\u201cIt\u2019s taken a number of buyers out of the market temporarily as they build a greater down payment for that mortgage, it\u2019s cooled housing prices, but it\u2019s all about balancing supply demand and, like every policy, it\u2019s not static,\u201d said McKay, whose company is Canada\u2019s largest mortgage lender. \u201cMaybe you have to re-look at parts of it and tweak it.\u201dAlso in the interview, McKay said he sees a fairly low chance of significant interest-rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to make one of its own. Canada\u2019s currency should remain in the range of 76.92 US cents, a level at which the country would remain competitive, he said.\u201cIf the U.S. starts cutting, and the rate differential starts closing, we\u2019ll see pressure on a strengthening Canadian dollar,\u201d McKay said. \u201cBut that\u2019s offset by slower oil, gas sales, slower export sales.

His came in the form of a \u201969 Chevy Camaro.Back when the retired defenceman was a rookie in 2003, he was wowed by a muscle car owned by a Colorado Avalanche teammate. Liles vowed that if he ever landed a big National Hockey League contract, he\u2019d build the same custom Camaro. Five years later, the Indiana native signed a four-year deal with the Avalanche \u2014 then proceeded to fritter away US$100,000 on a yellow convertible with black racing stripes.\u201cI probably spent more money on it than I realistically should have,\u201d Liles, 38, said in a phone interview from his home outside Vail, Colo. \u201cIt was a great car and I loved it, but at some point I had to become an adult. I have two kids and it\u2019s not exactly child-friendly.\u201dTo help him avoid bigger lures and protect 14 years of NHL earnings, Liles said he has relied on Royal Bank of Canada.The firm was earlier than most in specifically targeting hockey players as clients and thinks it can replicate that success with other athletes. As its hometown Toronto Raptors celebrate breaking Canada\u2019s 26-year championship drought in the biggest North American sports, RBC sees an opportunity.It has plenty of competition from major banks trying to ride the wave of surging salaries in professional sports. Morgan Stanley established a Global Sports & Entertainment division almost five years ago, and now has 132 directors and associates in the group. Goldman Sachs made a similar move last July, setting up a Sports and Entertainment Solutions business in its private-wealth-management division.\u201cWe have longstanding relationships with clients who are within the sports and entertainment industry, going back decades. Within the past year, we decided to have a more dedicated presence,\u201d Nicole Pullen Ross, who oversees the business at Goldman, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely fortunate to have some very early success.\u201dIt\u2019s not just banks. Smaller companies, independent money managers and boutique firms are clamouring for some of the action in a business with mammoth contracts and sponsorship deals. Financial adviser Chris Moynes, who spent a decade in Royal Bank\u2019s sports division before becoming managing director of One Sports + Entertainment Group, handles about 75 NHL players. Even former athletes have made the leap. The latest example: Tony Parker, a four-time National Basketball Association champion who retired from playing last week, joined NorthRock Partners\u2019 sports, artists and entertainment division.The biggest firms are on the hunt for sports clients eager to avoid getting burned in a world rife with financial mismanagement. Professional athletes alleged almost US$600 million in fraud-related losses from 2004 through 2018, Ernst & Young said in a report.And there\u2019s plenty of money to be taken: Multiple baseball stars signed contracts this year paying more than US$300 million, and a dozen NBA players may score nine-figure deals this summer. Athlete salaries in the NHL, National Football League, NBA and Major League Baseball ranged from US$2.7 million to US$7.1 million in 2017, according to the EY report. Endorsements and sponsorship deals brought in US$887 million for the top 100 earners.In serving those highly paid athletes, Royal Bank stands out, having advised pros for almost three decades. It focused initially on hockey players, whose careers often shuttle them between the U.S. and Canada.\u201cNobody has our cross-border capabilities,\u201d Bob McKee, Royal Bank\u2019s managing director for sports professionals, said in an interview at his Vancouver office. \u201cThat is the key.\u201dIt's not a 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday job. You've got to be able to work 24/7, seven days a week. It's not a job for everybody.The company works with about 900 sports professionals, about 80 per cent tied to hockey \u2014 mostly NHL players, but also those playing in the American Hockey League or Europe, as well as drafted junior players, retired NHLers, coaches, agents and executives. The rest are in MLB or the NFL, where Royal Bank expanded in the past two years, or in the NBA or professional golf.A 38-member Royal Bank team includes a dozen private bankers in Canada and the U.S. who act as \u201cquarterbacks,\u201d coordinating the bank\u2019s response to client needs, along with 15 investment advisers, McKee said.\u201cIt\u2019s not a 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday job,\u201d said McKee, 63, who spent years as a private banker for athletes before moving into his current role. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to work 24/7, seven days a week. It\u2019s not a job for everybody.\u201dRoyal Bank established a North American sports professionals segment within its private-banking division in 2004, consolidating services for athletes scattered across its branch network. But the beginnings reach back further, when McKee was a senior loans officer at a branch near the Canucks\u2019 Vancouver arena. His break came in 1991, when he landed players Trevor Linden and Cliff Ronning as clients.Royal Bank\u2019s U.S. foray starting in the late 1990s helped expand the practice of serving border-hopping NHL players. The firm extended its reach when it bought City National \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s bank to the stars \u2014 in 2015.A playbook emerged: Get athletes when they\u2019re young \u2014 often 18, 19 or 20 years old \u2014 to give them guidance before the big paychecks and bigger temptations arrive. To win over those players and their families, attending the annual NHL entry draft became a requirement \u2014 including this week\u2019s gathering in Vancouver.The opportune time is before they start to think about what they're going to do with this money \u2014 and some of it could be frivolous like buying a Ferrari or something\u201cThe opportune time is before they sign that contract, before they start to think about what they\u2019re going to do with this money \u2014 and some of it could be frivolous like buying a Ferrari or something,\u201d McKee said.Royal Bank also attracts athletes midway through their careers or approaching retirement. Today, about 18 per cent of clients are retired players.Daniel and Henrik Sedin, Swedish twins who played their entire 18-year career with the Canucks before retiring last year, know about heady career trajectories. The longtime Royal Bank clients went from getting about US$100 a game in a Swedish league in the late 1990s to earning about US$1 million a season with their first NHL contract, a three-year deal in 1999. Their salaries reached US$7 million a season in their final years.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say a lot of players make a lot of money, but for the most part players make league minimum or up to a million and a half, maybe $2 million,\u201d Henrik Sedin, 38, said in a phone interview. \u201cIf you play for three or four years, you\u2019re not going to be able to live the rest of your life doing nothing \u2014 and that\u2019s the case for the majority of players in the league.\u201dThe Sedins are a wealth manager\u2019s dream: They had long careers and lucrative contracts, yet are restrained in their spending. Their biggest indulgence came when they each spent around $150,000 on motorboats for their oceanfront home in Sweden. They didn\u2019t really enjoy them, and sold a year later at a loss.\u201cWe grew up in a family that never really talked money \u2014 we didn\u2019t think that way,\u201d Henrik Sedin said. \u201cWe were never guys that bought anything luxury or stuff like that.\u201dStill, the former captain relied on Royal Bank\u2019s acumen to help on complicated financial issues, including putting together a mortgage for an apartment in Stockholm and transferring the money abroad ahead of a tight deadline.I've played real estate agent, I've taken delivery of cars, I've delivered paperwork and so forth to weird places, to hotels.

His first client as a private banker was a newly acquired Toronto Maple Leafs player, and he\u2019s since built relationships with young athletes and their families, from their junior hockey days, to American Hockey League debuts, and on to the NHL.Young players tend to be \u201ca bit boring\u201d in their demands, Vander Voet said, unlike some players taken on later in their careers. \u201cI have clients that I\u2019ve inherited when they\u2019re close to retirement, when it\u2019s been more of a 911 instead of a 411. It\u2019s been a bit of a tire fire and we\u2019re trying to get them right again.\u201dLike his colleagues, Vander Voet won\u2019t disclose client names. He\u2019s dealing with one player eager to buy a $10 million house, and once had a Raptors basketball player who was paying $8,500 a month in rent for a condo and even more for Toronto parking stalls for his cars and those driven by his entourage.Liles\u2019 tastes have been far more modest, Camaro notwithstanding. He bought and sold some homes, but mostly rented during his career. He was tempted by a vacation club, but his Royal Bank adviser, Trevor Johnson, made him reconsider.\u201cAny time I had something in my mind that wasn\u2019t on track with my plan for my career and post-career, Trevor was always there to say \u2018Let\u2019s just table this one for a little while,\u2019\u201d Liles said. \u201cFor the most part, we\u2019ve made some pretty sound financial decisions.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Canada\u2019s home sales rise for third month, easing concerns about correction", "description": "CREA hikes its forecast from 1.6% decline to 1.2% growth", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-market-picks-up-steam-in-canada-after-slow-start-to-year?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 14, 2019 3:14 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian home sales activity continued to rebound last month, suggesting the nation\u2019s housing market is improving after a sluggish start to the year.Home sales rose 1.9 per cent nationally, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Friday from Ottawa.

The realtor group cited strong fundamentals outside of the prairie provinces, solid population and employment growth, and the expectation that the Bank of Canada will refrain from raising interest rates for the rest of the year.The realtor group also cited changes to the federal government\u2019s home buyer program, which were introduced in this year\u2019s budget and which partly took effect in late March, as supportive.\u201cThese factors are expected to support the beginnings of a recovery in home sales over the second half of 2019 after starting this year on a weak footing,\u201d the group said in a release, though it cautioned sales would probably remain \u201cwell below\u201d levels from recent years because of other government policy changes, in particular tighter mortgage qualification rules.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "The bond floodgates open in Canada with at least $22 billion raised this week", "description": "Issuers taking advantage of a lull in the global trade war", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/bond-floodgates-open-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/money.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 14, 2019 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian borrowers joined a slew of new debt deals from around the globe to raise at least $22.6 billion (US$17. billion) this week as issuers including the financing arm of the nation\u2019s housing agency and a cannabis company took advantage of a lull in the global trade war.The Canadian Housing Trust issued $5.5 billion of five-year bonds and Ontario has raised $4.33 billion in three transactions, while four out of the six largest banks are raising to $5.71 billion through benchmark-size deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At least another nine issuers have sold debt so far this week, including Canada-listed Trulieve Cannabis Corp. doing the first pot bond with a publicly available prospectus.Bond issues so far this month have already surpassed the US$18.6 billion amount raised in May, which was the slowest for such a month on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2008.

Quebec and Saskatchewan also came to the market this week.National Bank of Canada, which sold $500 million deposit notes Monday, priced US$1 billion of three-year mortgage covered bonds, in the third sale of such securities out of Canada this week. The bonds were priced at 30 basis points over the mid-swaps rates.Smaller lender Laurentian Bank of Canada priced $300 million of three-year deposit notes at a 120-basis-point spread, three days after selling $339 million of securities pooling government-backed mortgages at an spread of 52 basis points. Earlier this week, at least six Canadian financial issuers priced deals.Non-financial companies including Keyera Corp. raised debt. The natural gas company raised $600 million of hybrid bonds, which were priced to yield 6.875 per cent.Pot company Trulieve issued US$70 million of 9.75 per cent secured bonds due 2024, the company said in June 11 statement, which were sold in conjunction with 1.47 million of warrants that give investors the right to buy company shares over a three-year period.

However, Canopy as a whole will likely generate negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201dCanopy reported an adjusted gross margin of 22 per cent in the quarter ended Dec. 31 as it spent to build out new facilities and prepare for edible and beverage products that can\u2019t be sold until later this year.Canopy needs to fund its expansion into the U.S. and European markets as the legalization of cannabis boosts consumer spending on a variety of marijuana-based products. It\u2019s aiming to have hemp processing facilities in seven American states within the next 12 months, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Linton said last week.Earlier this year Canopy said it will buy Acreage Holdings Inc. in a deal conditional on the U.S. legalizing marijuana at the federal level. It has also acquired a U.K. skin-care brand to launch a new range of CBD-infused products for global sale. Linton said in February that the company may issue bonds, mortgages or set up a real estate investment trust.The Smith Falls, Ontario-based company is also closely watching the price of its $600 million (US$450 million) of convertible bonds as they trade well above their issuance level, Lee said.The 4.25 per cent securities due 2023 are quoted at around $130, compared with $100 when the notes were issued a year ago. Canopy\u2019s stock price is about $57 compared with a conversion price for the bonds of $48.17. Analysts expect Canopy\u2019s stock to rise further over the next twelve months to about $75, which may in turn support the price of the convertibles.While the increase in the company\u2019s convertible debt securities signals that it can reduce its funding costs should it go ahead with new transactions, it can impact its costs in its profit and loss report and increase the liabilities on its balance sheet. That\u2019s because the company records the value of the debt at its market price as required under the fair value accounting method.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that during our upcoming earnings release,\u201d Lee said. Canopy is scheduled to report earnings on June 20. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any specific plans at this point, but we\u2019re aware that the market price of that bond has increased materially in the last several months.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Three reasons Canadians will feel the pain of the next recession more than Americans", "description": "Signs that financial strains are higher here in Canada", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/why-the-next-recession-will-hit-canadians-harder-than-americans?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/toronto-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 10, 2019 11:41 AM EDT", "content": "The recent yield curve inversion has renewed speculation about a potential North American recession and prompted questions about how a contraction would affect households.Though it\u2019s impossible to say for certain when, or even if, such an event will occur, several indicators suggest the pain would be more severe on the Canadian side of the border than in the U.S.Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., which oversees $430 billion, says while he doesn\u2019t see signs of a debt crisis in the making, Canada\u2019s households are clearly more stretched in terms of debt and spending than their American counterparts.\u201cThere\u2019s just no latent capacity to spend or to buffer a shock in Canada, and the U.S. is very well positioned,\u201d Lascelles said by phone from Toronto. \u201cYou could lose your job and you would be okay in the U.S., or rates could go up and you\u2019d be fine, or the economy could turn down and spending could continue. In Canada, you can\u2019t really say that.\u201dHere are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada \u2014 and one that shows why the country\u2019s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada\u2019s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s about as low as it gets, historically,\u201d said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn\u2019t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.\u201cIf there were to be a recession, whether it\u2019s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,\u201d Lascelles said in a separate webcast. \u201cThey just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.\u201dCanada\u2019s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada\u2019s households are \u201csubstantially more leveraged\u201d than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.In Canada, the debt service ratio \u2014 the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt \u2014 climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern.\u201dBecause the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThe vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It\u2019s not whether you have a lot of debt, it\u2019s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada\u2019s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.\u201dIf the housing market implodes \u2014 which Lascelles isn\u2019t expecting \u2014 it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. \u201cAnd so to the extent we haven\u2019t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren\u2019t as many households that are vulnerable.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious there\u2019s a debt crisis in the making though. It\u2019s just one that\u2019s going to limit consumer spending and limit the economy more generally.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home sales surge back to highest levels since 2017 \u2014 that's pre-stress test", "description": "That is just before new mortgage stress test came into place", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-spring-back-to-highest-levels-since-2017", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 5, 2019 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market came storming back in May.Sales in Canada\u2019s biggest city soared 19 per cent from the same month a year earlier to 9,989 transactions, while prices rose, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Wednesday.

Only about $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) of Canadian uninsured mortgages have been pooled in RMBS deals, or about 0.1 per cent of the country\u2019s mortgage debt, according to rating company DBRS Ltd. No lender has widely marketed such a deal since September, when private lender MCAP sold $254 million of the notes.While previous efforts to kick-start an RMBS market have borne little fruit, this time may be different as Canadian home prices are rising at the slowest pace this decade amid higher interest rates, regulatory changes and tax increases designed to reign in surging prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver.\u201cWhile lenders are very well equipped to manage normal market risks, I suspect they are rather unwilling to take on the additional risk of future government intervention in the housing markets,\u201d said Andrey Pavlov, a professor of finance at Beedie School of Business of Simon Fraser University in Greater Vancouver. \u201cTherefore, lenders are likely more interested today than they have ever been in hedging their residential real estate exposure, and mortgage backed securities would be a good way to do so.\u201dLenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and returns \u2014 too much risk it turned out during the U.S. financial crisis when shady loans made it into MBS tranches. There\u2019s been little evidence risky mortgages have become a feature in Canada. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property.On top of raising funds, the sellers of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital they have to set aside to cover eventual losses should they meet certain conditions, including selling significant portions of the lower rated, higher risk bond tranches.The notes are repaid as borrowers pay down debt. The legal duration of the bonds could be significantly longer than the expected repayment rate suggests. This could be a useful tool for lenders to offer longer-term mortgages in a country where most of the home loans have a 5-year term. The repayment of the bonds can be adapted to the repayment of the underlying collateral.Up until 2016, Canadian lenders relied heavily on Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., the country\u2019s national housing agency to insure mortgages with down payments of less than 20 per cent and then packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities to fund obligations. But as part of its efforts to curb taxpayer exposure to the housing market, the government made it more difficult to get insurance. The market for uninsured mortgages took off \u2014 MBS based on the debt less so.\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing education job around investors just to highlight the difference between that product and the CMHC product, and we are investing in that so that the market grows over time,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an interview last week. The RMBS \u201cmarket is not nearly as developed as the CMHC mortgage bond market is. I would say our hope is over time that market will grow, and the banks generally I believe are interested in issuing that product.\u201dThe Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of participants in the bond market, has been working since at least last year to analyze the conditions and incentives that would be required to expand interest in the asset class, according to the minutes of their meetings. It conducted a focus group last month with mostly buy side institutions about the disclosure on the underlying collateral and other features they may require. The group, known as CFIF, was scheduled to discuss the issue again at a June 4 meeting.One way to bolster investors\u2019 confidence in deals would be by setting up a public database of mortgages used in securitization deals including anonymized details of the borrower, property and loan performance, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said last month. A similar project was supported by the European Central Bank in a bid to re-start sales of asset-backed securities after investors shunned hard-to-value assets following the seizure of the U.S. mortgage securitization market in 2007.\u201cA loan level data portal is a great idea,\u201d said Imran Chaudhry, a senior portfolio manager at Forresters Asset Management Inc., which manages about $8.5 billion of assets and has invested in Canadian securitizations. \u201cIssuing public RMBS deals would provide a larger investor base to the issuers and help establish a diversified funding source for them over a longer term.\u201dThe starting point of RMBS as a funding tool isn\u2019t the most attractive for banks as investors may demand an extra yield of 20 to 30 basis points over their senior bail-in debt in a stable market situation, said Chaudhry, who is part of the CFIF. Yet, once a market develops the spreads will tighten and it will make economic sense for the lenders to issue, he said.All these efforts are occurring at a time when the household debt-to-disposable income ratio in Canada at the end of 2018 hit a record high of 175 per cent, up from 136 per cent in 2006. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income ended last year at 98 per cent, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cA key domestic risk is a sharp correction in the housing market,\u201d officials at International Monetary Fund said in May 21 statement about the state of the Canadian economy. To be sure strong immigration, underlying strength in the economy and an unemployment rate near historic lows argues against such a scenario.Lenders\u2019 exposure to an eventual downturn may be increasing. According to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canadian bank regulator, the ratio of uninsured over insured mortgages has jumped to the highest since 1997.At the end of March, the volume of uninsured mortgages surged 14 per cent from a year ago, accounting for about 59 per cent of the $1.17 trillion of home loans at Canada\u2019s federally regulated banks, while insured home loans fell 7.8 per cent from a year ago, according to data from OSFI. On Tuesday, the regulator announced it was increasing a domestic stability buffer for systemically important banks to 2 per cent of their risk weighted assets from 1.75 per cent, effective Oct. 31, citing vulnerabilities that include household indebtedness.\u201cTo be clear, the system is not broken \u2014 it has served Canadians and financial institutions well,\u201d said Poloz in a May 6 speech in Winnipeg. \u201cWe should not stop looking for improvement.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg, Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander and Esteban Duarte", "title": "Bank of Montreal joins Poloz's push to bolster market for residential mortgage-backed securities", "description": "Residential mortgage-backed securities are the financing source for less than one per cent of outstanding home loans in Canada", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/bank-of-montreal-joins-polozs-push-to-bolster-market-for-residential-mortgage-backed-securities", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/bmo-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 30, 2019 12:59 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of Montreal, Canada\u2019s fourth largest bank, is working toward expanding the investor base for a residential mortgage-backed securities just as Bank of Canada\u2019s governor Stephen Poloz highlighted the idea of having such a market as a useful funding and risk management tool.Residential mortgage-backed securities are the financing source for less than one per cent of outstanding home loans in Canada, according to DBRS data.

The reason that TD and RBC in particular went south was to find greener fields.\u201dMuch of Canada is experiencing a housing slowdown and household debt is at record high, crimping further borrowing. The country also is a mature market for banking, with lenders getting much of their growth by stealing market share from each other. Canada\u2019s economic prospects are forecast to lag behind those of its southern neighbour. Gross domestic product in Canada is expected to grow 1.5 per cent this year, compared with 2.6 per cent for the U.S.That bodes well for Canadian banks with operations abroad \u2014 and less so for those relying on domestic businesses to fuel growth. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal, lenders with significant operations outside the country, report their results next week.Earnings at Canadian banks\u2019 domestic personal and commercial divisions were expected to rise 5.2 per cent on average from a year earlier, less than the 14.3 per cent increase forecast for their U.S. and international consumer-lending units, RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic said in a note to clients earlier this month.At Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which gets a greater share of profits from domestic consumer banking than its peers, earnings from its personal and small business banking division fell 2.4 per cent to $570 million. CIBC\u2019s biggest profit gains, meanwhile, came from U.S. commercial banking and wealth management, with 18 per cent growth. Canadian mortgages declined, home-equity credit lines were little changed and loan-loss provisions rose from a year ago.At Royal Bank, earnings rose 2.4 per cent in the company\u2019s Canadian division, its smallest year-over-year growth in five quarters, and far smaller than the 17 per cent jump in RBC Capital Markets earnings and 8.9 per cent surge in wealth management, which includes earnings from Los Angeles-based City National Bank.Even Toronto-Dominion, with retail-banking operations on both sides of the border, saw a greater boost from the U.S. than from Canada.

It depends on our forecasts coming true, that the slowdown is temporary and getting through all that and getting back on the track we were say a year ago, and that\u2019s going to take some doing.\u201dThe comments underscore the governor\u2019s confidence that the nation\u2019s expansion remains on solid footing, and the economy will emerge from a recent soft patch. It\u2019s a view that puts him at odds with investors betting growth will slow further and that the central bank\u2019s next move will likely be a rate cut. Markets are placing odds of a cut over the next year at about 50 per cent.The Bank of Canada has raised borrowing costs five times since 2017, but recently indicated it won\u2019t move any higher for now amid a slowdown that brought growth to a near halt at the end of last year.Asked whether his recent dovish tilt was premature, Poloz said it was triggered by an abrupt and synchronous global slowdown, stoked by trade uncertainty, that has kept companies from investing. That required a cautious approach to policy, he said.\u201cThese are sentiment-driven, soft things,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t model that mechanically and expect to predict how much a trade war and rhetoric is going to affect those things.\u201dYet, if those trade concerns get resolved, the rebound could be swift.\u201cSentiment can turn around very quickly if there\u2019s a resolution,\u201d Poloz said. If \u201csentiment goes up, investment will recover and we\u2019re back into the positive scenario where I think the global economy can grow for a long time.\u201dPoloz also speculated some of the recent weakness in the data may be understating strength in services, particularly technology, that is more difficult to measure. He said the recent run of strong jobs data probably reflects a truer picture of the economy. Canada has added 426,400 jobs over the past 12 months, the largest one-year increase since 2007.\u201cOur traditional measures capture the stuff that you can drop on your foot much more easily than the service sector,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cThe good news is there is something positive happening in addition to a gradual rebuilding process, and so it\u2019s adding up to a pretty good picture, and probably the labour market is telling us the truth.\u201dGrowth in the services sector may also be fuelling increases in capacity that are keeping inflation in check, he said.Poloz also said he would \u201cfrown\u201d upon any weakening of mortgage qualification rules that are helping to improve the quality of new credit and slowing price appreciation in some markets like Toronto and Vancouver.Poloz, who is entering the final year of his seven-year term next month, was also asked whether he would agree to stay at the job longer if asked.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously one of the options,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of different scenarios we can sketch out.

A closer reading of the studies underlying the announcement shows there\u2019s little hard evidence of actual money laundering, and even then, the amounts could be much smaller. And while one report said much of the suspect money is coming from China, the other pointed to the U.S.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to really accurately estimate the volume of flows of money laundering,\u201d said Vanessa Iafolla, who researches money laundering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to measure something that you can\u2019t see.\u201dCanada\u2019s third-largest city and its most expensive housing market is increasingly divided over what caused the cost of a typical home to surpass a million dollars in mid-2017. Premier John Horgan\u2019s government, which has pledged to make housing more affordable, is under pressure to deliver answers. He announced Wednesday a formal inquiry into money laundering.The province is planning to set up a public registry of beneficial property owners by next year \u2014 the single most important step in peeling back the anonymity that enables dirty money, many experts agree. In the meantime, it\u2019s working with educated guesstimates.The study gauged that $7.4 billion was laundered through B.C. last year. By far the biggest source of dirty cash into Canada was the U.S. at $4.9 billion, six times more than from East Asia, including China. The second study, led by a former police chief, said it identified thousands of suspect properties \u2014 none of which were used to arrive at the $7 billion figure \u2014 and declared that \u201cChina figures prominently\u201d in the flow of suspicious money.The methodology in the first study, known as the gravity model, seeks to determine how much dirty money is floating around the world, what portion needs to be laundered, and how much each region is likely to attract. Launderers are expected to gravitate to safe havens and rich economies where it\u2019s easier to hide ill-gotten gains. It assumes that criminals, like most people, channel most of their financial assets into real estate. Geographical and cultural proximity, including a history of migration, are thrown into the mix.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of proving it,\u201d but it beats the impossible task of trying to tally up transactions you don\u2019t know about, says John Walker, a former researcher with the Australian Institute of Criminology who first developed the model, said by phone.The government trumpeted thatC$5 billion of the $7 billion washed in the province last year went into real estate \u2014 the study\u2019s highest possible estimate. It may be as low as $800 million depending on how criminals save versus invest, according to the report. The study also indicates billions more are being laundered in oil-rich Alberta and Ontario, home to the financial capital Toronto.Finance Minister Carole James says dirty money was responsible for raising housing prices about 5 per cent in the province last year. The report said its best estimate was a range of 3.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent but noted \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about the figures.\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous oversimplification,\u201d says Matthew McGuire, a forensic accountant who previously worked for Canada\u2019s financial intelligence unit. \u201cThere is money being laundered through real estate, yes, but the factors that influence the change in prices of real estate are far more complex and far greater than just criminality.\u201dOn Wednesday, a government news release said the impact on Metro Vancouver prices may have been \u201cupwards of 20 per cent\u201d \u2014 the kind of geographic granularity that\u2019s impossible to calculate with current data, the report\u2019s chair Maureen Maloney had said earlier this week. The offices of Horgan, James and Attorney General David Eby didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Vancouver has for years been riveted by stories of rich Asians moving cash into the region: students and homemakers declaring no income but owning multi-million-dollar homes, Chinese high rollers showing up at casinos with hockey bags brimming with cash, and most recently, a thriving grey market in Vancouver-to-China luxury car exports that sent millions of dollars in sales-tax refunds to overseas buyers.That\u2019s fed the perception that Vancouver\u2019s money-laundering problem is in large part an Asian one.But rich economies generate the most dirty money and from crimes related to the financial sector that can move billions at the push of a button, according to Brigitte Unger, a professor at Utrecht University who modelled the Canadian study. She says the Netherlands, considered to be at the forefront in tackling dirty money, had earlier made the same mistake that \u201cmoney laundering only took place in Chinese restaurants and casinos.\u201d\u201cThe big money, I\u2019m still convinced, doesn\u2019t come from China,\u201d said Unger by phone from Vienna. \u201cThe big money comes from the U.S. and from Europe because these are the rich countries, which use Canada as a wide-open door because it has much lower restrictions on where to place your money and how to stay anonymous.\u201dThe second report had featured a luxury car dealer describing how foreign students come in 10 times a month with no credit and no income and get auto financing based on wire transfers as \u201cunequivocally money laundering.\u201dFlamboyant displays of wealth by students may be unpalatable but not necessarily criminal. An international student who returns home periodically typically isn\u2019t required to report or pay taxes on income from abroad, while cash gifts from family members aren\u2019t taxable under Canadian rules.The second study sifted through more than a million land titles looking for red flags such as overseas buyers, properties bought without financing, opaque addresses and unusual mortgage terms. More than 2,000 properties were classified high risk for simply having mailing addresses in China or Hong Kong.Ultimately, it concluded the approach had limitations.\u201cThe \u2018suspicious properties\u2019 analysis suggests that a scoring system may not be an effective way to detect properties linked to money laundering,\u201d the study said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "How much do we owe against our homes?

Yet for those seeking to quantify those risks, obtaining a precise figure for Canadian Heloc debt can be tricky.Regulators agree. That\u2019s why this month the Bank of Canada will begin collecting more detailed data on Helocs to bolster its analysis of financial-system threats. The central bank has been working informally with lenders on the reporting, which becomes a formal requirement as of May 15.Helocs can add to debt burdens because they don\u2019t typically have a fixed repayment schedule. If home prices fall, borrowers can find themselves with more debt than their properties are worth, the dreaded \u201cnegative equity\u201d scenario that played a significant role in the U.S. housing crash a decade ago. The issue has come into focus as Canada\u2019s ratio of debt to disposable income reached a record 174 per cent in the fourth quarter.\u201cGiven the flexibility Helocs can provide, borrowers can use them even in a downturn or if they lost their jobs to sustain household spending and continue to service their other debt,\u201d Robert Colangelo at credit rating company DBRS Ltd. said in a phone interview. \u201cIt makes it difficult for lenders to identify emerging credit problems.\u201dOne obstacle to getting a clear picture is that Helocs themselves are evolving.Traditional Helocs are essentially revolving lines of credit that allow homeowners to borrow up to 65 per cent of their home\u2019s value. The interest rate is usually tied to the prime lending rate, and only the interest on the loan needs to be paid each month. To qualify for a Heloc, the borrower must have at least 20 per cent home equity.Newer products combine a Heloc with a mortgage. These allow borrowers to tap as much as 80 per cent of the home\u2019s value. A maximum of 65 per cent can be withdrawn on a revolving basis \u2014 the Heloc portion \u2014 while a minimum of 15 per cent must be amortizing, meaning regular payments of principal and interest, similar to a mortgage.Growth in stand-alone Helocs has been flat, while all of the banks are seeing strong growth in the hybrid product, which is relatively less risky because it\u2019s partly amortizing, according to Himanshu Bakshi, credit research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. However, these hybrid Helocs are more complex than traditional ones, he said.Here\u2019s what we do know.Canada\u2019s six biggest banks reported $223 billion of outstanding, or drawn, Helocs as of Jan. 31. That accounted for about a tenth of the country\u2019s $2.17 trillion total household debt.But the banks don\u2019t disclose Heloc balances in the same way. The following was reported in regulatory filings or confirmed by representatives of the banks:\u2022 Toronto-Dominion Bank reported $87 billion of Helocs. However, it said 60 per cent of that, or $52.2 billion, was the amortizing portion of its blended Heloc-mortgage product, with the remaining $34.8 billion non-amortizing. \u2022 Royal Bank of Canada reported $39.6 billion of non-amortizing Helocs. A spokeswoman said the bank\u2019s amortizing home equity product is classified as a mortgage. The bank said in a filing that \u2018home equity lines of credit include term loans collateralized by residential mortgages. \u2022 Similarly, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce doesn\u2019t disclose the breakdown of amortizing versus non-amortizing balances for its hybrid product. It reported $21.8 billion in non-amortizing Helocs. \u2022 Bank of Nova Scotia reported $20.8 billion in Helocs, which only includes non-amortizing balances. Amortizing balances are reported under residential mortgages. \u2022 Bank of Montreal reports similarly to Toronto-Dominion. A spokesman said 55 per cent, or $17.4 billion of its $31.7 billion in Helocs was amortizing, while the rest, $14.3 billion, was non-amortizing. \u2022 National Bank of Canada reported $22.2 billion of Helocs, half of which are amortizing and the other half non-amortizing, according to a spokesman.One of the major concerns about non-amortizing Helocs is the possibility for borrowers to pay only the monthly interest due on the loan. A recent government report found about a quarter of Heloc borrowers routinely make interest-only payments.However, some lenders put that figure much lower. Toronto-Dominion said less than 14 per cent of its Heloc customers made interest-only payments in the past year. RBC said 7 per cent of clients for its Homeline Heloc product make only the scheduled interest payment. None of the other banks disclose that figure.According to a document on the website of Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the central bank will require a more detailed breakdown of Helocs, as well as the utilization rate, or the share of drawn amounts versus approved amounts.The Heloc data will feed into the central bank\u2019s analysis of financial system vulnerabilities and risks, spokeswoman Louise Egan said in an email. In efforts to balance transparency, confidentiality and quality, \u201cdata identifying an individual institution will not be published,\u201d she said.Toronto-Dominion Bank and Scotiabank declined to comment on the new reporting requirements, while CIBC, BMO and National Bank didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment. A Royal Bank representative said only the bank would comply with the regulations.With assistance from Paul Gulberg, Himanshu Bakshi and Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "CMHC will share equity losses, gains in Trudeau's first-time homebuyer plan", "description": "CMHC CEO says the program will have zero impact on house prices across the country", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/cmhc-will-share-equity-losses-gains-in-first-time-buyer-plan?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 9, 2019 10:42 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to make housing more affordable for millennials could result in shared gains \u2014 or losses \u2014 for taxpayers.The government announced in its March federal budget that Canada\u2019s housing agency will spend up to $1.25 billion (US$928 million) over three years to take equity stakes in homes bought by first-time buyers. CMHC will provide up to 10 per cent funding for new homes and 5 per cent for existing ones to reduce mortgage expenses for low- to middle-income buyers.\u201cIf we take a $10,000 interest on a $100,000 home, then whatever they sell the house for, that percentage gain we share, whatever percentage loss, we share,\u201d Evan Siddall, CEO of Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., said in an interview.CMHC plans to launch the program in September.

Benchmark prices are down 8.7 per cent from their peak in mid-2018 and the number of homes sitting on the market has ballooned by nearly half, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Yet those awaiting a final reckoning \u2014 and the chance to buy a home on the cheap in this picturesque West Coast city \u2014 may be disappointed, according to Tamara Vrooman, chief executive officer of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union.Real estate has been our oil, in many ways. It's been the dominant factor in our regional economy\u201cWe see no evidence of a freefall,\u201d Vrooman, 50, said in an interview at the headquarters of Canada\u2019s largest credit union. \u201cWe have certainly seen a lot of sitting on the sidelines and wait-and-see, but we\u2019re also seeing signs that we might be at the trough.\u201dOutlying suburbs and southern Vancouver Island, favoured by families and those able to work remotely or start businesses, are still seeing growth, she said. Developers are also starting to assemble lots and buy land again. One Vancity client recently tried to buy a commercial building in Vancouver listed for $20 million, but lost \u2014 the property sold for $26 million within five days after getting seven offers, she said.Vrooman has a better insight than many: Vancity provides banking services for about a quarter of the people in the metropolitan area of 2.25 million. She\u2019s well aware of the economic challenges facing borrowers and potential homebuyers in a city where the benchmark home price is still more than $1 million. According to real estate website Zoocasa, only the top 2.5 per cent of income earners can afford to buy a house in Vancouver.\u201cWe still have a huge affordability issue, of course, where it is still out of reach for household incomes of $100,000 or $120,000,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right mix of housing.\u201dHousing for families, such as two- and three-bedroom townhouses with a small yard, aren\u2019t part of Vancouver\u2019s housing supply, she said. Cheap rentals are also difficult to come by, even with Vancity financing the development of 3,000 affordable rental units in the past year.\u201cWe still see affordability as the primary issue,\u201d she said.With Canada\u2019s rising household debt levels \u201cperilously high,\u201d more needs to be done to lift incomes that have stagnated for years within British Columbia\u2019s real estate fuelled economy, according to Vrooman.\u201cReal estate has been our oil, in many ways,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the dominant factor in our regional economy.\u201dThat has caused a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of talent within the region into the property market, depleting other industries that could offer high-paying jobs and counter any downturn from real estate.Nevertheless, Vancity has benefited from the real estate boom. During Vrooman\u2019s 11 years at the helm, the co-operative has boosted assets 62 per cent while advancing its long-standing objective of upending the big banks in Canada\u2019s third-largest city. The lender has 59 branches and 2,853 employees mostly in and around the Vancouver region.It had $22.9 billion in assets at the end of 2018, when it posted $116.5 million of annual profit before taxes and distributions to the 534,000 members who own a stake in the co-operative. The credit union has added more than 25,000 members each year in the past five years, with about half aged 35 or under.\u201cWe\u2019re competing with them for the hearts and minds every day,\u201d Vrooman said of her competitors. \u201cWhen we gain market share, though, we gain it from the banks, and two in particular \u2014 TD and RBC, because they\u2019re the biggest ones.\u201dLike Canada\u2019s big banks, she\u2019s also seen a slowdown in mortgage lending amid more stringent rules and other measures in the last few years to slow B.C.\u2019s overheated housing market.\u201cWe have a speculation tax, we have a vacancy tax, we have a school tax \u2014 all of those are creating uncertainty,\u201d she said.Vancity has been countering the slowdown by focusing on mortgage renewals, capturing a 92 per cent retention rate for its home loans. The credit union is currently seeing 3 per cent to 4 per cent year-over-year growth in new mortgages, less than half the growth of three years ago.\u201cWe see it returning to what we call more normal market conditions,\u201d Vrooman said. \u201cWe see a slow but steady return to normal.\u201dWith assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Toronto housing market starts buying season with a bang, sales up 17%", "description": "Average selling price climbs 1.9% to $820,148", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-begins-busy-spring-season-with-a-bounce?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cpt128-the-canadian-press-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 6, 2019 2:03 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market entered the busy spring property season with a bang, as sales surged 17 per cent in April compared with a year earlier and prices also pushed higher.The number of transactions totalled 9,042 units last month, compared with 7,744 units in April 2018, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Monday.

Toronto\u2019s housing market cooled considerably last year as officials tightened mortgage regulations, imposed taxes on foreign buyers and took other measures designed to curb runaway prices \u2014 raising worries the steps had gone too far.Yet economic fundamentals \u2014 everything from strong employment gains to a sharp increase in immigration \u2014 remain supportive, as has the dovish tilt globally from central banks that have helped bring down borrowing costs in recent months.\u201cThe strong year-over-year growth in sales is obviously a good news story and likely represents some catchup from a slow start to the year,\u201d Garry Bhaura, TREB president, said in the statement.The improving sentiment is also bringing out more sellers, the data show, with new listings up 8 per cent from a year ago. Bhaura noted, however, demand still outpaced increased supply, pointing to the \u201congoing housing supply issue\u201d in Toronto that could fuel even more price gains.\u201cThis suggests that market conditions continued to tighten,\u201d he said.Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, are up 3.2 per cent from a year ago, the fastest appreciation in more than a year.The sales gains in April were driven by the single-family home segment, while price increases were led by condos, according to the realtor group. Prices for condominiums were up 5.1 per cent in April from a year earlier.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Mansions languish, some condos pop as Toronto home sales face spring test", "description": "Pricing is increasingly key to clinching a sale", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/mansions-languish-some-condos-pop-as-toronto-home-sales-face-spring-test?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 2, 2019 2:18 PM EDT", "content": "A one-bedroom condo plus den listed at $648,000 (US$483,600) in Toronto\u2019s east end has been sitting on the market for weeks. A similar unit in the same building priced US$69,000 cheaper ended up selling way over asking.Whether it\u2019s an apartment in a glitzy new skyscraper or a mansion in exclusive Forest Hill, pricing has become paramount as Canada\u2019s biggest city heads into the busy spring property season. As the market stabilizes after a year of plunging sales, condo sales are a mixed bag and big detached homes are hard to shift.\u201cThe right product, in the right location, at the right price will get lots of interest and likely multiple offers,\u201d said real estate agent Justin Wu, who\u2019s handling the condo that\u2019s still on the market. \u201cOthers take more work to sell.\u201dHome sales in the Toronto region have dropped 37 per cent from their peak in 2016 while prices are down 4.4 per cent since maxing out at $815,200 in May of 2017. Re-sale condo listings swelled about 10 per cent in the first quarter from the same period last year, according to research firm Urbanation Inc.Canada\u2019s federal housing agency lowered its assessment of the overall vulnerabilities in the national market to \u201cmoderate,\u201d from \u201chigh,\u201d according to a report Thursday.While there remains a \u201chigh degree of vulnerability\u201d in Toronto and Vancouver, prices are moving closer to levels supported by fundamentals.Housing across the country has been adjusting amid tighter mortgage regulations, taxes on foreign buyers and other measures designed to curb runaway prices and household debt, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. While Vancouver\u2019s market is still sinking, an influx of about 100,000 immigrants a year is providing an underpinning in Toronto, especially for condos.\u201cThe price differential between the average price of a condo apartment and a low-rise home has narrowed to its lowest level in four years, which is creating more supply competition for condos and sparking some move-up buying,\u201d Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, said.For first-time buyer Adam De Biasi getting into the condo market was a totally nerve-wracking experience.\u201cEvery delay I had, another condo would slip through my fingers,\u201d the 24-year-old engineer-in-training said in a phone interview. He felt if he didn\u2019t get into the market he\u2019d be living in a \u201cshoebox\u201d by the time he was ready to move out of his parents\u2019 home.After months of searching \u2014 and losing out \u2014 he finally landed a one-bedroom in a presale project launched by Menkes Development Corp. north of Toronto that met his his budget of about $400,000. It\u2019s right by the subway line and close to the highway.He got lucky, said Simeon Papailias, De Biasi\u2019s agent. The sales office was \u201cmayhem\u201d as buyers and agents begged for units in that pricing sweet spot. That same week, Papailias went to another presale condo launch by CentreCourt Inc. and SmartREIT, which sold out in three days. He had to weave through almost 3,000 agents competing for 490 units.\u201cThe minute anything launches \u2014 $800 per square foot \u2014 and connects to Toronto by subway, there is a complete frenzy,\u201d he said.Single-family homes are a different story. Prices across the city were up just half a per cent in March from a year ago compared, with a 7.2 per cent rise in condo prices.\u201cThere is a big challenge with low-rise, which is still suffering a lot. Even resales in established areas, it is a bit slower \u2014 I think it\u2019s going to change but right now it is a bit slower,\u201d Mark Mandelbaum, chairman of Lanterra Developments, said. \u201cWith a condo, if you don\u2019t like it, you can rent it. It\u2019s very hard to rent a house in Markham.\u201dAgain, pricing is key.Mattamy Homes, the biggest private residential homebuilder in North America, has seen hot demand for most of its single-home property launches, according to its founder, Peter Gilgan. \u201cEvery one of those launches, priced properly, is sold out after one day or two,\u201d he said in a February interview. Many of the projects are outside the Toronto core.Great Gulf Group also launched a Whitby, Ontario project this month, which had steady lineups outside its sales centre and sold out, according to spokeswoman Madeline Zito.As for Wu, the agent who\u2019s still waiting for takers on his unit in the city\u2019s east end, it simply means having to put more work in. \u201cThis is very different from a couple years ago, when it was pretty indiscriminate\u201d buying across the board, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Scrapping mortgage rules would boost Canadian\u00a0home prices by about $32,000, TD says", "description": "TD says impact of rules have been longer-lasting and more significant than originally intended and government should consider flexibility", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/scrapping-mortgage-rules-would-boost-canadian-home-prices-by-about-32000-td-says?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sold-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 30, 2019 3:22 PM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government should consider being flexible on its new mortgage lending rules because the impact has been longer-lasting and more significant than originally intended, Toronto-Dominion Bank says.Home sales were about 40,000 lower between the final quarter of 2017 and the same period a year later than they otherwise would have been without the rules, according to a note to clients Tuesday by TD economists Rishi Sondhi, Ksenia Bushmeneva and Derek Burleton. That translates into about a 7 per cent decline in sales, they said.There is also evidence of a shift in business to private lenders who are not subject to the rules, known as B-20 and implemented by Canada\u2019s banking regulator. The economists estimate the share of borrowers in Toronto accessing funds from alternative lenders increased to 8.7 per cent in the second quarter 2018, from 5.9 per cent in the same quarter a year earlier.The changes mean federally regulated lenders must now run a 200 basis-point stress test on new mortgages, to ensure the quality of lending remains high amid escalating home prices. The measures are disproportionately affecting first-time homebuyers, who normally account for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the market, as well as cities that have more youthful demographics like Toronto and Vancouver, TD said.\u201cRight now it\u2019s a one-size-fits all type of policy, and borrowers differ in their ability to service their mortgage, and they\u2019re different in terms of their risks,\u201d Bushmeneva said in a phone interview. She said policy makers could consider being flexible around the 200 basis point stress test limit, given it\u2019s \u201csomewhat arbitrary,\u201d and doesn\u2019t take into account the credit-worthiness of borrowers or their life stage.Immediately removing the rules would increase Canadian home prices an additional 6 per cent, on top of Toronto-Dominion\u2019s current forecast for a 4 per cent increase, by the end of 2020, the economists wrote, adding that would boost home prices by about $32,000 (US$24,000) on average.The rules have pushed potential buyers into the rental market, leading vacancy rates for purpose-built rental units to fall by as much as 30 basis points in Toronto and Vancouver. That poses a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d as those markets are already \u201cseverely under-supplied,\u201d with current vacancy rates at just 1 per cent, the economists wrote.Toronto-Dominion joins fellow-lender Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, along with realtors and builder groups in calls for the government to revisit its B-20 rules.According to the note, Toronto-Dominion also forecasts:Housing starts to trend lower through 2020, as B-20 crimps market for new housing.New housing construction will be a drag on growth next year, though healthy job gains and robust population growth will provide a floor.Currently bank sees Canadian home prices stabilizing by mid-year and rising 4 per cent by end of 2020. However, if B-20 was immediately removed, nationwide sales and prices could be about 8 per cent and 6 per cent higher by end of 2020, equating to about $32,000 difference in average Canadian home price, with disproportionate impacts in Toronto, Vancouver.Removal of B-20 would represent a \u201csignificant near-term boost to housing activity, though at a longer-term cost of worsened affordability.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert and Jeff Kearns", "title": "Trump hails America\u2019s blockbuster GDP growth \u2014 'far higher than the high expectations'", "description": "But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-growth-of-3-2-tops-forecasts-on-trade-inventory-boost", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 26, 2019 3:11 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter on a big boost from inventories and trade that offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending, with President Donald Trump touting the report as much stronger than expected.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized rate in the January-March period, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey calling for 2.3 per cent growth.

In the new world of Vancouver\u2019s housing market, where Chinese investors are decamping and low-ball offers are the norm, students can find themselves living in the lap of luxury.It\u2019s a far cry from the frenzy of a few years ago when the city was at the centre of a global property boom. Prices more than doubled in the decade through 2016, outpacing gains in New York and London. But government policies to tame the market \u2014 from new taxes to stricter mortgage regulations \u2014 have fuelled a plunge in sales to the weakest since the global financial crisis. Prices are down 8.5 per cent from their peak in June, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.The city boasts a thriving tech and tourism scene and sits in the province with the lowest unemployment rate in the country. But the sense of unease in the real estate market is palpable.Here are some stories from a property market in upheaval:With taxes on an empty Vancouver home potentially adding up to 3 per cent in annual levies, homeowners are rushing to lease their homes, according to real estate agents. That\u2019s leading to bargains in a city where the vacancy rate has been near zero per cent.\u201cYou have houses that are worth $4 million renting for $4,500,\u201d said Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor whose popular real estate blog was pointing out cracks in the market even as benchmark prices peaked last year.Prospective tenants are getting bold, said Kevin Wang, who runs a sales and rental real estate team with his twin brother Jerry. They\u2019ve received calls from people offering to help with gardening or maintenance in exchange for free rent in a luxury home.The owner of \u201cThe Castle\u201d\u00a0and the rental agency didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Everyday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I'm just like, that's my houseFor his part, Boodhoo, not only has he scored luxury digs, he\u2019s cut his commute time to his classes in music production to about 18 minutes from two hours.\u201cEveryday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I\u2019m just like, that\u2019s my house,\u201d said Boodhoo, who\u2019s looking forward to the pool in the backyard. It should be filled by June.Lisa Sun paces around the Vancouver mansion she\u2019s been hired to sell by its wealthy Chinese-Canadian owner. The family\u2019s had it with the new taxes and what it sees as increasing hostility to Asian capital. Sun reckons that early last year the home would have easily sold for about $8.5 million \u2014 holes in the wall and all.Today, the 28-year-old realtor isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll get a credible offer for the 8,343 square-foot mansion. These days a pool, wine cellar, and home theatre on a prime lot aren\u2019t enough to clinch a deal, even in West Vancouver, where opulent homes carved out of steep slopes overlook the ocean. Sun needs a \u201cstager\u201d to empty the house and brighten it up with new furniture, a modern chandelier, and lick of paint.\u201cI\u2019ve been through only the peak, never the low,\u201d said Sun as she schedules a makeover of the property. Pink tags indicate to the four cleaners what needs to be dumped. The Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce in the garage, relatively unused for three years, also need to be dealt with.The house is listed at $10.9 million, but after receiving mostly low-ball offers closer to its tax-assessed value of $6.2 million, she\u2019s planning on dropping the asking price closer to $8.3 million.Why would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?That\u2019s a hefty cut but holding on to the home would mean paying potentially more than $140,000 in extra taxes annually for the Canadian owner who splits her time between Vancouver and Beijing. Canadian taxes are not the only measures weighing on the market. China\u2019s capital controls are also limiting spending on global real estate.Sun doesn\u2019t think Vancouver\u2019s market is going to come back to its highs, especially at the top end. \u201cWhy would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?\u201dBuying a house seemed an impossible dream for Brandon Chapman.The 28-year-old financial planner first started looking at one-bedroom condos in 2016, around the peak of the market. \u201cIt was just bananas so I took a step back,\u201d he said, in an interview at his Vancouver office.He\u2019s glad he waited. He now figures he might even be able to afford a detached home and is viewing properties at around the $1.1 million mark in East Vancouver. To make it affordable, he\u2019s teaming up with his best friend to purchase the property \u2014 and offering way under asking. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out yet. One offer for about $200,000 less than the listing price was rejected.It's like a candy store for buyers right now\u201cWe haven\u2019t closed on anything but the market in my opinion is still trending down so why would I rush into buying something if I don\u2019t need it this second?\u201d he said.Then there\u2019s Robin Rickards, who happened to be looking for a temporary home at a serendipitous time. The 64-year-old orthopedic surgeon needed a place to stay while his current home was being rebuilt into an oceanside oasis. He ended up making an offer on three different homes and got one for almost $1 million less than the original asking price.\u201cIt\u2019s like a candy store for buyers right now,\u201d Clara Hartree, the realtor working with Rickards, said by email.The twisty, cantilevered glass tower is one of Vancouver\u2019s most hotly anticipated developments.

Last year, it would\u2019ve fetched as much as $800,000, says Jerry Huang, a realtor with Nu Stream Realty Inc., which specializes in presale developments.\u201cThat\u2019s an insane deal,\u201d he said. Presales were once seen as a slam dunk \u2014 put down a 20 per cent deposit, flip the contract at a premium before completion, and pocket the gains.Westbank said in an email that in the five years since some investors purchased, values have appreciated from 25 per cent to 100 per cent depending on the unit.

That resiliency could soon be tested if crude loses momentum.Many forecasters appear skeptical about the prospects for oil to advance much beyond its current level, potentially sapping some support from the loonie. West Texas Intermediate was at around US$63 per barrel on Monday and the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey is for it to end the year near that level.\u201cWe don\u2019t see the same impetus coming from oil prices,\u201d said Bipan Rai, the North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cSo it begs the question about whether we can rely on incoming data to really drive some support for the loonie. That\u2019s still pretty much a wild card.\u201dThe Canadian dollar has advanced 1.9 per cent this year against the U.S. currency, trailing only the British pound among its Group-of-10 peers. Oil has provided some buoyancy, but Canada\u2019s domestic picture has been more cloudy. There is mounting concern about household indebtedness, home prices are dropping and growth practically ground to a halt in the final part of 2018. A Bank of Canada survey released Monday that showed softening business sentiment dented the loonie, dragging it down around 0.4 per cent on the day.While growth numbers for January were more upbeat and unemployment remains close to multi-decade lows, the central bank has become more circumspect. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz this month suggested that he is settling into a holding pattern on interest-rate policy. The global slowdown, coupled with a housing sector that is taking longer to adjust to tighter mortgage rules and higher rates, means the economy still needs the help of low borrowing costs, the BOC boss said.\u201cCanada\u2019s got to worry about an additional factor that the U.S. doesn\u2019t at this point, and that is the fact that our household sector is extremely leveraged,\u201d said Rai, who is based in Toronto. \u201cIt could prove to be a much more prolonged slowdown given that you may see households deleveraging.\u201dHe sees the loonie weakening to around $1.36 per greenback by the end of this year and $1.40 in 2020. It was at $1.3377 on Monday.Toronto-Dominion Bank also sees the Canadian currency coming under pressure, with currency strategist Mazen Issa pointing not only to risks from household debt but also potential spillover effects from international trade fights.\u201cWe\u2019re basically looking at a situation that is very difficult to find any positives for the Canadian dollar overall,\u201d said Issa. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s probably going to continue to get worse.\u201dNot all observers are so pessimistic though. Bank of Montreal\u2019s global head of foreign-exchange strategy, Greg Anderson, expects the loonie to rally to $1.30 per dollar by year end, while Scotiabank forecasts it will go to to $1.27.Eric Theoret at Scotiabank sees a weak greenback environment fuelling commodity-price gains and boosting Canada\u2019s terms of trade, and says there\u2019s room for improvement in the currency if crude prices continue to rise.\u201cIf oil prices keep moving the way they are, it should allow the Bank of Canada to withdraw some of the accommodation that they are currently providing,\u201d said Theoret.Even if oil recovers, RBC Wealth Management expects the Canadian dollar to trade around its current levels until mid-year, with some modest softness taking it to a range of $1.34 to $1.36 per dollar by year end. Laura Cooper, head of FX solutions and strategy at RBC Wealth, sees limited scope for oil to bolster the loonie because pipeline constraints are helping to maintain a price gap between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark price. She\u2019s also doubtful of any major shift from rate differentials, since both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are signaling extended tightening-cycle pauses.\u201cIn the absence of a catalyst coming from rate dynamics or commodity prices, we see the currency trading broadly sideways in coming months,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "Canadian home sales remain at lowest levels in six years", "description": "Sales down 4.6% and prices fell 0.5% from a year earlier", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-market-remains-sluggish-in-canada-despite-march-rebound", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/house-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2019 10:35 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian home sales and prices rebounded in March from a dismal showing a month earlier, but remained below historical averages.Home sales rose 0.9 per cent nationally while the benchmark price rose 0.8 per cent, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Monday from Ottawa.

He cited recent data \u2014 the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January \u2014 to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.\u201cThere are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.\u201dPoloz\u2019s comments are the first since a segment of Canada\u2019s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada\u2019s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need \u2014 at least over time \u2014 for rates to move higher. He didn\u2019t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada\u2019s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term \u2014 unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.In his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy\u2019s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to \u201cpositive growth\u201d later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will \u201ceventually be completed.\u201d Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials \u201cthey need to make new investments,\u201d aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.\u201cWe only have to look back a few years for an example,\u201d said Poloz, \u201cfollowing the oil price collapse of 2015.\u201dHe also cited \u201cnumerous advantages\u201d beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth \u2014 including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a \u201cportfolio\u201d of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials \u2014 after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector \u2014 can \u201csee many areas of encouraging economic growth\u201d in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.\u201cThese data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cJudging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Trudeau's new housing measures could end up crushing sales in an already depressed market", "description": "Help for first-time homebuyers doesn't come into effect until the fall, meaning some might hold off on jumping into real estate until they can take advantage", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/trudeaus-new-housing-measures-could-mute-home-sales-until-fall?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/for-sale-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 21, 2019 11:19 AM EDT", "content": "New measures for first-time home buyers could keep Canada\u2019s housing market at cooler levels until autumn, according to a report by Royal Bank of Canada.Canada\u2019s most recent federal budget included help for first-time home buyers that would see the country\u2019s housing agency take as much as a 10 per cent stake in newly built homes, or up to 5 per cent in an existing one.

In its statement following a two-day meeting in Washington, the Federal Open Market Committee repeated January language that it will be \u201cpatient\u201d amid \u201cglobal economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s signal that it will keep interest rates on hold for the full year reflects concerns that economic growth is slowing, lower energy prices are weighing on inflation and risks from abroad are dimming the outlook. The projections go further than the one-hike forecast analysts had expected in a Bloomberg survey.In a separate statement Wednesday, the Fed said it would start slowing the shrinking of its balance sheet in May and halt the drawdown altogether at the end of September. After that, the Fed will likely hold the size of the portfolio \u201croughly constant for a time,\u201d which will allow reserve balances to gradually decline.Beginning in October, the Fed will roll its maturing holdings of mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, using a cap of US$20 billion per month. The initial investment in new Treasury maturities will \u201croughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding,\u201d the Fed said. The central bank is still deliberating the longer-run composition of its portfolio and said \u201climited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run.\u201dThe 10-0 decision held the target range of the federal funds rate steady at 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Powell is scheduled to begin a press conference at 2:30 p.m.While the central bank is very close to its twin goals of low and stable inflation and full employment, Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues must contend with risks from abroad, including slowing growth in Europe and China and possible spillovers from Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.Those headwinds contributed to sharp financial-market volatility late last year. U.S. stocks recorded their steepest December losses since the Great Depression as President Donald Trump publicly hammered Powell to stop raising rates and investors saw the Fed\u2019s projected hikes as a policy mistake.Stocks have rebounded since the Fed made a dovish pivot in January, replacing a reference to further gradual rate increases with a pledge for patience. Wednesday marked policy makers\u2019 first opportunity since December to lay out in quarterly forecasts the extent to which their projections for hikes have changed.Economic growth \u201chas slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,\u201d the FOMC said in its statement. \u201cJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months\u201d despite \u201clittle changed\u201d payrolls in February. \u201cOverall inflation has declined,\u201d though excluding food and energy it \u201cremains near 2 per cent,\u201d the central bank said.Policymakers also lowered economic-growth projections for this year and next, giving a 2.1 per cent median estimate for 2019, a full percentage point below last year\u2019s pace.The less upbeat assessment in the statement compared with January\u2019s language saying growth was solid, consumer spending was strong and business investment had moderated.The projections showed 11 of 17 officials saw no hikes this year, while four expected one rate increase and two people projected two hikes. Policymakers expect to lift rates once in 2020, to 2.6 per cent by the end of that year, and hold them steady in 2021.That compares with a December projection for a 3.1 per cent rate in 2020 and 2021, with borrowing costs converging to 2.75 per cent in the longer run, according to the median path. That long-run estimate was unchanged in Wednesday\u2019s forecasts.The Fed formally adopted its 2 per cent inflation goal in 2012, and price gains have mostly come in on the low side since then.Policymakers slightly lowered their expectations for inflation relative to their last set of economic projections. After 1.8 per cent headline inflation in 2019, they see price gains of 2 per cent on both the main and core indexes for the next two years, eliminating the overshoot they had previously projected.Officials see unemployment at 3.7 per cent by year-end, higher than their previous estimate of 3.5 per cent. At the same time, they lowered their long-run jobless rate projection to 4.3 per cent, suggesting the labour market is running less hot than they previously thought.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "Get ready for a new wave of spending in budget today amid a revenue windfall and looming election", "description": "Liberal government has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/get-ready-for-a-new-wave-of-spending-in-budget-today-amid-a-revenue-windfall-and-looming-election?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/budget-shoes.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 19, 2019 8:03 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s next budget will look very familiar, with Justin Trudeau set to spend much of a revenue windfall and continued red ink in his government\u2019s books.Finance Minister Bill Morneau will unveil his fourth fiscal plan Tuesday amid an economic slowdown and a dip in the polls for Trudeau\u2019s team amid allegations of judicial interference. The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending.\u201cThis is an election budget, it\u2019s safe to say,\u201d Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country\u2019s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder\u2019s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. \u201cWe should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,\u201d Hyder said.The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation\u2019s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday\u2019s budget, Morneau\u2019s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.Despite that windfall, there\u2019s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.\u201cWe expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,\u201d Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.Of the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight \u201cskills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you\u2019re currently in it.\u201dThat could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. \u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year\u2019s budget,\u201d said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been \u201cvery beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.\u201dOn housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure \u201cmillennials can see some optimism for them and their families,\u201d suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it\u2019s stable,\u201d Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. \u201cWhat we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.\u201dThe budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government\u2019s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau\u2019s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.Morneau has also said the government will \u201cmake sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism\u201d and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded \u201cpharmacare\u201d program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party\u2019s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he\u2019s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada\u2019s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Gary Shilling, Commentary", "title": "A recession is coming \u2014 and maybe a bear market, too", "description": "Gary Shilling: The recessionary indicators are numerous", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/a-recession-is-coming-and-maybe-a-bear-market-too", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/investing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 18, 2019 1:12 PM EDT", "content": "I first suggested the U.S. economy was headed toward a recession more than a year ago, and now others are forecasting the same.

By my count, the other 12 times the central bank restricted credit in the post-Second World War era, a recession resulted.It\u2019s also possible that the current economic softening is temporary, but a revival would bring more Fed restraint. Policy makers want higher rates in order to have significant room to cut in the next recession, and the current 2.25 per cent to 2.50 per cent range doesn\u2019t give them much leeway. The Fed also dislikes investors\u2019 zeal for riskier assets, from hedge funds to private equity and leveraged loans, to say nothing of that rankest of rank speculations, Bitcoin. With a resumption in economic growth, a tight credit-induced recession would be postponed until 2020.\u201cRecession\u201d conjures up spectres of 2007-2009, the most severe business downturn since the 1930s in which the S&P 500 Index plunged 57 per cent from its peak to its trough. The Fed raised its target rate from 1 per cent in June 2004 to 5.25 per cent in June 2006, but the main event was the financial crisis spawned by the collapse in the vastly-inflated subprime mortgage market.Similarly, the central bank increased its policy rate from 4.75 per cent in June 1999 to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.\u00a0 Still, the mild 2001 recession that followed was principally driven by the collapse in the late 1990s dot-com bubble that pushed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index down by a whopping 78 per cent.The 1973-1975 recession, the second deepest since the 1930s, resulted from the collapse in the early 1970s inflation hedge buying of excess inventories. That deflated the S&P 500 by 48.2 per cent. The federal funds rate hike from 9 per cent in February 1974 to 13 per cent in July of that year was a minor contributor.The remaining eight post-Second World War recessions were not the result of major financial or economic excesses, but just the normal late economic cycle business and investor overconfidence. The average drop in the S&P 500 was 21.2 per cent.At present, I don\u2019t see any major economic or financial bubbles that are just begging to be pricked. The only possibilities are excess debt among U.S. nonfinancial corporations and the heavy borrowing in dollars by emerging-market economies in the face of a rising greenback. Housing never fully recovered from the subprime mortgage debacle. The financial sector is still deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis. Consumer debt remains substantial but well off its 2008 peak in relation to household income.Consequently, the recession I foresee will probably be accompanied by about an average drop in stock prices. The S&P 500 fell 19.6 per cent from Oct. 3 to Dec. 24, but the recovery since has almost eliminated that loss. A normal recession-related decline of 21.2 per cent \u2014 meeting the definition of a bear market \u2014 from that Oct. 3 top would take it to 2,305, down about 18 per cent from Friday\u2019s close, but not much below the Christmas Eve low of 2,351.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto Real Estate Board calls for looser mortgage rules as monthly sales drop most in a year", "description": "Realtors warn of \u2018hit to the economy\u2019 in the billions of dollars if declines continue", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/realtors-plead-for-looser-mortgages-as-toronto-sales-drop-again?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/house-sale1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 5, 2019 11:30 AM EST", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market posted its biggest monthly sales decline in a year last month, prompting the city\u2019s realtor board to call for a review of new mortgage rules it says are keeping buyers on the sidelines.Sales fell 7.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis to 6,212, the largest decline since February 2018, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Tuesday.

The same\u2019s true for his household finances.The billionaire recently took out US$61 million in mortgages on five properties in California, four in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles and one in Hillsborough, in the Bay Area. The Morgan Stanley loans, signed in the final days of 2018, represent about US$50 million in new borrowing. One refinancing on a 20,200-plus square-foot property he bought in 2012 for US$17 million turned a US$10 million loan into a US$19.5 million debt.His monthly payment: about $180,000.The loans show how even the wealthiest people use mortgages to maintain liquidity. Musk, with a US$23.4 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is among ultra-wealthy property owners including Mark Zuckerberg, Ken Griffin, and Beyonce and Jay-Z who have taken out monster mortgages. Citadel founder Griffin stands out, with two secured in 2016 for a total of about US$114 million.Representatives for Musk at Tesla didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment. Susan Siering, a spokeswoman at Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.Huge mortgages like Musk\u2019s are lending-world unicorns. Across most of the U.S., a loan falls into the jumbo category (also called non-conforming) once it exceeds US$484,350. The definition of a super jumbo isn\u2019t as clear, but for a wealth-management operation catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients they might start in the US$2 million to US$2.5 million range.\u201cOnce you get above probably US$10 million, I\u2019d describe it as \u2018by appointment,\u201d\u2018 said Michael Blum, group managing director and head of the banking group at UBS Wealth Management USA. At that level, the number of loans \u201cthins quite a bit,\u201d he said.More than 230 single-family mortgages of US$10 million to US$20 million were outstanding in 2018, with 75 per cent taken out since 2013, a CoreLogic analysis of U.S. public data found. More than half were secured by homes in California, said Frank Nothaft, CoreLogic\u2019s chief economist. About 180 were refinancings.Over the years, Musk has used his shares in Tesla Inc. to obtain personal loans. About 40 per cent of his stake in the electric carmaker was pledged at the end of 2017, according to a regulatory filing. Musk also inquired with at least one bank last year about a personal loan tied to his stake in rocket company SpaceX, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Musk, 47, doesn\u2019t take a salary from Tesla, and he\u2019s repeatedly gone to the market to buy the carmaker\u2019s stock in a show of confidence in the company, which has never turned an annual profit. He recently put one of his Los Angeles-area homes on the market for US$4.5 million.He\u2019s played down the extent to which wealth motivates him, tweeting in October that he had \u201cvery little time for recreation\u201d and saying that he didn\u2019t have \u201cvacation homes or yachts or anything like that.\u201dThe entrepreneur has a wide web of dealings with Morgan Stanley, whose private bank was the lender on his recent mortgages. When Musk pledged Tesla shares at the end of 2017, 55 per cent were with the lender. Morgan Stanley, which has a US$2.3 trillion wealth-management unit, has tripled loans to high-net-worth individuals in the past five years.Musk has also been a client of the firm\u2019s investment bank, hiring it and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year when he considered taking Tesla private. Both were lead underwriters on stock and convertible-debt offerings for the company.As home prices continue to rise in high-cost areas, more properties will fall into the super-jumbo loan category, CoreLogic\u2019s Nothaft said. Many will be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, with initial fixed-rate terms of five years, meaning refinancing volume is likely to increase as short-term rates rise.Musk\u2019s loans are for 30 years with a fixed 3.5 per cent interest rate for the first few years and then adjust based on an index.Providing mega-mortgages helps bank profit margins in the short run, and is highly strategic long-term.\u201cTo get a new relationship on the investment side with a new high-net-worth client is very difficult,\u201d said Gauthier Vincent, lead wealth management consulting partner for Deloitte. \u201cOn the credit side, it\u2019s a much easier way to get in, if you\u2019re really good at it, than to try and compete on the investments.\u201dBespoke lending also makes clients \u201cstickier,\u201d said Brent Beardsley, who leads Boston Consulting Group\u2019s work in asset and wealth management globally. If a client has a difficult-to-value loan, it\u2019s harder for them to leave for a rival. Depending on the source of their wealth, loans can lead a banker into a client\u2019s business finances, which may be commingled with personal assets, Beardsley said.Why do the ultra-wealthy even need to take out loans? Some, like Musk, are asset-rich but relatively cash-poor. Lending activity picks up as tax time approaches, with clients either fully invested or not as liquid as they need to be to make a tax payment, UBS\u2019s Blum said.\u201cWe try to educate clients that what you probably don\u2019t want to do is sell stocks or bonds and create yet another tax liability by selling so you can pay your taxes this year,\u201d Blum said.Ultra-wealthy investors may also find mortgage interest a relatively small price to pay for liquidity. \u201cWith rates still historically low, it\u2019s still a very attractive alternative,\u201d Blum said. \u201cClients would just rather not tie up all the liquidity in a purchase of a very expensive property.\u201dLending to the wealthy extends beyond mortgages. The most bread-and-butter type of asset-based borrowing is securities-based lending on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Other assets that can be borrowed against include art, yachts, pre-IPO shares and hedge-fund stakes. Hedge funds and the general partners in private-equity funds may take out so-called partner loans in order to invest in a new fund without tapping their own liquidity, said Deloitte\u2019s Vincent.Then there are the truly rarefied loans. Vincent recalls one situation with a Middle Eastern client from the days when he was a private banker. The client wanted to buy a Boeing 747 \u201cand redo the inside so his family could fly from the Middle East to London to Paris to do their shopping on the weekend,\u201d Vincent said.\u2013With assistance from Dana Hull.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canadians using their homes as ATMs in a swooning housing market put financial system at risk: DBRS", "description": "Borrowers could find themselves with a debt load that exceeds the value of their home", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/canadians-keep-using-their-homes-as-atms-even-as-market-swoons", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/0611moneyhouse.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 21, 2019 2:33 PM EST", "content": "Canadians are ramping up borrowing against their homes even as the real estate market slumps, exposing the country\u2019s financial system to vulnerabilities, rating company DBRS said.Home equity lines of credit, or Helocs, reached a record $243 billion as of Oct. 31, or 11.3 per cent of total household credit, the highest share since mid-2015, analysts including Robert Colangelo said in a report Thursday. Borrowing to fund everything from home renovations to car purchases has grown faster than residential mortgages since 2017, and undrawn commitments at the large Canadian banks stood at $120 billion.\u201cThe flexibility of Helocs could increase financial system vulnerabilities,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cIn the event of a correction, borrowers could find themselves with a debt load that exceeds the value of their home, which is often referred to as negative equity.\u201dIn addition, Heloc borrowing may also make it more difficult for lenders to identify emerging credit problems, because borrowers can use Helocs to manage increases in their debt loads by consolidating high-interest loans into a secured credit line that charges a lower interest rate, according to the report.Toronto-Dominion Bank has the largest exposure to Helocs at about 39 per cent, followed by Royal Bank of Canada at 18 per cent and the other large banks averaging 11 per cent, according to the report.Sales of new homes in Toronto sunk to the lowest in almost two decades in 2018 and the supply of unsold condos piled up, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association report released Feb. 1.

The current 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent target for the benchmark federal funds rate is at the bottom of their range of estimates for the neutral rate that neither speeds up nor slows the economy. Investors see rates staying on hold all year and lean toward a cut in 2020, according to pricing in interest-rate futures.The Fed\u2019s balance sheet policy also probably played a large role in the discussions. Officials issued a separate statement last month committing to an operational strategy of abundant bank reserves, which means a bigger balance sheet than would otherwise the case.They also said they would be flexible in shrinking their holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, depending on the economy. That was a shift from their previous guidance that they\u2019d be prepared to resume asset purchases if the economy weakened to the extent that it warranted a big cut in rates.But they were silent on when they\u2019d cease the rolloff, though a couple of officials have since said they\u2019re open to halting this year.\u201cWe are going to get a sense of the landing point\u201d for the balance sheet, said Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York, referring to a stopping point in the rundown of bank reserves. \u201cThe minutes are likely to send a signal that the end of the reduction in the Fed\u2019s Treasury portfolio could come as early as April.\u201dThe current pace of rolloffs, capped now at US$50 billion per month, was criticized by some Fed watchers as \u201cquantitative tightening,\u201d a play on the quantitative easing description given to the central bank\u2019s emergency asset purchases to protect the economy from the Great Recession.Another source of critical information from the minutes will be how officials discuss risks. Chairman Jerome Powell said in his Jan. 30 press conference the shift in the statement was not driven by a change in the outlook, but by the risks that it faces. He noted that inflation pressures were \u201cmuted,\u201d that growth was slowing in China and Europe, that Brexit remained unresolved and that financial conditions were tighter.Just how these risks will impact officials\u2019 outlook for U.S. growth could provide insight into how long the Fed will be on hold.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "CIBC sees Canadian dollar falling to 15-year lows \u2014 that\u2019s 71 cents", "description": "The last time the loonie was that weak was between 1998 and 2003", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/cibc-sees-canadian-dollar-falling-to-15-year-lows-on-weak-exports?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/loonie1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 19, 2019 12:19 PM EST", "content": "The Canadian dollar may need to fall to the lowest levels in at least 15 years to allow exporters to drive the nation\u2019s expansion, according to CIBC Capital Markets.Given the limited scope of relying further on mortgage and consumer debt, Canada will need to produce better outcomes from exports and business spending to fuel growth, CIBC economists Avery Shenfeld and Royce Mendes said Tuesday in a report.

But it was left out of the boom that saw home prices in Toronto and Vancouver surge to levels that made those cities unaffordable and prompted a rush of regulations to slow down them down.These measures have included new regional taxes on foreign buyers in Toronto and Vancouver that aren\u2019t in place in Montreal. Higher interest rates and tougher rules for mortgage lending also seem to be having the biggest effect on the country\u2019s priciest markets.January saw home sales in Montreal climb the fastest in a decade as lower prices and a booming economy lured buyers.

On average, about 2.4 per cent of shares of the six biggest Canadian banks is held in short-interest positions as of the end of January, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Vindication for those shorts appears some way off for now. The eight-member S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index has tread water for about two years. It gained about 3.3 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent increase in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and a 4.4 per cent gain in the U.S. KBW Bank Index.Canadian bank executives have already been conveying their expectations for slower growth this year.Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s Teri Currie, who oversees the domestic banking division at Canada\u2019s largest bank by assets, expects \u201cmid-single digit\u201d growth this year in residential secured lending, which includes amortizing home-equity credit lines and mortgages.\u201cIn today\u2019s context it\u2019s sending a strong statement that the investments that we\u2019ve made are going to pay off in relatively good growth,\u201d she said in a Jan. 22 interview.Executives at rival banks are expecting domestic mortgage growth to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2019, when the country\u2019s economic expansion is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent.Investor David Baskin, whose Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion, said he\u2019d rather banks focus on wealth management. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for the banks to grow their mortgage business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the juice is.\u201dSteve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7.5 billion, said the banks are countering the slowdown in residential lending with growth in business loans \u2014 something that makes Belisle a bit uneasy. Canada\u2019s six biggest banks had an 11 per cent jump in commercial lending last year.\u201cThe overall loan growth for the banks is actually steady \u2014 it has been around 4.5 per cent \u2014 and that\u2019s because they are offsetting the slowdown in mortgages with commercial lending, which is low double digits,\u201d Belisle said. \u201cThat\u2019s adding risk at the peak of the economic cycle.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto new home sales plunge to lowest in almost 20 years as unsold condos pile up", "description": "'Greater caution' should be taken when investing in new condo units, warns research firm", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-new-home-sales-plunge-as-buyers-balk-at-spiraling-prices", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 1, 2019 8:05 AM EST", "content": "New home buyers finally reached their limit in Toronto last year.After years of frenzied price increases, sales of new homes in Canada\u2019s biggest city sunk to the lowest in almost two decades in 2018 and the supply of unsold condos piled up, according to a pair of new reports released Friday.The market has started to normalize after unprecedented activity in recent years\u201cGreater caution\u201d should be taken when investing in new condo units, particularly over the short-term, as trends point toward slower appreciation, Shaun Hildebrand, president of condo research firm Urbanation, said in the report.

That\u2019s the lowest annual number since Toronto-based Altus started tracking the figures in 2000.Single-family homes showed the biggest decline, plunging 50 per cent to 3,831 from 2017 and 74 per cent below the 10-year average. Condos sales fell 38 per cent to 21,330, but only 4 per cent below the 10-year average.While the benchmark price of a new single-family home slumped 6.7 per cent to $1,143,505 in December on the year, condo prices surged 11 per cent to $796,815, according to BILD\u2019s report.But figures from Urbanation show further weakness building in condos as well. A record 21,991 units are expected to be completed this year, up 29 per cent from 2017. While 98 per cent of those units are pre-sold, more than half were bought by investors who will either rent their units or sell them, the firm said.The number of unsold units in development jumped 47 per cent in the fourth quarter from the year before to more than a two-year high and price gains for units under development grew only 0.4 per cent between the third and fourth quarters, the smallest quarterly increase in almost three years.\u201cThe slowdown in activity last year can partly be attributed to less demand from investors, who typically represent the largest component of new condominium purchasers,\u201d in the Toronto region, according to Urbanation\u2019s report.\u201cThe market is out of balance,\u201d said David Wilkes, president and chief executive officer of BILD, an industry group for about 1,500 companies in the Toronto region. \u201cWe join other industry groups in calling on the federal government to revisit the stress test and allow a longer amortization period for first-time buyers.

She wants Toronto-Dominion to be No. 1 in all areas of banking, and she maintains the company\u2019s No. 4 position for these hybrid home loans pitched as mortgage substitutes doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201cOur goal is to be the undisputed leader in all categories of Canadian banking,\u201d Currie said in an interview last week at the Toronto headquarters. \u201cWe are below our embedded growth opportunity in that product in particular, so I continue to feel comfortable that on a relative basis we\u2019ll have pretty good growth.\u201dCanada\u2019s economy is cooling after years of growth fuelled by real estate investment and consumer borrowing, and as higher interest rates and regulations bite into the housing market. Such a backdrop, along with near-record household debt levels, is making policymakers skittish about borrowing burdens.The government\u2019s Financial Consumer Agency of Canada targeted home-equity credit lines in a report this month, noting that about a quarter of Canadians with such debt are paying only interest. Over the past 15 years, HELOCs have been the largest contributor to household debt outside of mortgages.That has investor David Baskin worried about government stepping in with more rules, bringing uncertainty to banks that have profited from this lending.\u201cHELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealots,\u201d said Baskin, whose firm Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think they are a huge issue in Canada as long as rates are low and the loan-to-value ratios are reasonable, which they usually are.\u201dToronto-Dominion has two types of HELOCs, and while the bank has seen little growth in its non-amortizing product, another offering introduced four years ago as a HELOC-mortgage hybrid has seen rapid growth. Those loans jumped 33 per cent last fiscal year to $44.1 billion, surpassing the overall size of the older product.HELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealotsThe bank has been playing catchup to others that have long offered such hybrid loans, and Currie\u2019s effort is more designed to recapture lost business from customers who turned to rivals for those loans instead of an aggressive push for new clients. In the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, 90 per cent of new HELOCs went to existing customers.The growth helped Toronto-Dominion post 10 straight months of market-share growth and post record profit in its Canadian retail business, a 10 per cent jump unmatched by domestic competitors.\u201cThat outperformance really helped us in 2018,\u201d she said.Toronto-Dominion is likely to increase its home-loans portfolio by \u201cmid single digits\u201d in 2019, after last year\u2019s six per cent growth rate, according to Currie.Currie said she\u2019s comfortable with the risks to the bank and its customers, noting that a \u201clarge majority\u201d of its borrowers make principal repayments regularly in those amortizing loans.Other priorities include gaining more business from business credit cards and mutual funds. Toronto-Dominion has added training for investment advisers in its branches to help them improve customer conversations \u2014 and the bank\u2019s No. 2 standing in funds.The overall strategy under Currie, who has headed Canadian banking for three years, hasn\u2019t deviated much as the bank continues to push extended branch hours and convenience. Still, the bar to poach customers remains high.\u201cThey\u2019re basically as good as the rest,\u201d Baskin said, adding that taking market share is tough. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult because of the size of the Canadian market for any of the banks to gain a huge advantage over the other banks in Canada: it\u2019s entrenched customers, the market is pretty split up and there\u2019s a lot of inertia.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Stress tests on private lenders not being considered, Morneau says", "description": "Finance Minister said he's not considering any additional regulations to address the growth of private mortgage lenders", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/stress-tests-on-private-lenders-not-being-considered-morneau-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 28, 2019 3:54 PM EST", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he\u2019s not considering any additional regulations to address the growth of private mortgage lenders.\u201cI\u2019m not currently considering any stress tests on private mortgage lenders,\u201d Morneau told reporters in Ottawa.

In a background document released in November, the ministry touted the economic benefits of adding 10,000 housing starts a year, an amount builders estimate would bring supply closer to demand.Supply side measures are seen as critical to restoring affordability in some of Canada\u2019s largest cities like Toronto, where prices have doubled since 2010. They would also ease pressure on policy makers to implement demand curbs that are seen as unnecessarily disruptive.\u201cWe have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable cost,\u201d Clark said in a telephone interview, describing the affordability issue as a \u201ccrisis.\u201dThere is already growing concern that tighter mortgage regulations and other recent changes may have overshot, given last year\u2019s plunge in transactions. Demand measures are blunt instruments that apply to all markets regardless of affordability, and disproportionately affect low-income households and youth. Supply measures, in comparison, allow markets to continue growing, albeit at a more sustainable pace.We have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable costToronto, along with Vancouver on the Pacific coast, has the lowest price elasticity of any urban market in Canada, meaning supply is the most out of sync with demand, according to a report last year from the federal housing agency.Developers agree. It takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association. The group estimates the GTA needs 50,000 new units a year to meet projected demand, but only about 40,000 are being built on average.\u201cThe issue in our view for the sharp rise in prices and the affordability issue fundamentally is the supply side not being able to adjust quickly enough to demand,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cSo a big part of the solution is on the supply side. Except you have to be more patient, because it takes a while.\u201d He said Clark\u2019s proposals \u201d are the right types of measures\u201d to ensure market imbalances get addressed more quickly.It\u2019s unclear how Clark\u2019s reforms would affect one major contributor to supply bottlenecks: delays to infrastructure projects such as highways and sewer systems. The minister\u2019s proposed changes to the growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the swath of cities surrounding Toronto that\u2019s home to a quarter of Canada\u2019s population, deal more with speeding up development approvals and updating zoning and intensification targets, rather than streamlining infrastructure regulations that are seen as excessive and unpredictable.The previous government\u2019s focus on policy ideas just ended up \u201cgrinding things down to a halt,\u201d said Joe Vaccaro, chief executive officer at the Ontario Home Builders\u2019 Association. He\u2019s calling on Ford to \u201cclear the decks and get things moving again\u201d by making decisions on several stalled infrastructure projects.One of those is the Upper York Sewage Solutions Project, a $715 million (US$541 million) wastewater treatment system that was supposed to service 30,000 new homes in three towns in York Region, a municipality of about 1.1 million people north of Toronto.Mike Rabeau, director of capital planning in the region\u2019s environmental services division, began work on the environmental assessment in 2009. Five years and $25 million later, he submitted the 16,000 page report to Ontario\u2019s environment ministry, expecting a decision within eight months. More than four years later, he\u2019s still waiting.\u201cIf you can\u2019t flush a toilet, you can\u2019t build a home,\u201d Rabeau said by phone, adding the expected project completion date is now 2026 at the earliest.After early signals the project would be approved, environment ministry officials told Rabeau in late 2016 there were some outstanding issues concerning the duty to consult indigenous groups. Discussions between these groups, the provincial government and York Region are ongoing, according to a ministry spokesman.The delay is typical of a broader problem with building infrastructure in the GTA. \u201cWe\u2019re growing at a fairly rapid rate, and we\u2019ve got this conundrum that infrastructure has to go through quite a complex approval process,\u201d James McKellar, a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University, said in a phone interview. \u201cOur ability to bring infrastructure online in a timely way just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dMichael Fenn, a former Ontario deputy minister and a visiting fellow at the Ivey Business School\u2019s Lawrence National Centre, says housing should be given particular emphasis when it comes to infrastructure development. \u201cKeeping housing of a variety of types affordable and available is crucial to the economic success\u201d of the GTA and the country generally, he said.Clark acknowledges housing supply is a \u201cvery complex problem,\u201d and he stopped short of saying the environment minister should approve the York sewage project. He nevertheless understands the municipality\u2019s frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of something that, if you talk to the region, is taking way too long to get approved,\u201d he said.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Melinda Grenier.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Top-performing hedge fund is shorting Canadian banks on all the usual suspects \u2014 and something even more worrying", "description": "Outside the financial sector, 80% of Canadian companies aren't generating enough cash to support their businesses, says Crescat", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/a-top-performing-hedge-fund-is-shorting-canada-banks-on-housing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/banks-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 18, 2019 9:21 AM EST", "content": "A small U.S. hedge fund that was a top performer last year is shorting Canadian banks.Crescat Capital sees the Canadian economy heading for recession as the housing market buckles. That might be bad enough for the banks but they face an added strain: outside the financial sector, more than 80 per cent of Canadian companies aren\u2019t generating enough cash to support their businesses, the highest in the world, according to Crescat.\u201cCanadian banks will be left holding the bag and the ones to suffer from what is likely to be a major economic recession,\u201d Tavi Costa, a global macro analyst at Denver-based Crescat, said by phone.Crescat has only US$55 million under management, but it returned 41 per cent in its Global Macro Fund last year and 32 per cent in its Long/Short Fund, bolstered by a short wager on China, according to its website. That put the company among the top performers in a year in which the industry saw its biggest loss since 2011, declining 4.1 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.The country\u2019s biggest lenders are Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, along with Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada. Costa declined to name the banks Crescat was shorting. Representatives for Canada\u2019s six biggest banks didn\u2019t immediately comment or declined to comment.Crescat\u2019s short comes amid long-standing warnings from economists, investors and even the Bank of Canada about elevated consumer debt, which was driven higher by a decades-long housing boom. Canada\u2019s ratio of household debt to income has been hovering at about 175 per cent for the past two years, compared with a peak of about 134 per cent in the U.S. at the height of its housing bubble in 2007.Now Canada\u2019s housing market is beginning to cool. Sales plunged 32 per cent in Vancouver last year and 16 per cent in Toronto amid rising interest rates, stricter mortgage rules and new taxes.\u201cChina is in the process of reversing its key role as a driver of global economic growth,\u201d the 29-year-old Costa said. \u201cCountries like Canada and Australia, and their respective housing markets, are the economies most vulnerable in this scenario.\u201dMeanwhile, Crescat calculates that about 80 per cent of Canadian non-financial stocks have been cash-flow negative in the past 12 months, which he measures as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.That may be inflated by the the large numbers of \u201czombie\u201d companies on Canadian stock exchanges, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines as those 10 years and older and whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to cover interest payments on their debts. In a September study, Deloitte found 16 per cent of public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its sister Venture Exchange are considered zombies, compared with 10 per cent globally.Cash flow in the energy sector may have been hammered by a slump in crude prices in the past year.But Costa said even if he excludes energy and materials stocks, 70 per cent of Canadian stocks have still lost money on a free cash-flow basis. If you consider only non-financial stocks with a market value of more than $100 million, the share is still more than 50 per cent, he said.\u201cHow is it sustainable for companies that generate no cash to continue to employ people?\u201d Costa said. \u201cMany of these troubled companies would be bankrupt under tighter monetary conditions.\u201dThe country\u2019s biggest lenders could face troubles on both the housing and corporate fronts, according to Costa.At their peak last year, the six largest banks, traded at an average of 1.9 times book value, a similar valuation to U.S. banks prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, according to Costa. He expects that to drop to 0.7 times book value or so, where U.S. banks were trading post-financial crisis.Other investors have recommended shorting Canadian financials on a looming housing correction in the past, including Steve Eisman, who predicted the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse.And Canadians bank stocks have largely defied naysayers as the country\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered near records lows amid steady growth \u2014 until recently. The S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks Index slumped 11 per cent last year amid market global volatility, the biggest decline since 2008.\u201cMost of these banks are off their highs and have just started to break down,\u201d Costa said.With assistance from Doug Alexander and Brandon Kochkodin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Davide Scigliuzzo, Eliza Ronalds-Hannon and Lauren Coleman-Lochner", "title": "Sears to stay in business after Eddie Lampert\u2019s hedge fund wins bankruptcy auction", "description": "Lampert's bid prevailed over competing proposals from liquidators that would have forced the chain to shut down and sell its assets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/sears-to-stay-in-business-after-eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-wins-bankruptcy-auction", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/sears-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2019 11:33 AM EST", "content": "Eddie Lampert, the dogged billionaire who\u2019s hitched his career and reputation to a fading American retail icon, will get another chance at reviving Sears Holdings Corp.In an agreement reached in the wee hours of Wednesday in New York, Lampert won a bankruptcy auction with a plan that will keep the bankrupt company in business and save thousands of jobs, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The agreement still needs to be approved by the U.S. judge overseeing the bankruptcy.Lampert\u2019s offer prevailed over competing proposals from liquidators that would have forced the 126-year-old department-store chain to shut down and sell its assets. The bid is valued at over US$5 billion and represents an improvement of more than US$150 million over the hedge fund manager\u2019s previous offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.The agreement caps two days of discussions behind closed doors to determine whether Sears would be worth more dead or alive. Sticking points had included whether Lampert, the former chief executive officer and current chairman, should be insulated from lawsuits over his previous turnaround deals for the company, Bloomberg previously reported. The final agreement doesn\u2019t include such a release for Lampert, the people said.Representatives for Sears Holdings and for ESL Investments Inc., the hedge fund run by Lampert that made the offer, declined to comment.ESL is Sears\u2019s biggest shareholder and creditor. Lampert now faces the challenge of returning a slimmed-down version of the company to profitability after billions of losses under his management.

One hundred years ago, the company leveraged the newest technology \u2014 the U.S. postal system \u2014 to become the Amazon.com of the 20th century.The retailer boomed in the decades after the Second World War along with a growing middle class. But it wasn\u2019t able to keep up with shifting consumer habits as online rivals including Amazon.com Inc. siphoned off shoppers, while turnaround efforts were hobbled by mountains of debt.Sears lost its footing in the 1980s with expansions into financial products such as banking, mortgages, insurance and credit cards. Walmart Stores Inc. supplanted Sears as the biggest retailer in the early 1990s.Since 2009, the number of Sears stores has fallen from 3,900 including Kmart to 866 at the time of its October bankruptcy filing. Kmart hasn\u2019t thrived either, shrinking its store count by about two-thirds in the past 10 years.The winning bid is the latest in Lampert\u2019s long list of manoeuvres to turn the company around.

Home sales in the Toronto region fell 16 per cent in 2018, while in Vancouver they plunged 32 per cent. Recent weakness in oil prices, meanwhile, could have spillover effects on the real estate markets in energy producing regions.The central bank revised down its expectations for the sector, which it now expects to shrink in 2019 after previously forecasting a small gain.Softness in interest-rate sensitive segments of the economy goes beyond housing. Spending on durable goods also dragged on third quarter growth. Auto sales fell on an annual basis for the first time since 2009, and analysts expect another retreat in 2019. The Bank of Canada revised consumption down, and now projects it to add just 1 percentage point to growth this year, which would be its weakest contribution since the 2009 recession.The Bank of Canada\u2019s \u201centire chop\u201d to projected 2019 growth \u2014 from 2.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent \u2014 is attributable to lower domestic demand, Bank of Montreal\u2019s Chief Economist Douglas Porter said Wednesday.All this talk of more rate increases suggests policy makers may not fully appreciate the impact they\u2019re having on the economy, according to David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates. \u201cThe bank has over-tightened as it is,\u201d Rosenberg said Wednesday on BNN Bloomberg, adding he believes the hiking cycle has come to an end and it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if the next move was a cut.To be sure, the central bank is clearly aware of the issue, acknowledging Wednesday the economy may be more sensitive to higher rates than initially thought. It seems to be in no rush to hike, and it elevated developments in the nation\u2019s housing market to one of the three key factors that will determine the pace of policy normalization after data showed it \u201cslowed markedly.\u201d That\u2019s a shift from December, when Poloz described housing as \u201cstabilizing.\u201d It also stressed that any future move would be entirely data dependent.Still, the Bank of Canada estimates neutral rates of interest are somewhere between 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, which implies at least three more hikes from the current 1.75 per cent policy rate. But markets don\u2019t see Poloz even getting within 50 basis points of the midpoint of that range within the next five years, according to the overnight index swaps curve.There are too many unknowns about how the housing market will react to the cocktail of measures working to slow it down, said George Pearkes, chief macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group.\u201cWhen it\u2019s all combined with high prices at the same time, prudence is certainly warranted,\u201d Pearkes said.With assistance from Eric LamBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "RBC's CEO vows improvement on bank's disappointing mortgage performance", "description": "David McKay says the bank lost market share but has addressed 'deficiencies'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/rbcs-ceo-vows-improvement-to-disappointing-mortgage-performance", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mckay-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 11, 2019 11:04 AM EST", "content": "Royal Bank of Canada Chief Executive Officer David McKay is vowing to do better on Canadian mortgages after a couple years of disappointing performance.\u201cWe competed poorly in 2017 and \u201918 in the mortgage space,\u201d McKay, 55, said at the RBC Capital Markets Canadian Bank CEO Conference in Toronto on Tuesday. \u201cWe lost market share.\u201dMargins in the domestic mortgage business \u201cwere challenged\u201d and the market was \u201csuper competitive\u201d last year, McKay said.

Rules on multiple home purchases, or how soon a property can be sold once it\u2019s bought, are starting to be relaxed, and there are giveaways galore as home builders try to lure buyers.One developer in September was giving away a BMW Series 3 or X1 to anyone wishing to purchase a three-bedroom unit or townhouse at its project in Shanghai. Down-payments have also been slashed, with China Evergrande Group asking for just 5 per cent compared with the usual 30 per cent deposit required.\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to see Beijing and Shanghai residential prices fall given the curbing policies currently on these two markets,\u201d said Henry Chin, head of research at CBRE Group Inc. An index that measures second-hand home prices in Beijing has been falling since September while one that tracks Shanghai has been on the decline now for almost 12 months, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "The year higher borrowing costs and stricter mortgage rules hit home", "description": "Toronto, Vancouver housing sales plummet to decade-lows in 2018", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-vancouver-housing-sales-plummet-to-decade-lows-in-2018?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/toronto-vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 4, 2019 8:22 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s priciest housing markets saw their worst year for sales in at least a decade as higher borrowing costs and stricter mortgage rules hit home.Sales in the Toronto region fell 16 per cent to 77,426 transactions in 2018 while the average price fell 4.3 per cent to $787,300, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Friday. That\u2019s the worst year for sales in Canada\u2019s biggest city since 2008. In Vancouver, full-year sales fell 32 per cent to 24,619, the lowest since 2000 and 25 per cent below the 10-year average.\u201cHigher borrowing costs coupled with the new mortgage stress test certainly prompted some households to temporarily move to the sidelines to reassess their housing options,\u201d Garry Bhaura, president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, said in a statement.Sales in both cities took a dive in the first half of 2018 after the federal government imposed tougher qualifying rules for mortgages. Vancouver sales continued to suffer even while Toronto began to recover in the second half, as the British Columbia government introduced more measures to deter speculation.In December, Toronto sales fell 23 per cent to 3,781 from the same month in 2017. The drop was likely exaggerated by buyers rushing in last year to beat the new rules. Vancouver had the weakest December for sales in a decade, falling 47 per cent to 1,072 transactions from a year earlier.Homeowners staying put rather than attempting to cash on previous gains appear to be a factor in the decline in sales in Toronto with new listings down 13 per cent for the year and 32 per cent in December.The benchmark price, which measures the value of a typical home, rose 3 per cent to $764,200 in December from a year ago in Toronto. The condo sector performed strongest, with benchmark prices jumping 9 per cent while e of a detached home was little changed at $907,900.

They say November was their busiest on record, and December \u2014 typically a slow time of year in the insolvency trade \u2014 hasn\u2019t let up.\u201cI\u2019m essentially trying to add capacity every day to get people seen,\u201d Blair Mantin, a Vancouver-based licensed insolvency trustee at Sands & Associates, said by phone. \u201cUsually things slow down around Christmas, but we haven\u2019t seen the demand slow down this year.\u201dThe interviews, while anecdotal, add to recent indications rate hikes are beginning to take a toll, and suggest insolvencies may keep rising. The latest official data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies showed the rate of consumer insolvencies rose 9.4 per cent in October on an annual basis, the most since 2016.Insolvency data can be volatile, but it appears Canadian consumers are at an inflection point. \u201cThe tide has turned, and the water\u2019s starting to rise,\u201d Ted Michalos, a licensed insolvency trustee at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cNow it\u2019s just a question of how quickly does it rise.\u201dThe effects of higher borrowing costs are beginning to be felt broadly. Vehicle sales, among the sectors most sensitive to rising rates, fell the most since 2009, while growth in residential mortgages decelerated to the slowest pace since 1982, worrying signs for an economy so reliant on consumption.The tide has turned, and the water's starting to rise. Now it's just a question of how quickly does it riseIn addition, liabilities are eating up a bigger share of disposable income. Canada\u2019s debt service ratio climbed to 14.51 on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, the highest since 2008, the federal statistics agency reported last week.Hoyes, Michalos \u2014 which usually accounts for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of insolvency filings in Ontario \u2014 just had its busiest November since opening in 1999. The insolvency trustee and debt relief agency received 1,000 new inquiries, compared with 650 in November 2017, and initiated 384 new filings, surpassing the previous high of 350 in November 2009. Through the first 10 days of December, Michalos said the firm\u2019s numbers are up 57 per cent from a year earlier.Lower gasoline prices aren\u2019t fully offsetting higher mortgage costs, and \u201cthere is very little room in many Canadians\u2019 budgets to absorb these increased costs,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s also seeing more clients with so-called installment loans, basically large, high-interest payday loans that can be paid off over a longer period.Mantin, whose Vancouver-based firm recorded it\u2019s biggest year-over-year increase in filings in November since he joined eight years ago, also cited an increase in large payday loans among his clients. He said previously it would have been typical to see payday loans of $500 (US$373) or $1,000. Now he sometimes sees \u201cinstallment loans\u201d of $15,000.Higher rates are hitting at a time when consumers are already struggling to cope with the recent housing boom. Mantin says the majority of clients in the firm\u2019s downtown Vancouver office pay 50 per cent or more of their income in rent, \u201cand you can only do that for so long,\u201d he said. Other clients are young families who overextended themselves at the peak of the boom, often tapping home equity to make renovations, and now can\u2019t sell.Grant Bazian, president at MNP Ltd., said November was the agency\u2019s busiest ever, with year-over-year growth in filings of about 12 per cent. For December, \u201cit looks like the trend is holding up,\u201d putting MNP on pace for a record fourth quarter, he said.\u201cThe biggest driver of the increased filings appears to be rising interest rates,\u201d Bazian said by phone from Vancouver. \u201cPeople just get in over their heads.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has raised rates five times since mid-2017, and Governor Stephen Poloz has said he\u2019s watching the economy closely to gauge the effects. Investors are increasingly sure the bank will proceed more slowly, with implied odds showing one more increase over the next 12 months. In October, the expectation was for three more.David Lewis, an Edmonton-based board member at the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, which represents about 1,000 insolvency professionals, said higher borrowing costs are already having an impact.\u201cMost of our membership believe that it\u2019s not a blip, that we will see an uptick in numbers just because of the interest rates rising,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cPeople are finding they can\u2019t deal with the debt month to month, that they could have dealt with six or eight months ago because they\u2019re paying extra interest on it all.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto condo party to sober up in 2019, developers say, but don't expect prices to go down", "description": "Developers may be cautious short-term, but are confident prices will continue to rise longer term due to supply constraints and Toronto's growth prospects", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-condo-party-likely-to-sober-up-in-2019-developers-say", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 18, 2018 11:17 AM EST", "content": "After a three-year non-stop party, Toronto\u2019s condo market is likely to settle down in 2019, some of the city\u2019s biggest developers say.\u201cI can\u2019t, for a minute, imagine that we\u2019re going to continue to see the increases that we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d said Jim Ritchie, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Tridel. \u201cDo I think there\u2019s still room for growth? Yes, but not what we\u2019ve seen in the past three years.\u201dRitchie joined representatives from Menkes Developments Ltd., CentreCourt Inc. and Diamond Kilmer Developments for a round table discussion at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto offices on the outlook for the city\u2019s condo market last week. Together, the closely held companies have built more than 100,000 condo units, including Menkes\u2019 Harbour Plaza and Tridel\u2019s Ten York by the waterfront.Toronto condo prices have surged 50 per cent in the past three years to a record high of $570,764 (US$425,000) in September, according to research firm Urbanation Inc. The segment soared amid the housing frenzy in the first half of 2017. While price gains have eased since then, they remain buoyant compared with the single-home segment which has been hit by harsher mortgage lending rules and rising interest rates.\u201cWe have hit the peak and I think prices will probably stay flat, for, I would even say the next two years,\u201d said Jane Renwick, vice president of marketing and sales at Diamond Kilmer Developments, a joint venture between Diamond Corp. and Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund. The group is developing its first project of about 250,000 square feet of housing in mid-rise condos and townhouses that will include a mix of market and affordable units.Shamez Virani, president at CentreCourt, added: \u201cThere is, for the first time in a little while, at least in the last 24 months, signs of resistance, signs of certain projects not being able to break barriers on pricing.\u201dAdditional condo cancellations are also likely due to rising construction costs that could offset revenue from presales and pressure margins, the developers said. Costs have increased across the board, including steel, due to tariffs, labour, municipal charges and land.This year, 15 buildings with more than 4,500 units have been cancelled, Urbanation said. That compares with 1,678 for 2017 and 379 for 2016.I promise you, pricing is going up\u201cWe\u2019ve seen cost inflation in the construction space being in the range of 10 per cent this past year, which is something we hadn\u2019t seen previously,\u201d Virani said. \u201cThe theme of 2019 is about protecting your market, about ensuring that you\u2019re really being thoughtful about the timing and the allocation of costs, and selling and building in the same market environment so you don\u2019t get caught in that situation where you\u2019re forced to cancel a project.\u201dWhile the developers may be cautious short-term, all are confident that prices will continue to rise longer term due to supply constraints and Toronto\u2019s growth prospects. Gross domestic product in the city of 2.8 million people has been running at about 3.4 per cent for the past three years, above its population growth of 1.6 per cent, according to a city report.Jared Menkes, executive vice president of high-rise residential at Menkes Developments was unwavering for the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of red tape that\u2019s slowing down bringing more product to market,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cI promise you, pricing is going up.\u201dBelow are additional insights on what to expect in 2019:Jared Menkes on condo sales outlook in 2019:\u201cI think 2019, you\u2019re going be putting in more work just like for 2018 \u2014 it\u2019s not like it was 2016 or 2017, where you just opened the door and there\u2019s a line up around the block. It\u2019s rolling up your sleeves, telling the story, explaining the value proposition, the reasons to buying into this location.\u201dShamez Virani on shift to suburbs:\u201cThe big part of the solution is the 905. Municipalities like Vaughn, Mississauga, Markham and Richmond Hill are all municipalities that have realized that because of price appreciation, all of a sudden, there is development potential on a lot of their land. They\u2019re realizing that the City of Toronto is slowly closing the taps to new development and they\u2019re going to be the beneficiaries of it, so there\u2019s been this really meaningful shift in the last two years for developers to really go into the 905.\u201dJim Ritchie on condo price growth opportunities:\u201cThere are opportunities in 2019 where there could be reasonably good price increases depending on the product and where it is. There are some parts in our city that have a lot more competition and are building very similar product lines, maybe in that particular circumstance, we\u2019re not going to see as much inflation, but you really have to break it out and look at it.\u201dJane Renwick on affordable housing:\u201cBefore, development didn\u2019t happen east of Yonge because of Regent Park and Moss Park and where we had these areas where we had a concentration of social housing as opposed to it being integrated among market housing. So I think the best way to go is to integrate it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Toronto new home prices see biggest 12-month drop in more than two decades", "description": "Further evidence that tighter mortgage lending has slowed a boom in Canada's biggest city", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/toronto-new-home-prices-post-biggest-12-month-drop-since-1996", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/canada-house-price.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 13, 2018 9:13 AM EST", "content": "Toronto new home prices fell at the fastest pace in more than two decades in October, further evidence that tighter mortgage lending has slowed a boom in Canada\u2019s biggest city.Statistics Canada\u2019s price index for new Toronto homes fell 1.4 per cent in October from a year earlier, the most since September 1996.

The Canadian Home Builders\u2019 Association said the rules are hitting millennials and struggling markets like Calgary particularly hard.The rules, put in place in January, require even those with a 20 per cent down payment, who don\u2019t need mortgage insurance, to prove that they can make payments at 2 percentage points above the contracted rate.

It\u2019s been achieved so it\u2019s kind of overkill now.\u201dAs rates rise \u201cthey\u2019re doing their natural job and that 2 per cent spread, we certainly hope the government will either remove it or at least cap it,\u201d Carr said. Peter Gilgan, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Mattamy Homes, added that a reduction to 1.5 per cent or 1 per cent would make sense.\u201cIdeally at this point the best thing would be for the new stress test to be repealed, just removed,\u201d David Foster, director of communications at the CHBA said. \u201cMarkets like Calgary, they\u2019re already quite soft, are just hammered by this.\u201dFoster said the restrictions are disproportionately affecting young first-time buyers and the longer the rules are in place the more disenfranchised that age cohort is going to be. The stress tests also perversely tend to push people into open variable rate mortgages or the non-regulated space, neither of which are without significant risk to the borrower, he said.A spokeswoman for the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions said it wasn\u2019t able to immediately respond.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "'We're at a crisis and we don't even realize it': The dark side of Toronto's housing boom", "description": "Affordable housing is almost impossible to find as tighter mortgage rules and a surge in immigrants has created an all-out war for rentals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-lottery-with-501-odds-reveals-dark-side-of-toronto-boom?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/regent-park.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 26, 2018 3:48 PM EST", "content": "Debbie Ross has the same chance of snagging an affordable apartment in Toronto as she does picking a long-shot at the Kentucky Derby.Ross is hoping to win one of 75 rental apartments in a lottery run by the city\u2019s public housing agency. She\u2019s up against 3,779 others, so the odds of winning are only about 50:1 but figures it\u2019s as good a chance as any of finding a place to live.Long priced out of home ownership, Ross is now being squeezed out of the rental market as the country\u2019s biggest population boom since 1957 sends prices surging in Canada\u2019s biggest city.The 56-year-old unemployed office worker pays $1,026 (US$776) for her one-bedroom apartment. Her savings and unemployment insurance are running out and she\u2019s been looking for a cheaper place but units that were in her price range only a few years ago have nearly doubled.\u201cIt\u2019s so stressful and I suffer from heart palpitations and anxiety,\u201d said Ross from her 24th-floor apartment where hanging plants and bright cushions create a refuge in a dingy building in constant combat with pest infestations.As U.S. President Donald Trump has clamped down on high-tech visas and amped up the anti-immigration rhetoric Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a more welcoming approach. Canada took in a record 413,000 people from abroad in the year through July 1, pushing population growth to 1.4 per cent, the fastest in the Group of Seven.Almost 100,000 of those immigrants have landed in Toronto in the past year, including refugee claimants, a surge in international students and workers chasing thousands of new high-tech jobs at companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Add in those who can\u2019t meet stricter mortgage regulations after house prices jumped 60 per cent in the past five years and it\u2019s been an all out war for rentals.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point now where given the amount of people, industries we\u2019re attracting, we are already becoming terribly unaffordable for everyone,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of several books on urban issues. \u201cWe\u2019re at a crisis and we don\u2019t even realize it: Our transit, traffic problem and housing problem are urgent matters.\u201dSupply isn\u2019t beginning to keep up. Condo completions have been running near a five-year low of about 10,000 units, according to Altus Group Ltd. And only about 60 purpose-built rental buildings have been constructed since 2005, bringing a meager 11,620 units to market when the city\u2019s been creating about 17,000 renter households a year, according to property research firm Urbanation Inc.The result has been skyrocketing prices. Condo rents soared 7.6 per cent to an average $2,385 in the third quarter over the same period a year ago and were up 17 per cent for newly available purpose-built units, according to data from Urbanation. Meanwhile, the apartment vacancy rate sits at about 0.5 per cent.Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,That might still be a bargain compared with cities like San Francisco, where a one-bedroom went for US$3,333 in 2017 or New York where it cost US$2,811, though prices in those cities have stabilized over the past year.Those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder are getting hit the hardest.\u201cHomelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,\u201d said Alejandra Ruiz Vargas, a member at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now Canada, which represents low and moderate-income families.With asylum claims to Canada also doubling in the past year, it\u2019s getting harder for refugees to find housing too, said Lucy Chaimiti, executive director at Adam House, a refugee support group. It usually takes people four to six months to find housing after arriving in the city and they usually end up spending about 85 per cent of their social assistance income on housing, she said.City and provincial policymakers are beginning to wake up to the brewing affordability crisis. In an election dominated by housing last month, Mayor John Tory pledged to bring 40,000 affordable rental units to the city over the next decade, offering city land, cash incentives and to cancel or defer development charges and taxes.While there are rent controls on existing units, the new provincial government has dropped them on new construction in an effort to entice development. Some builders such as Tricon Capital Group Inc. have already jumped on the affordable bandwagon.Affordable housing needs to be created for those who \u201care not investment bankers or cannabis entrepreneurs,\u201d RioCan REIT Chief Executive Officer Ed Sonshine said in an earnings call in October. RioCan is interested in getting into the market, but government incentives needs to be higher, he said in a phone interview.Toronto meanwhile, needs to get more creative to broaden the types of housing available, said Florida, at University of Toronto. Companies could focus on housing that uses pre-treated timber or modular construction, speedier, cheaper home-building alternatives.\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting priced out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy students at the Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto, who are going to be some of the most successful students in Canadian business, are now saying it\u2019s doubtful they could ever afford a single-family home.\u201dMeanwhile, Ross is running out of options as she scrambles to secure future housing. She\u2019s anxiously awaiting to hear back from the lottery which is offering up a one-bedroom unit for $962 including utilities in the redeveloped Regent Park. The former crack haven is now a mixed-used neighbourhood that includes affordable rentals and market-priced condos alongside sports fields, an aquatic centre, community meeting spaces and cafes.The city will likely need dozens of such neighbourhoods to handle the influx in newcomers.At one point, Ross even called a shelter to see what her options would be if she was kicked out of her apartment. \u201cThey said you have to call weeks in advance.
