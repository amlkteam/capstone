Druckenmiller on Tuesday called a V-shaped recovery \u2014 the idea the economy will quickly snap back as the coronavirus pandemic eases \u2014 a \u201cfantasy.\u201d Tepper said Wednesday that next to 1999, equities are overvalued the most he\u2019s ever seen.It\u2019s a notion catching on among Wall Street money managers. And it\u2019s coming as investors start to suspect that the Federal Reserve\u2019s support, as well as US$3 trillion in Treasury stimulus, may not be enough to compensate for soaring unemployment, a wave of bankruptcies and no end in sight to the pandemic. Managers including Bill Miller, Paul Singer and Paul Tudor Jones have all voiced doubts about markets or the economy.Such bearishness starkly contrasts with the optimism that pushed the S&P 500 Index up 26 per cent from its March low. And the warnings have caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who\u2019s facing re-election and has seen his plans to run on a booming economy shredded by the virus. Trump attacked \u201cso-called \u2018rich guys\u2019\u201d in a tweet Wednesday.\u201cYou must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down,\u201d Trump wrote about the stock market. \u201cThen they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways.\u201dWhen the so-called \u201crich guys\u201d speak negatively about the market, you must always remember that some are betting big against it, and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive, get big publicity, and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?His criticism is unlikely to sway Wall Street professionals. The S&P 500 Index is down 3.8 per cent this week, and investors and economists are forecasting further declines amid a prolonged struggle to right the economy.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Trump\u2019s pick for the job, outlined a doom-laden scenario with mass bankruptcies and unemployment in a speech delivered around the same time as the president\u2019s tweet. Powell said policymakers may have to do more to prevent long-term damage to the economy.Tepper\u2019s comments were a change from late March, when he said he was \u201cnibbling\u201d at stocks, buying into companies focused on technology or hospitals and health care. Tepper, who runs the US$13-billion Appaloosa hedge fund, told CNBC on Wednesday that valuations are \u201cnuts\u201d for some individual stocks on the Nasdaq. He also highlighted banks and airlines as difficult areas in which to invest right now.Druckenmiller said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York that his analysis showed liquidity that drove markets higher will soon shrink as Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases. The 66-year-old said he\u2019s never seen a time when the risk of owning stocks so outweighed the potential gain.When reached by phone on Wednesday, billionaire Leon Cooperman pointed to an email he wrote in late April that predicted the government\u2019s actions to combat the pandemic will lead to higher taxes and more regulation. He estimated the S&P 500 should be trading lower \u2014 somewhere between 2,200 to 2,800 \u2014 which suggests stocks could fall as much as 22 per cent.\u201cI\u2019m 77 years old and I\u2019ve never seen this level of uncertainty,\u201d Cooperman said in the phone interview. \u201cThis cycle is different than the other seven bear market cycles I lived through because this is the only one where we had a broad scale shut down of the economy, which I view as a mistake.\u201dI'm 77 years old and I've never seen this level of uncertaintyCooperman warned that the longer the economy remains shut, the greater the risk of a depression.Other marquee investors also have taken more defensive stances recently. Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment Corp., told clients in early May he was investing in gold and had even put a small percentage of his firm\u2019s assets in Bitcoin as he looked for havens. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn said in late April that he wasn\u2019t buying stocks. Instead, he was hoarding cash and shorting commercial real estate.Stock-picker Miller said in an email he\u2019s changed his mind about the market\u2019s prospects for the near future.\u201cThe buying opportunity I talked about on CNBC on March 18 did not last as long as I thought it would,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAfter being up about 30 per cent from the low on March 23, I would think a pause and some consolidation is in order.\u201d He predicted the S&P 500 could fall 4 per cent or 5 per cent from its current level.A few of the more bearish hedge fund managers already sounded the alarm earlier this year. Crispin Odey told clients in a March update that \u201cnothing is immune from the slowdown.\u201d\u201cBy all means buy your favourite shares, I am not going to put you off,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut know that from here on you are now on the wrong side of history.\u201dSinger, the founder of Elliott Management, who on Feb. 1 told his staff to prepare for quarantines, told clients in mid-April \u2014 while stocks were soaring \u2014 that the outlook for equities was dire. Global stock markets could fall 50 per cent or more from their February top, he said.It\u2019s not just fund managers. Billionaire Mark Cuban, who is part of a group chosen by Trump last month to help advise on reopening the economy, said he agreed with Druckenmiller about equities.\u201cStocks are overvalued and the risk-reward isn\u2019t there till we see a cohesive plan for testing from the government,\u201d Cuban said in an email.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boesler and Craig Torres", "title": "Fed\u2019s Jerome Powell warns coronavirus could do lasting damage to economy; policy makers will need to do more", "description": "The Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/powell-says-virus-poses-lasting-harm-more-may-need-to-be-done", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/jerome-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 13, 2020 9:41 AM EDT", "content": "The U.S. economy faces unprecedented downside risks that could do lasting damage to households and businesses if fiscal and monetary policy makers don\u2019t rise to the challenge, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said.\u201cThe recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,\u201d Powell said Wednesday in remarks prepared for a virtual event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAdditional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.\u201dPowell and his colleagues on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee have taken dramatic measures to shelter the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic. They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell\u2019s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in MarchThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.\u201cLong stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.\u201dWhile the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksCongressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank\u2019s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.\u201cWhile the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,\u201d Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would \u201ccontinue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,\u201d but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.\u201cWhen this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth", "title": "Stocks tumble after double whammy of warnings from Fauci and Fed over pandemic economy", "description": "Central bank officials cited risk of the potential for massive bankruptcies that could create a lasting scar", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/european-stocks-gain-while-u-s-futures-edge-lower-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fearless-girl.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 4:33 AM EDT", "content": "Stocks tumbled after a U.S. official warned against a premature reopening of the economy amid a dire outlook from Federal Reserve regional chiefs.

A key measure of U.S. consumer prices declined last month by the most on record. A sustained trend of declining prices would spur worries about deflation, exacerbating concern that the recovery from the deep economic downturn will be very slow.Buyers of U.S. stocks after the economy shrank in the first quarter have history on their side, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth Management. Gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, marking the 13th quarterly decline of more than 4 per cent since 1949, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

In total, more than $10 billion of mergers, acquisitions and investments have been terminated in the past seven days, the data show, with many more under threat as acquirers try to back out of agreements or renegotiate terms.Real Estate CrumblesReal estate deals have been particularly hard hit, with deals falling apart across the residential and travel sectors as millions of Americans face unemployment and tourists stay home.South Korea\u2019s Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. on Sunday terminated its $5.8 billion purchase of 15 luxury hotels from an affiliate of Anbang Insurance Group Co. The portfolio included the JW Marriott Essex House, overlooking Central Park in New York City, and the Four Seasons in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.\u201cIt will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men\u2019s jobs affected,\u201d according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers \u2014 where many women work \u2014 is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a \u201cshe-cession,\u201d April\u2019s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Brendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday\u2019s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn\u2019t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. \u201cThe hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,\u201d Bernard said by phone.While Friday\u2019s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it\u2019s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.\u201cThat\u2019s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cThe job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.\u201dThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won\u2019t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.\u201cOnce things start to return to normal, it\u2019s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,\u201d Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.\u201cWe are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,\u201d Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jordan Fabian and Mario Parker", "title": "'Will some people be affected badly?

Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soonAs governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he\u2019s pivoting to \u201cphase two\u201d of the nation\u2019s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.\u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201dOn his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as \u201cwarriors\u201d as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was \u201cthe biggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make.\u201dAnd while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.\u201cThere\u2019ll be more death,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we\u2019re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it\u2019s going to pass, and we\u2019re going to be back to normal.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s been a rough process. There is no question about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think our economy is going to be raging\u201d next year, he added.While in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done \u201csafely.\u201dYet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d and Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019s version of \u201cLive and Let Die.\u201dSenior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn\u2019t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that \u201cdoctors\u201d he didn\u2019t name had advised him to close the economy \u201cfor a couple of years.\u201d\u201cI created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. \u201cAnd then one day they said, \u2018we have to close our country.\u2019 Well, now it\u2019s time to open up.\u201dPublic-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a \u201cfire\u201d that could be extinguished \u201cfast.\u201dHe also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriors\u201cThese models have been so wrong from day one.

That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It\u2019s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it\u2019s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services.Labor market destruction isn\u2019t unique to Canada.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.That will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Despite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Consumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maria Jose Valero", "title": "Shopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge", "description": "One analyst says near-record valuation 'somewhat surprising' given uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-too-hot-to-handle-for-some-analysts-after-latest-surge?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc.\u2019s $38-billion (US$27 billion) stock-market gain since the beginning of the year has some analysts calling a time out.The e-commerce services provider has surged 61 per cent to a market value of $97 billion.

On the inside, it\u2019s a barren landscape. All 37 floors are empty.Office landlords in major cities around the world are facing a hit from the coronavirus. In Canada\u2019s energy capital, they\u2019re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and \u201ca huge crater\u201d in local government finances.It\u2019s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada\u2019s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade\u2019s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market\u2019s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there\u2019s an epic glut. Net asking rents \u2014 what the landlord receives \u2014 for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America\u2019s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Four buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.\u201cThe office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,\u201d said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.Canada\u2019s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers\u2019 ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time\u201cThere was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,\u201d said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Canada. \u201cWhereas now, it\u2019s been bust for a long time.\u201d His firm sees the city\u2019s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they\u2019re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,\u201d Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn\u2019t survive or deserted their leased space.The crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil\u2019s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary\u2019s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that\u2019s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar\u2019s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.\u201cThe question is, \u2018Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?\u2019\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kait Bolongaro", "title": "Price tag for aid to Canada's workers: $16 billion in one month", "description": "$8.4 billion has been sent to residents not eligible for jobless insurance through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/price-tag-for-aid-to-canadas-workers-c16-billion-in-one-month?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cerb-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 17, 2020 9:56 AM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government has delivered $16 billion (US$11.6 billion) in income support to workers over the past month, in what represents the first major instalment of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s stimulus package.The government has paid out $7.9 billion in unemployment insurance benefits from new claimants since March 16, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be identified because the figures are not public.

Her net worth has climbed US$8.2 billion to US$45.3 billion, and she\u2019s now No. 18 on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest person, and Mexico\u2019s Carlos Slim.Shares of rival retailer Walmart Inc. have also advanced, buoying the fortunes of the world\u2019s richest family. Alice, Jim and Rob Walton now have a combined net worth of US$169 billion, up almost 5 per cent since the start of the year.Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has added US$10.4 billion to his fortune this year, more than anyone except Bezos.The fortune of Zoom Video Communications Inc. founder Eric Yuan has more than doubled to US$7.4 billion, as demand for its teleconferencing service exploded in the wake of the pandemic-driven lockdown.\u201cThe unfairness of it all is who is going to benefit from it most,\u201d Maley said. \u201cMoney makes money.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith, Javier Blas and Salma El Wardany", "title": "Oil price war ends with historic OPEC+ deal for biggest output cut ever of 9.7 million barrels a day", "description": "The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/opec-agrees-largest-ever-oil-output-cut-of-9-7-mln-bpd-sources?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/opec-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2020 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s top oil producers pulled off a historic deal to cut global crude output and put an end to a devastating price war.After a week-long marathon of bilateral talks and four days of video conferences with government ministers from around the world, an agreement finally emerged to tackle the impact of the global pandemic on demand.The talks almost fell apart because of resistance from Mexico, but came back from the brink after a weekend of urgent diplomacy \u2014 with the clock ticking down to the market open.OPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day \u2014 just below the initial plan of 10 million. Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels \u2014 less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were \u201chorrifying.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn\u2019t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico\u2019s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20.

He graduated from Boston-based Emerson College in 2009, just as the Great Recession gutted the jobs market for years.He spent his first few years after school fighting for low-paid work as a production assistant. His mentors told him, \u201c\u2018Dude, you missed the good years by like five years,\u2019\u201d he said.A decade later, just as he had built up savings and was preparing to buy a house, the 31-year-old is out of a job again. The coronavirus outbreak has dried up production gigs in Hollywood, where he works.No age group will escape the pain of the current economic slowdown, but millennials were already on more precarious financial footing than their elders. They left college with unprecedented levels of student debt and missed out on crucial years of wage growth because of the 2008 downturn.Compared to other groups at the same point in their lives, people in their 20s and 30s have relatively low levels of home ownership, net worth and real income, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper.\u201cThey\u2019re walking a tight rope and there are cliffs on either side,\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine someone making it through both of these recessions in this age group really unscathed.\u201dEconomic downturns are inevitable, but they\u2019re not usually so severe. And once-in-a-generation recessions don\u2019t tend to occur just a decade apart.For millennials, the timing of these events has been particularly damaging. People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been \u201cmuch larger\u201d than previous downturns.Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person\u2019s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn\u2019t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They\u2019re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, \u201cI worry even more about the people without college diplomas.\u201dWhile white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.\u201cIt could be a problem if the unemployment stops,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201d\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201d\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201d\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201d\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan\u2019s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they\u2019re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home.\u201cWe\u2019ve stated many times that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. \u201cWe have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor\u2019s note.\u201dThose tensions aren\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It\u2019s the finance industry\u2019s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where \u201cessential\u201d workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Some investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it\u2019s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank\u2019s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn\u2019t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it\u2019s trying to be respectful of people\u2019s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.Traders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn\u2019t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked \u201cimportant\u201d last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. \u201cWe remain open,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDriving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.\u201d Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown \u2014 even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Most big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm\u2019s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor\u2019s note to work from home.Inside Natixis SA\u2019s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: \u201cHighly Confidential: COVID-19 \u2014 Staff Infection List.\u201dWorkers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.\u201cNatixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. \u201cWe have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees\u2019 health and help slow the propagation of the virus.\u201dMarket swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it\u2019s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York\u2019s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan\u2019s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank\u2019s global head of markets, \u201ccontinues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,\u201d Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna\u2019s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if they\u2019d been working from home.\u201cWith the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,\u201d Adragna wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET\u2019S GO.\u201dJPMorgan\u2019s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders\u2019 dealings. It isn\u2019t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven\u2019t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems \u201creasonably designed\u201d to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she\u2019s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she\u2019ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Wild Variations in Canadian Jobs Poll Reflect\u00a0Employment Chaos", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Economists are all over the map when it comes to predicting how badly Canada\u2019s labor market got whacked in March.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/wild-variations-in-canadian-jobs-poll-reflect-employment-chaos", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "April 5, 2020 11:13 AM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Economists are all over the map when it comes to predicting how badly Canada\u2019s labor market got whacked in March.

At the other end of the spectrum, 4CAST projects a net loss of 100,000, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. puts it at 175,000.Such disparity may reflect just how quickly the virus has overwhelmed Canada\u2019s economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government has rolled out massive fiscal support to encourage employers to keep workers on payrolls, but it\u2019s unclear how effective those programs will be.Prior to the pandemic, the biggest decline in Canadian employment was 125,000 in January 2009.Last month\u2019s potentially epic loss was foreshadowed by jobless claims that have already reached records, with more than 2 million Canadians applying for employment insurance in the second half of March.Statistics Canada conducted its labor force survey between March 15 and March 21, meaning the results should capture the early days of the disruption.The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey of 19 economists is for a drop of 500,000 jobs.

Oil rallied on expected output curbs.The S&P 500 fell for the third time in four days as investors digested the abysmal jobs report that captured data in the period largely before government-mandated shutdowns went into widespread effect. As with record claims for unemployment, the latest numbers bear little information on the current state of the economy, making it difficult for investors to value financial assets.\u201cNo one has ever experienced anything like this,\u201d Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the shock numbers out and the markets tend to front-run bad news. In other words, a lot of the bad news is already built into the market.\u201dThe S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent for the week, largely holding a rally that propelled it 18 per cent higher in three days last week. That came after the fastest 30 per cent plunge on record as the pandemic forced the economy into a virtual standstill. While volatility has eased somewhat, stocks are still regularly notching daily moves that until recently would have been considered huge.Oil surged following reports large producers are ready to cut output. Crude jumped another 13 per cent Friday after a record jump on news the OPEC+ coalition will hold a virtual meeting on Monday and that Russia is ready to cut production. Trump held a meeting with U.S. energy company executives Friday.In Europe, data showing an unprecedented slump in the region\u2019s economy last month pushed the Stoxx 600 Index lower, though it also trimmed its retreat. Asian equities saw modest losses in most markets to cap a third weekly decline in four. The yen weakened alongside the euro, pound and Swiss franc. Treasuries drifted.With lockdowns for many economies around the world expected to go on for longer, data are showing the severity of the impact. Nearly 10 million people in the U.S. have lost their jobs in the past two weeks, while the virus continues to pressure corporate balance sheets. American Airlines Group Inc. will slash international flying as far out as the end of August as the pandemic batters travel demand through the normally busy summer season.\u201cWe are not going to have the real recovery in the market until what we think is the peak in the amount of infections and deaths,\u201d Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cWe are going to continue to have very wide volatility until we can get over this uncertainty.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'This is freezing the market': Once roaring, Canadian home sales brace for 30% drop from coronavirus", "description": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-home-sales-30-percent-drop-coronavirus?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 2, 2020 12:23 PM EDT", "content": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home. One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201dReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dStill, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from coronavirus, job posting data suggests", "description": "Postings in Canada down 24%, while only 15% in U.S.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hiring-in-canada-drops-more-than-u-s-job-postings-data-show?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/montreal.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 1, 2020 8:20 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from the pandemic, according to a report by Indeed.com.Postings in Canada for the week ended March 27 were down 24 per cent from the same time last year, the job board website said in a report on Tuesday.

Now he has laid off all but 20 of his 138 staff to keep the 200-room hotel afloat.About $1-million worth of bookings evaporated in a few days as virus restrictions began, including from three brides in \u201cabsolute tears,\u201d said Urzada, 46, who took over the hotel from the Travelodge chain.His biggest priority is helping his employees negotiate an employment insurance system that\u2019s completely overloaded. With bill deferments, he figures he\u2019ll be able to hang on for two or three months. But he worries longer term.\u201cThe cash flow requirement this fall when all these bills come due for the whole economy is going to be overwhelming,\u201d he said, suggesting that deferrals are going to have be turned into forgiveness. \u201cYou can defer all you want but everyone\u2019s going to have their hands out in September.\u201dMandatory closures hit restaurants in Montreal, Quebec, a city known for its bustling food scene. A day after setting up a relief fund to help industry workers meet their most pressing needs, organizers had to close applications because there were too many to process. The group drew a line at 349 people and raised $41,500 on its GoFundMe page over a few days, but emails keep coming in.\u201cWe have some really heartbreaking pleas for help,\u201d said Jessica Cytryn, one of the organizers. \u201cOne of our members word-searched our emails to find people who said that they hadn\u2019t eaten in a few days and went out and bought food, and brought it to their homes.\u201dApplicants to the fund include Robin Wattie, a 36-year-old musician who saw her European tour canceled and lost her bar tending and waitressing jobs. She\u2019s awaiting a response to her application for unemployment benefits but worries she should have filed for provincial assistance instead.For now she makes do with a tiny cash stash and her credit card, and plans to ask for a new income replacement announced last week by Trudeau that gives $2,000 a month.\u201cIt\u2019s like this big stressful puzzle,\u201d she said.Paul Poscente has been getting calls every hour from his oil and gas clients, cancelling projects.His company, Backwoods Energy Services, provides a variety of services, including clearing timber and brush from work sites and building access roads and bridges. He\u2019s now expecting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent decline in business as Alberta takes the hit from the Russian-Saudi oil price war. Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta. It employs about 300 workers from the community, and its $140 million in annual revenue provides its largest independent source of funds.\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m doing a disservice to my family,\u201d Poscente said. \u201cIt\u2019s materially devastating to the community, and it feels personal.\u201dStill, Poscente, 57, said the company has grown with an \u201cultra-conservative\u201d balance sheet since he took over as CEO in 2015 and expects it to withstand the economic troubles better than most competitors.Flight attendant Max Audet got notice a week ago he\u2019d be laid off from Air Canada Rouge on April 3.\u201cThe main thing on my mind is that I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to be for,\u201d said Audet, 28, who is also a rep for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents flight attendants. \u201cIt really adds to the stress.\u201dAudet has immediately cut back. He\u2019s reduced automatic savings to his retirement account for his final paycheques and is being careful what he buys at the grocery store. He takes comfort from the fact that with five years under his belt, he\u2019s still senior to 62 per cent of Air Canada staff, thanks to a big hiring spree at the airline in recent years.\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about the lasting impact it will have on airlines,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we see people doing less travel, which could definitely affect staffing levels over time?\u201dOutside the Church of the Redeemer on Toronto\u2019s Mink Mile, one of Canada\u2019s ritziest shopping districts, the drop-in lunch program had plenty of customers.On a normal day, The Common Table provides about 80 lunches to the city\u2019s must vulnerable residents, but with similar programs closing, the number has spiked.\u201cThere\u2019s a good 20 per cent increase in the last few days,\u201d Justin Laflemme, a church custodian who helps out at the program, said. \u201cI spent a couple of years on the street as well so I recognize the faces and they\u2019re not regulars of our program.\u201dAs the virus spreads, he expects things to get worse.\u201cIt can happen overnight for some people,\u201d Laflemme said of the slide into homelessness. \u201cIt depends on their circumstances, what level of nest egg they have and what their income is.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.For individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn\u2019t require members to travel to Washington \u2014 as long as the bill does not have any \u201cpoison pills\u201d Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the \u201cthe president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation\u2019s economy as we work through this crisis.\u201dThe size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation\u2019s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third \u2014 and biggest \u2014 plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing.

It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed\u2019s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.\u201cWow, just wow,\u201d George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you\u2019ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.\u201dIn a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed\u2019s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.Monday\u2019s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.\u201cThis is not a slush-fund,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That\u2019s on top of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.\u201dBeyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed\u2019s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.\u201cThis is a great step forward,\u201d said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cGetting to the corporate bond market was critical.

That campaign would end about March 31.The discussions centred on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who\u2019s sick so healthy people can return to work.

This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government\u2019s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House\u2019s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump\u2019s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used.

Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move \u2014 alone \u2014 failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they\u2019re really inventing new stuff,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.\u201cThis is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201dPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.The Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.As recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Virus-driven interest rate cut could add kerosene to Canada's already hot housing market", "description": "Market poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/virus-driven-rate-cut-could-add-kerosene-to-canadas-housing-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 10:30 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s housing market is poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus.While a reduced travel from China may crimp sales in Vancouver, and the potential for a recession could set the market back, the possibility of interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada is likely to fuel further declines in mortgage rates and draw buyers into the market.\u201cPeople are not concerned about coronavirus, people are not concerned about recession,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said Monday by phone. \u201cThe only things they\u2019re worried about is buying a home \u2014 and if they don\u2019t buy now they might spend more in the future.\u201dA confluence of factors is priming the pump for a brisk buying season.

The figures mark a divergence from the U.S., where women eclipsed men as the majority of jobholders.The fastest pace of immigration in the Group of Seven is a big factor behind the trend in Canada, spurring a housing boom that\u2019s pushing up demand for everything from plumbers to electricians. A fast-track visa process is also pulling in workers to the male-dominated field of technology, while male immigrants are more likely than women to work outside the home.Canada notched another solid year of job gains in 2019, with the unemployment rate hovering near a four-decade low of 5.6 per cent. The female unemployment rate dipped even lower than men, reaching a record 4.9 per cent in May but the big job gains have skewed male.Jared Menkes, executive vice president at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd., said finding enough labour is a constant source of angst.

Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau\u2019s Liberals push to reduce Canada\u2019s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 \u2014 sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O\u2019Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario\u2019s resurgence.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in life,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto\u2019s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think since this job started I\u2019ve worked less than a 60-hour week.\u201dJust under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis.

Howe Institute in Toronto.\u201cGenerally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cHowever, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.\u201dThe broad-ranging category of \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical services,\u201d which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn\u2019t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that\u2019s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can\u2019t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.\u201cAlmost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hardest time if you\u2019re an employer, but if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.\u201dRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.\u201cA growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can\u2019t find work,\u201d Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O\u2019Neill, the crane operator, doesn\u2019t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.\u201cShe\u2019s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, too.

Fear and doubt is not a good thought process, because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.\u201dThe World Economic Forum audience included 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who brought a stark message to the business elite gathering in Davos: Everybody is talking about climate change, but nobody is doing anything. Trump has mocked Thunberg on Twitter.The forum is sounding alarm bells on climate change. This year and for the first time on record, environmental risks occupy the group\u2019s top five long-term concerns, while corporate executives say they\u2019re increasingly concerned about environmental issues.Trump\u2019s remarks were largely focused on America\u2019s economy as an example to other nations, which he urged to cut regulations and taxes. Trump sought to take credit for a booming economy, repeating his re-election arguments just hours before the U.S. Senate was set to formally start his impeachment trial.\u201cI\u2019m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve regained our stride, rediscovered our spirit.\u201dTrump recounted how his administration presided over cuts in regulations and taxes, and described low unemployment rates for African Americans and women.Trump claims credit for overseeing an economy enjoying its longest-ever expansion, with an unemployment rate that fell to a five-decade low after tax cuts and spending increases. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which Trump regularly cites as a marker of success, is up about 25 per cent from a year ago.But his fight with China over trade and other protectionist policies have created uncertainty among businesses, especially manufacturers. Despite last week\u2019s interim trade deal with Beijing, the International Monetary Fund on Monday predicted economic growth will moderate to 2 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 2021 from 2.3 per cent in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes.America\u2019s thriving, America is flourishing and, yes, America is winning again like never beforeIn his speech at the Swiss resort, Trump said: \u201cThe American dream is back, bigger better and stronger than ever before.\u201dThe president repeated his grievances with the Fed, saying it raised rates too quickly and lowered them too slowly.Trump said in his speech that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201clove each other\u201d even after their fight over trade.\u201cHe\u2019s for China and I\u2019m for the U.S., but other than that, we love each other,\u201d Trump said.Trump is due to hold bilateral meetings with Iraqi President Barham Salih, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga and Nechirvan Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, according to the White House. Trump will also meet with the forum\u2019s executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, and has said he\u2019ll meet with business leaders, too. He leaves Davos on Wednesday.This is Trump\u2019s second visit as president to the annual gathering of business chiefs, central bankers and foreign leaders. Hanging over the trip this time, however, is his impeachment trial set to formally begin in the Senate. Trump will almost certainly be acquitted by the Republican majority in the Senate, but the trial may produce surprises.Trump has sought to highlight his trade and economic victories to contrast the impeachment proceedings. He skipped Davos in 2017 out of concern that the well-heeled Davos crowd was the wrong fit for a man elected on a nationalist, anti-elites message. He attended in 2018, then skipped last year amid a government shutdown.Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the biggest-name political leaders in attendance; Trump has regularly complained that Merkel spends too little on defence, doesn\u2019t do enough in Ukraine and is too soft on Iran\u2019s regime, but won\u2019t meet with her in Davos.Other speakers include teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Trump has insulted on Twitter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose phone call with Trump triggered the impeachment process, is also due to attend briefly but not to meet with the U.S. president.Once Trump leaves on Wednesday, the U.S. delegation will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Trump\u2019s first Davos appearance in 2018 oscillated between a vintage, raucous version of Trump in meetings with national leaders and business executives and more subdued remarks in his formal speech. He touted his agenda but added: \u201cAmerica First does not mean America alone.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Stock bulls keep calm in Canada, look past flare-up in Iran tensions", "description": "Canada's stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November last week, after reaching a fresh record Thursday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-bulls-keep-calm-in-canada-shaking-off-iranian-tensions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 8:56 PM EST", "content": "If you\u2019ve only just come back from your holiday break and looked at equity markets, you\u2019d think nothing bad happened last week.Canada\u2019s stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November after reaching a fresh record Thursday, while the S&P 500 rose almost 1 per cent.

The Iranian government admitted Saturday it had mistakenly downed the jet, spreading anger across the globe.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201dThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.On trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Leslie Patton", "title": "Taco Bell is so desperate for workers it's offering $100,000 salaries", "description": "Amid an increasingly tough U.S. labour market, the company is betting a higher salary will help it attract workers and keep them on the team", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/taco-bell-is-so-desperate-for-workers-its-offering-100000-salaries", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/taco-bell.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2020 1:55 PM EST", "content": "Wanted: Restaurant manager.

During his long odyssey through the Japanese legal system \u2014 several arrests, more than 100 days in solitary confinement, seemingly endless interrogations, and, after his release on bail, intrusive 24-hour surveillance \u2014 Ghosn had been forced to accept many humiliations. But few demoralized the ousted leader of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA as much as having to seek court permission even to call his spouse, who prosecutors viewed as a potential co-conspirator in some of the wide range of financial crimes with which he\u2019s been charged.Carole, who\u2019d departed Japan in a hurry after her husband was taken into custody on a fourth charge in early April, has spent much of the last year lobbying tirelessly on his behalf \u2014 a campaign that was taking an obvious toll. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed our lives, we are scarred forever,\u201d she said of Ghosn\u2019s accusers in a November interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cIt\u2019s been the hardest year of my life.\u201d They were allowed to speak for one hour, but it wasn\u2019t enough; they still had much more to say to each other. As time ran out, according to one of Ghosn\u2019s lawyers, who described the call on his blog, the fallen executive signed off with a simple \u201cI love you, habibi,\u201d an Arabic term of affection.They've destroyed our lives, we are scarred foreverIt seemed impossible to know when the couple would next have a chance to speak, let alone embrace. The following day, the 65-year-old Ghosn learned that the second of his two trials might begin only in 2021, raising the prospect of another year or more in court-imposed isolation. Even his children were being targeted by investigators. Japanese prosecutors had questioned Ghosn\u2019s son Anthony, who was involved in some of the transactions they were targeting, as well as one of his daughters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fearing arrest, Anthony had been unable to visit his father.Ghosn\u2019s prospects of proving his innocence in Japan were dismal. Prosecutors there win more than 99 per cent of the cases they try and enjoy a wide range of procedural advantages. Against Ghosn, who was facing potential sentences of more than a decade in prison, they had an even greater-than-usual asset: the full co-operation of Nissan, which had repeatedly made clear its determination to see him convicted and had provided a huge trove of documents as well as hands-on investigative assistance. Ghosn, a citizen of Brazil, France, and Lebanon, had sought diplomatic help from all three countries. Only the last had acted with evident enthusiasm, but its efforts weren\u2019t getting anywhere.Ghosn, however, had another option \u2014 a desperate play, months in the planning, that might restore some portion of his freedom if everything went right, or send him straight back to a 7-square-meter (75-square-foot) cell in Tokyo\u2019s central jail if any aspect went awry. In the Middle East, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and a veteran of the 2003 invasion of Iraq were preparing a daring plan to spirit Ghosn out of Tokyo, under the noses of Japanese police. They aimed to bring him back to Beirut \u2014 the city where he had spent most of his childhood, and the capital of a country where, thanks to his business success, Ghosn is considered something of a national hero.On its face, it must have seemed like a ridiculous idea. While the terms of Ghosn\u2019s bail did not include a requirement to wear an ankle bracelet or other electronic tracker, his movements were closely monitored. Prosecutors had trained a camera on the door of his rented house, in Tokyo\u2019s busy Roppongi neighbourhood, and as he moved through the Japanese capital he was shadowed by teams of plainclothes agents. Ghosn, who has bushy eyebrows, elongated ears and prominent sideburns, would have a memorable face even as a regular citizen, but two decades of corporate celebrity meant that he was perhaps the most recognizable foreigner in Japan. His chances of slipping undetected through Tokyo and onto an airplane would have seemed slim, to put it mildly.Yet there was a clear window of opportunity. New Year\u2019s is typically the longest holiday of the year in Japan, a time when government offices can close for more than a week and even the most hard-boiled prosecutors and police detectives take time off to be with their families. Moreover, Ghosn had good reason to believe he could evade at least some of the men monitoring his movements: his lawyers had recently threatened to file a complaint against a private security company hired by Nissan to follow him, claiming it was infringing illegally on his rights. According to a person familiar with the situation, the company\u2019s agents had backed off as a result \u2014 at least temporarily. (Nissan declined to comment.) If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help.In the shadowy world of private-security contractors, Michael Taylor was a swashbuckler who stood out. He protected powerful people and companies, secretly helped the U.S. government investigate crimes, and admitted breaking the law himself. A veteran of the U.S. Army\u2019s elite Special Forces \u2014 the famed Green Berets \u2014 Taylor in 1994 founded American International Security Corp., a Boston-area contractor that provided security for oil drilling operations and corporate executives, and rescued abducted children among other assignments. He was hired by The New York Times to mount a rescue of David Rohde, a correspondent who\u2019d been kidnapped in 2008 in Afghanistan. (Rohde ultimately escaped on his own). He also worked as an undercover asset for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal bodies.Taylor\u2019s career seemed to be prospering in 2007 when his firm secured a Pentagon contract, which eventually paid out US$54 million, to train Afghan special-forces troops. But in 2012, his fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. He was charged in Utah with an FBI agent over a plot to obstruct a fraud investigation of whether the Afghan contract was awarded improperly. Taylor ultimately pleaded guilty to two fraud charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. It wasn\u2019t his first guilty plea. In 1997, he admitted two misdemeanour charges in Massachusetts related to a police report filed in a domestic case in which he\u2019d been hired, his lawyers said.If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right helpMuch of Taylor\u2019s work over the years had, improbably enough, involved Lebanon. Taylor was born on Staten Island and graduated high school in Massachusetts, but over the years he developed deep ties to Ghosn\u2019s home country. He was deployed to Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, beginning what his lawyers said was \u201ca lifelong relationship with the Christian community in Lebanon\u201d \u2014 the same community of which Ghosn is a prominent member. Fit, square-jawed and with silver hair, Taylor speaks Arabic, his wife Lamia is Lebanese, and two of their three sons attended college in Lebanon.For the Ghosn operation, Taylor had a partner, a Lebanese-born man named George-Antoine Zayek. Originally trained as a gemologist, his brother said by telephone, Zayek was also a member of a Christian militia when he met Taylor in the early 1980s, according to a person familiar with the matter, a time when Lebanon had fractured violently along sectarian lines. Zayek appears to have been associated with Taylor and his companies since the 1990s, based on public records in the U.S. According to his brother, however, Zayek left Lebanon at the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he began working for a private security company there. Taylor couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and Zayek didn\u2019t respond to multiple voicemail messages seeking comment.On the morning of Sunday, Dec. 29, Taylor and Zayek arrived in a Bombardier Global Express Jet \u2014 a plane with a range of more than 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) \u2014 at the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport, a busy hub built on an artificial island near Osaka. There were also two large black cases on board, according to people familiar with the flight who asked not to be identified.Later the same day, according to security-camera footage reported on by Japanese media, Ghosn walked out the front door of his house, wearing a hat and a surgical-style face mask commonly used in Japan to protect against germs. He then took a bullet train from Tokyo\u2019s Shinagawa station to Osaka at about 4:30 p.m. local time and, after the journey, took a cab to a hotel near the airport, the network NTV reported. That evening the same\u00a0Bombardier\u00a0jet took off from Kansai bound for Istanbul. According to a person familiar with the investigation of the flight, the team believed that flying straight to Beirut, a city that receives few if any arrivals from Osaka, would raise too many suspicions.Outbound passengers at the private terminal aren\u2019t exempt from passport control, and according to people familiar with airport operations, there were customs and immigration officials present before the Bombardier\u2019s departure. But Ghosn wasn\u2019t boarding as an official passenger. He was, apparently, cargo, concealed in a large black case that, according to the people, was too big to fit into the airport\u2019s\u00a0X-ray machines. With nothing obviously amiss, by 11:10 p.m., the jet was in the air.Reaching Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport would take just over 12 hours. The team ferrying Ghosn appeared to have chosen its route carefully. From Osaka the plane headed north-northwest, avoiding South Korea \u2014 which has an extradition treaty with Japan \u2014 and then crossing into Russian airspace, where it remained for almost its entire journey. That wasn\u2019t the most direct route, which would have taken the jet over China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. But it did keep Ghosn over a country where he has considerable connections, thanks to his work rescuing AvtoVAZ, a troubled Soviet-era automaker that\u2019s now part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. If the Japanese government demanded his plane be stopped, he might have hoped for sympathy, or at least stalling, from Moscow.In fact, the Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country, and the Bombardier landed in Istanbul at around 5:30 a.m. local time on Dec. 30. Changing planes at Ataturk could expose Ghosn once again to detection. Just as at Kansai, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified discussing the details of the government\u2019s subsequent investigation, Ghosn made the short trip inside a box. The second jet, a shorter-range Bombardier, took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the countrySafely on the ground in the country of his youth, Ghosn didn\u2019t have to hide his identity. Although his lawyers had taken his travel documents as a condition of his bail, Ghosn had two French passports \u2014 a rare privilege, granted to citizens whose employment might require them to travel while also handing over a passport for visa applications. Ghosn had been able to keep the second one, under the condition that it remain in a plastic case secured by a combination lock for which only his lawyers had the code. According to a person familiar with it, the case wasn\u2019t particularly sturdy, and with a hammer or drill and a bit of time it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to crack open. His French passport in hand, Ghosn crossed into Lebanon legally.Carole, who had been counting the days since the couple had last been together (just short of nine months) was in Beirut to see her family for Christmas when Ghosn landed. She rushed to meet him and kept him largely to herself until the couple met up with a few friends for a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. A photo showed them at a table sharing wine and Champagne. They looked, if only for a moment, like a normal couple with normal concerns.Even Ghosn\u2019s closest advisers were blindsided when news of his escape began to break on Dec. 31. His Japanese lawyers said they had no idea what he had planned; in an impromptu press conference outside his office, lead counsel Junichiro Hironaka seemed genuinely bewildered by what had just occurred, describing himself as \u201cdumbfounded.\u201d Ghosn\u2019s U.S. representatives at Paul Weiss, the white-shoe New York law firm, had been kept similarly in the dark. So was Greg Kelly, the former Nissan executive who\u2019d been taken into custody at the same time and remains in Tokyo, forbidden to leave the country before trial. (He denies wrongdoing). With no details forthcoming on how Ghosn managed to sneak out of Japan, media outlets around the world began speculating on a range of outlandish theories \u2014 the most widely circulated that he had left his house disguised as a very large musical instrument after hosting a troupe of Lebanese musicians for a holiday concert.Ghosn\u2019s public-relations apparatus, which includes top-drawer firms in New York and Paris, let most of the speculation go uncommented upon. That changed dramatically as reports began to appear suggesting that Carole Ghosn or other members of his family had helped plan his escape \u2014 which, if accurate, might expose them to criminal charges in Japan or elsewhere. On Jan. 2, Ghosn said in a statement that, somewhat improbably given the constant surveillance of his communications, \u201cI alone arranged for my departure.\u201d His family, he said, \u201chad no role whatsoever.\u201dEven if that\u2019s true, Ghosn had plenty of help from individuals who may now be at risk of serious legal repercussions. In Turkey, the authorities quickly detained seven people connected with the flights, including four pilots, and remanded most of them into custody.\u00a0MNG Jet Havacilik\u00a0AS, the company from which the aircraft were leased, also filed a criminal complaint and said an employee falsified records in order to hide the fact that they were ferrying a fugitive. Japan\u2019s justice minister, meanwhile, announced the opening of an investigation into Ghosn\u2019s escape, raising the prospect of charges for anyone who aided him. Nor is Ghosn entirely in the clear. While Lebanon is a nation that refuses, as a matter of policy, to extradite its citizens for trial abroad, he\u2019s probably stuck there indefinitely. Japan has requested that Interpol issue a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn\u2019s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive. His life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over.(Ghosn's) life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, overA long-term life on the run isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s not impossible. Roman Polanski, the Rosemary\u2019s Baby director who fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid being imprisoned in an underage sex case, has lived openly in Europe ever since \u2014 protected by France\u2019s similar policy against extraditing \u2014 and he remains a celebrated if controversial filmmaker. But such an existence wouldn\u2019t deliver what Ghosn seems to crave most: legal vindication. His lawyers intend to propose that he be tried on the Japanese allegations in Lebanon, with Tokyo prosecutors providing investigative files to allow their Beirut counterparts to bring the case, according to Ghosn\u2019s Beirut attorney, Carlos Abou Jaoude. Such an arrangement would be all but unprecedented, and, for the Japanese government, deeply embarrassing: agreeing to it would amount to an admission that it won\u2019t be able to get him back. Japanese prosecutors, meanwhile, would be certain to view a Lebanese trial as biased in favour of the defendant. Ghosn is one of Lebanon\u2019s most celebrated citizens \u2014 his face is even on a postage stamp \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine a friendlier locale for a hearing.Ghosn was awaiting trial in Japan on four charges \u2014 two for allegedly understating his compensation in regulatory filings, and two more \u201cbreach of trust\u201d allegations, in which prosecutors claim he used Nissan\u2019s resources for his own gain. From the beginning of his legal drama he\u2019s denied wrongdoing and claimed that the allegations against him are the result of a political vendetta \u2014 an illegitimate attempt to settle scores and stop him from integrating Nissan more closely with Renault \u2014 that should never have put him in a courtroom, let alone a jail cell. According to people familiar with his intentions, he plans to use his freedom to assail the Japanese legal system and to do everything he can to publicly discredit the charges. His first salvo will come at a press conference he plans to hold in Beirut on Wednesday.Throughout his career, Ghosn portrayed himself as a singular figure, the driving force behind the creation of one of the world\u2019s largest automotive groups and the only person capable of keeping it together. In recent years he was clearly in legacy mode, preparing the groundwork for a deal that would finally bring Nissan and Renault together under a single corporate umbrella. Had his plans to incorporate rival Fiat-Chrysler into the alliance come to fruition, he might have created the world\u2019s largest carmaker and reasonably expected to be remembered as a business visionary, one of the few individuals \u2014 like Lee Iacocca, Jack Welch or Gordon Moore \u2014 whose careers helped reshape their industries. For the foreseeable future, however, he will be known above all as something very different: a fugitive.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Anooja Debnath", "title": "Euro Forecasters See a World-Beating\u00a0Run in 2020", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 After two years of setbacks, the euro is enjoying a wave of much-needed investor optimism as 2019 draws to a close.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/euro-forecasters-see-a-world-beating-run-in-2020", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "December 27, 2019 2:42 PM EST", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 After two years of setbacks, the euro is enjoying a wave of much-needed investor optimism as 2019 draws to a close.The shared currency will rally more than 4% against the dollar in 2020 in the world\u2019s best foreign-exchange performance, according to the median estimates of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Forecasters see it benefiting from an improving global economic outlook and fading political tensions.Betting on euro gains is among Morgan Stanley\u2019s top trades for the new year, a view shared by analysts at UBS Wealth Management and Credit Agricole, among others.

The one-month measure, which covers the next European Central Bank decision on Jan. 23, was at 20 basis points.The euro wrong-footed markets this year by falling against a surprisingly resilient dollar, when it was forecast to rally around 5%. Fears that the U.S.-led tariff war with China could spread to Europe, concerns around Brexit and an overall subdued outlook for the global economy weighed on the shared currency.

GM has been producing vehicles at the plant since 1918, making it the company\u2019s oldest existing assembly plant.The business survived two world wars and the Depression, and grew into one of the world\u2019s largest auto-manufacturing facilities with tens of thousands of employees. It even survived GM\u2019s bankruptcy. But the Oshawa assembly plant could not weather two other inexorable forces: the emergence of low-wage Mexico as an auto-making powerhouse and GM\u2019s bet on electric vehicles.The shutdown of Oshawa assembly is part of a reorganization that trims excess production as auto sales soften and GM shifts resources to focus on electric and autonomous vehicles. The overhaul cut a net 11,000 workers across the company. The Oshawa plant had been making Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.Starting next year, the site will be used for parts manufacturing and a test track for advanced technology vehicles. Of the roughly 2,200 employees GM says are affected, 1,600 are taking buyout packages, including 1,200 who will retire on defined benefit pensions, giving them a guaranteed income for life.About 300 employees will be able to work at the new operations and about 100 have transferred to GM facilities elsewhere in Ontario. Two hundred are hoping to be recalled, either in Oshawa or elsewhere in Ontario, and will receive layoff benefits in the meantime, according to Jennifer Wright, a spokeswoman with GM Canada.A group of workers is lobbying the government to take over the plant and convert it to electric-vehicle production. The employment losses rise to about 5,000 when hundreds of temporary part-time workers are taken into account, along with over 1,000 outsourced GM jobs, and more than 1,000 supplier jobs, according to Tony Leah, a spokesman for Green Jobs Oshawa and chairman of the political action committee for Unifor Local 222.For its part, GM says the creation of an autonomous testing track \u2014 named after Colonel Sam McLaughlin \u2014 will continue the company\u2019s legacy in Oshawa. The automaker is also boosting its headcount of software engineers in Markham, Ontario, about 50 kilometres to the west of Oshawa.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shawn Donnan, Miao Han and Jenny Leonard", "title": "China, U.S. agree to phase one trade deal that reduces tariffs and eases tensions", "description": "China will increase imports from the U.S. as part of the agreement", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/china-says-deal-agreed-u-s-to-roll-back-tariffs-in-stages?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/china.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 13, 2019 1:09 PM EST", "content": "The U.S. and China said they agreed to the details of the first phase of a broader trade agreement in a move that will see the U.S. reduce tariffs and at least temporarily calm fears of an escalating trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.The deal announced hinges on China increasing purchases of American farm goods such as soybeans and pork, and making new commitments on intellectual property and currency. Speaking to reporters in Washington, President Donald Trump said he expects China\u2019s agriculture buying to hit US$50 billion annually \u201cpretty soon,\u201d without specifying a timetable.In return, Trump agreed to reduce some existing U.S. tariffs, halving 15 per cent duties on US$120 billion of imports but maintaining a 25 per cent levy on some US$250 billion of Chinese goods. He said he would also delay new import taxes set to take effect on Sunday on US$160 billion of products such as smartphones and toys.\u201cThis is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets that came as Chinese officials announced the deal at a late-night press conference in Beijing.\u2026..The Penalty Tariffs set for December 15th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal. We will begin negotiations on the Phase Two Deal immediately, rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election. This is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!The S&P 500 Index swung between gains and losses, while the dollar fluctuated with Treasuries as neither side delivered enough details to calm investors who sent stocks to records Thursday on reports fresh tariffs due Sunday have been averted. Washington and Beijing have been in trade war for almost two years with involving nearly US$500 billion in products shipped between the two nations hit by tit-for-tat tariffs.That mixed market reaction reflected the fact that details of the deal remained murky.The text agreed by the two sides comprises nine chapters, includes sections on intellectual property, forced technology transfer, food and agricultural products, finance, currency and transparency, boosting trade, bilateral assessment and dispute resolution, Chinese officials said in Beijing. While it had been agreed, Chinese officials said, the text still needed to undergo a review by lawyers on both sides, a normal step for trade agreements. U.S. tariffs would be rolled back in stages, they said.Ning Jizhe, the vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, stressed that increased agricultural purchases must comply with World Trade Organization rules. \u201cExpanding China-U.S. trade will not affect interests of other trading partners,\u201d he said.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement the agreement also included an enforcement mechanism, though it wasn\u2019t detailed.The interim deal with China, which was announced as impeachment proceeding against Trump progressed in Congress on Friday, offers a short-term political victory for the president and will allow him to claim that his tariffs have paid dividends. It was hailed by Trump supporters in Congress as well as some former U.S. officials who had tried their own hand at negotiating with China.\u201cThis is the first bilateral trade deal in 20 years \u2014 it was hard fought, hard won and long overdue,\u201d said Hank Paulson, the former U.S. Treasury secretary. \u201cWhile the issues between the U.S. and China extend far beyond trade, this is a first step toward completing a comprehensive trade agreement.\u201dDemocrats criticized the deal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying Trump \u201csold out for a temporary and unreliable promise\u201d from China to purchase soybeans.Business groups immediately called for more negotiations on future phases to get under way. \u201cThis is an encouraging first phase that puts a floor under further deterioration of the bilateral relationship,\u201d U.S.-China Business Council President Craig Allen said in a statement. \u201cBut this is just the beginning. The issues facing the U.S. and China are complex and multi-faceted. They are unlikely to all be resolved quickly.\u201dTrump said on Friday that negotiations on a second phase of the agreement would begin \u201cimmediately.\u201d\u201cChina would like to see the tariffs off and we\u2019re ok with that,\u201dhe told reporters. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be used as a negotiating table for the phase two deal, which they would like to start immediately and that\u2019s ok with me.\u201dBut many analysts remain skeptical that Trump will be able to conclude those talks on those more intractable issues before the November 2020 election. Chinese officials have privately expressed skepticism that progress can be made past phase one, as have some U.S. business leaders. That has raised questions about the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s strategy and the tariffs that he has rolled out in a way not seen since the 1930s despite the deal announced on Friday.Some analysts did suggest that the limited scale of the deal may help Trump weather criticism of it from China hawks and others and therefore contribute to the fragile peace holding.\u201cThe reason the president insisted phase 2 will start immediately is phase 1 is very small,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the Trump administration. \u201cThe positive side is that a small deal implemented slowly is much more likely to hold through the election, versus a seemingly big deal falling apart.\u201dBoth Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have been under domestic political pressure to get at least a partial deal as a result of the impact of the trade war on both both the U.S. and Chinese economies this year. Many economists have pinned forecasts for a global economic rebound next year on a cease-fire.China\u2019s gross domestic product rose 6 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the early 1990. The U.S. is showing signs of downshifting, too, with a record-long expansion weakening to a crawl this quarter as tariffs spread uncertainty across manufacturers and others whose supply lines run through China.That damage has put particular pressure on Trump, who is pinning hopes for re-election next year on a solid economy that boasts the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s.

Economic growth was seen at 2 per cent in 2020 and 1.9 per cent in 2021, both unchanged from the last estimates. Inflation is seen hitting 2 per cent in 2021, unchanged from the prior projection.Powell will mark his second anniversary as Fed chairman in February. He has endured a barrage of attacks from President Donald Trump, who picked him for the job but has labeled Fed policies \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cpathetic\u201d and called for steeper rate cuts.Now, after decisively loosening monetary policy following rate hikes in 2018, Powell has a shot at pulling off a soft landing.While factory gauges suggest that segment of the economy is in a slump, Fed officials say they are counting on consumer spending to keep the expansion going. Wages are rising faster than inflation, and employers continue to add jobs with nonfarm payrolls rising 266,000 in November. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect growth to cool next year but remain near to the long-run trend.The Fed\u2019s rate cuts have also eased borrowing costs and pushed stock prices to record highs, which may support greater spending by boosting wealth and lifting confidence.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Justin Villamil, Lorena Rios and Erik Wasson", "title": "\u2018We are ready to rock and roll\u2019: Mexico says all three countries will sign new NAFTA deal today", "description": "Deal must then be ratified by each of their respective legislatures", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/mexico-says-all-three-countries-will-sign-usmca-today", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/nancy-pelosi.png", "publishedAt": "December 10, 2019 10:16 AM EST", "content": "Mexico, Canada and the U.S. have all agreed to sign the USMCA regional trade accord on Tuesday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in his daily press conference.The deal will be signed by representative from each country Tuesday and must then be ratified by each one of their respective legislature.

So far in 2019, there have been 102,023 consumer insolvencies, the second-most for the first nine months of a year in records dating back to 1987.While the increases are coming from low levels, the trend is a worrying development that suggests cracks are starting to appear in Canada\u2019s household debt landscape, at least for the most extended individuals. That would be all the more concerning, since it could foreshadow pressure on the country\u2019s financial system. And it\u2019s a bit of a puzzle, given the economic backdrop has been positive, including an unemployment rate that\u2019s dropped to historically low levels.\u201cNormally there\u2019s a story you can tell, like there\u2019s some underlying weakness that shows up with a bit of a lag in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies,\u201d said Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to see that now. It\u2019s perplexing.\u201dInsolvencies are accelerating at a pace that\u2019s been associated with periods of distress: the start of the 2008-09 financial crisis, immediately before the 1990-92 recession, and during the period of pronounced economic weakness in 1995-96 that was tied to the Mexican peso crisis.The significance of the latest data is open to debate. For one thing, the insolvency numbers are at odds with other indicators that show a more benign environment for household debt. For instance, mortgage arrears were 0.23 per cent nationally at the end of July, close to the lowest they\u2019ve ever been, and delinquency rates on non-mortgage debt remain subdued.It's perplexingIn addition, a strong labour market, rising wages, interest rates that are lower than they were at the start of the year and a recovery in home prices all suggest borrowers should have more breathing room, not less.It\u2019s \u201chard to square\u201d the jump in insolvencies with that backdrop, according to David Tulk, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t a trend that would represent the average borrower, but is instead catching the fringe that have over-extended themselves,\u201d he said in an email.That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s downplaying the insolvency numbers, but rather they confirm his prior concerns about Canadian households. \u201cWhat I worry about more is that households use the retrenchment in rates to add even more leverage, and then we get an employment shock,\u201d he said.Brett House is more sanguine. While the latest surge in filings is \u201ca bit concerning\u201d given low unemployment and low interest rates, the deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto said \u201cthere are a number of important factors that temper the implications of the September print.\u201dFor one thing, the share of insolvencies to the total amount of household debt is falling. There were 5.3 filings for every $1 billion ($760 million) in total household debt as of September, versus 17.8 in 1997.Adjusting for population growth, the numbers also looks less dramatic. For instance, some 0.06 per cent of the Canadian workforce filed for insolvency, based on September numbers, versus 0.09 per cent a decade ago \u2014 though the rate has moved higher over the past 20 years.Tulk said he won\u2019t read too much into one month\u2019s worth of insolvency data. But if next month\u2019s print shows a further increase and if things look shaky elsewhere, \u201cI will be sufficiently nervy,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Keith Naughton", "title": "Ford\u2019s new Mustang Mach-E is an electric SUV \u2014 and you can reserve one Sunday", "description": "Market still waiting for true competitive threat to Tesla Model 3, analyst says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/ford-affixes-iconic-mustang-name-to-first-electric-crossover", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/ford-mustang-mach-e.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 14, 2019 2:07 PM EST", "content": "Ford Motor Co., which pioneered the racy pony-car body style 55 years ago, will use the Mustang name and insignia on an electric crossover utility vehicle coming next year.The automaker said it\u2019s expanding the Mustang stable for the first time with a model that will lead its charge in the electric-vehicle market dominated by Tesla Inc.

Premium brands have priced models including the Audi e-tron, Jaguar I-Pace and Mercedes-Benz EQC too high to snare many buyers, Credit Suisse\u2019s Levy said.

The next day, his Quebec counterpart Eric Girard will raise the province\u2019s economic growth forecasts and announce plans for a sixth straight year of balanced books.The country\u2019s two largest provincial economies are updating their budget outlooks one week after Alberta said it would cut spending and increase taxes in an effort to wrestle down a budget deficit ravaged by a slump in oil prices. Premier Jason Kenney has floated the idea of re-negotiating equalization payments that funnel tax revenue between the provinces via the federal government to help Alberta cope.\u201cIt plays in some way into the frustration\u201d in Alberta, said Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Credit Union Central Alberta in Calgary. \u201cThe current economic situation seems to be forgotten by the rest of the country.\u201dTax collections in the two provinces, which account for about 57 per cent of the country\u2019s economy, have been supported by booming job markets which have driven Ontario\u2019s unemployment rate down to 5.3 per cent and Quebec\u2019s to 4.8 per cent. In contrast, Alberta\u2019s jobless rate runs at 6.6 per cent and Kenney plans to cut the government\u2019s operating expenditures by 2.8 per cent and its public sector workforce by 7.7 per cent to reduce the budget deficit to $5.9 billion next fiscal year from $8.7 billion this year.Ontario\u2019s budget shortfall for the year ending March 31 will be smaller than the $10.3 billion projected, said Phillips in October. Quebec will boost its 1.8 per cent growth forecast for this year, Girard said at a Bloomberg conference in October. Economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank see growth of 2.5 per cent for Quebec.The current economic situation seems to be forgotten by the rest of the countryThe extra yield investors demand to hold Alberta\u2019s 10-year bonds instead of Ontario\u2019s widened to around 11 basis points on Tuesday compared with a recent low of 6 basis points on May 17, according to Bloomberg Valuation prices. Quebec yields are lower by around 2 basis points along the curve for any duration shorter than 15 years.Even as Quebec and Ontario have consistently outperformed Alberta\u2019s economy during the last four years, Alberta hasn\u2019t received anything under the equalization system, because its traditionally had higher income per capita. Quebec has received almost US$46 billion in the last four years, and Ontario received about US$4.7 billion, according to government data.The equalization boost is helping Quebec to balance its books and even set aside some cash under its so-called Generations Fund to help repay existing debt. It also helped Ontario \u2014 though to a lesser extent, to deal with its deficits.The situation is fuelling resentment in Alberta which has seen thousands of job losses, and an exit of foreign capital during the oil slump.\u201cEqualization payments are a big part of what keeps Quebec on balance,\u201d said Randall Malcolm, senior managing director of fixed income at Sun Life Investment Management. \u201cWhen you think about equalization payments coming over and Quebec running a generations fund, which part of it is essentially run as a hedge fund, it does seems a little strange.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Susanne Barton", "title": "How the election result could clip the wings of Canada\u2019s high-flying loonie", "description": "A trader\u2019s guide to Canada\u2019s tight election", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-minority-rule-a-traders-guide-to-canadas-tight-election?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 18, 2019 2:12 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s dollar is the best-performing major currency this year and the nation\u2019s stocks are going strong. But now isn\u2019t the time for investors to rest on their laurels. The upcoming federal election is the next big event to test the market\u2019s resilience.With less than a week left to the Oct. 21 vote, Liberal Party Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in a neck-and-neck race with Conservatives leader Andrew Scheer. While the most likely scenario is a government that doesn\u2019t command an absolute majority in its own right, some strategists say that a minority administration led by Scheer could be better for the loonie in the near term than one under Trudeau.\u201cBetween a Liberal-led minority and a Conservative-led minority, we expect the first one to be more CAD-negative,\u201d Francesco Pesole, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank, said in an Oct. 17 report. \u201cThe balance of risks for the loonie appears tilted to the downside.\u201dThe loonie has been in the No. 1 spot among Group-of-10 currencies this year, rising almost 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar amid a sound economy and a low unemployment rate. Canada\u2019s benchmark equity index has rallied 15 per cent in 2019, making it one of the top gainers among developed markets. It was little changed against the greenback Friday.A Conservative minority government would be better for market sentiment than a Liberal minority administration, according to Pesole. He said this is in part because it would likely exclude smaller parties that oppose more oil pipelines, a subject that has been a focus of political debate.A rebound in housing, solid economic growth and one of the strongest job markets in recent times has helped give Trudeau something positive to talk about during his campaign. While major central banks in other parts of the world have been cutting interest rates, the Bank of Canada has been reluctant to do so thus far \u2014 strengthening the Canadian dollar\u2019s position as one of the highest yielders among G-10 currencies.Michael Hsueh, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, says a Trudeau-led minority government could be negative for the Canadian dollar given the reduced capacity to pass legislation. It could also potentially hinder growth in oil, a key industry for Canada, one of the world\u2019s largest energy exporters.Stewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of the elections. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and has promised to remove regulations Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.The loonie, often seen as a petrocurrency, has benefited from the nation\u2019s massive oil exports. Still, bringing more oil reserves to market has divided Canadians \u2014 with two pipelines being scrapped on Trudeau\u2019s watch.Foreign-exchange strategists are concerned that a Trudeau-led government, propped up by other left-leaning parties, could be an obstacle in passing legislation favourable to business leaders and the country\u2019s energy sector.A Liberal minority government is \u201clikely to push for more regulation and rules on capital inflows into Canada,\u201d which could be negative for the Canadian dollar, Mark McCormick, global head of currency strategy at Toronto-based TD Securities, said in an email.While Canadian politics rarely play a significant role in the nation\u2019s equity market, a minority government could be positive for stocks, according to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\u201cAlthough on average the market has posted relatively strong performance post federal elections, there appears to be little to no performance preference around the outcome,\u201d he said in a September report. \u201cThe only potentially meaningful outcome appears to be a minority government versus a majority government.\u201dSince 1935, Canadian stocks have returned on average 12 per cent in the 12 months after the election of a minority government, compared with 8 per cent in the year following a majority victory, according to Belski\u2019s research.For others, volatility is the name of the game. Stripping out the global rout in 2008, National Bank Financial\u2019s Warren Lovely said that Canadian stocks had a \u201cmixed/choppy\u201d performance after a minority government was formed from 2004 to 2011.\u201cIn terms of capital markets, the formation of a minority government creates greater potential uncertainty \u2013 especially if a coalition government is the end result,\u201d Credit Suisse\u2019s equity analyst Andrew Kuske said in an Oct. 8 report.Still, election-related market moves might be short-lived this month with both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve reporting their monetary policy decisions on Oct. 30. Futures traders are pricing in almost no probability of a rate cut at the BOC meeting, while a quarter point reduction from the Fed is seen as likely by the market. Canadian two-year yields on Wednesday climbed above their U.S. equivalents by the most since 2017 \u2014 a good sign for loonie bulls.Trade deals will also have an impact on the Canadian dollar. The U.S. and China are still working to finalize their trade deal, which is likely to boost investors\u2019 appetite for risk, a positive for the currency. And on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC that he expects the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to be approved in Congress before the American Thanksgiving holiday.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s job market on track for one of its best years on record", "description": "The economy gains 53,700 job, blowing past forecasts", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/newsalert-national-unemployment-rate-down-after-country-adds-54000-jobs-in-september", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jobs2.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 11, 2019 11:50 AM EDT", "content": "Canada posted another surprisingly strong month of job gains in a labour market that is on track for one of its best years on record.The economy added 53,700 jobs last month, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, following a gain of 81,100 in August.

Fat paycheques and generous overtime earlier this decade fuelled big spending on customized pickups and million-dollar homes. With work drying up, the bill has come due.Consumer insolvency filings in the Fort McMurray district climbed 39 per cent in 2018, the largest percentage increase in Canada, federal data show. Claims against property, the first step in the foreclosure process, surged almost tenfold over the past three years, according to court records. The city\u2019s 90-day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans climbed to 1.75 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.12 per cent nationally, according to Equifax Canada.The five-year slump that\u2019s cut oil prices in half since 2014 has been a driver in the bust. What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oilsands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oilsands as a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.Stewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada\u2019s federal election later this month. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and pledges to remove regulations Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.In May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s Fort Hills oilsands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.Richardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He\u2019d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.After the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he\u2019s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as cancelling his family\u2019s cable subscription.\u201cI spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,\u201d Richardson, 42, said. He\u2019s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. \u201cI never got into all the toys. I\u2019m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn\u2019t have to sell everything off like some other people. I\u2019ve seen a lot of that. It\u2019s like a fire sale.\u201dThe energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It\u2019s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.The potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oilsands are the world\u2019s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested $210.1 billion (US$157.7 billion), more than last year\u2019s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day. Canada shot up from the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest, overtaking Iran, Mexico and Norway.It was a heady time.Tax revenue and corporate sponsorships paid for a revamp of the Fort McMurray International Airport, improvements to schools, top-notch hockey facilities and a gleaming new recreation centre, where Carrie Underwood was a recent headliner.The city\u2019s population doubled as workers crowded in from around the country, sending rents and home prices surging and prompting a cascade of typical boomtown challenges, from crazy traffic to crowded schools. Companies, desperate for labour, threw six-figure salaries at low-skill jobs and covered commuting costs for roughnecks and people from as far away as Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast. Median annual household incomes more than doubled from 2001 to 2011, to about $181,000.Then oil prices tanked. The pipeline plans stalled. International giants, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sold off their major oilsands assets. Capital investments are on track to decline for a fifth straight year to an estimated $12 billion this year, about one-third of the 2014 level, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.Several operators \u2014 Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and a few others \u2014 are still active and generally profitable. But they\u2019ve managed that by cutting costs, including, of course, that of labour.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting the overtime that they used to get, or they\u2019re not getting any overtime at all,\u201d said Sandra Landry, an insolvency trustee at MNP Ltd.If things weren\u2019t bad enough when oil bottomed around US$26 a barrel in early 2016, the largest wildfire in recent history swept through the Fort Mac area that May. It forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses, making it the country\u2019s costliest natural disaster.\u201cThe housing market is down, there\u2019s the economic downturn and there\u2019s still the recovery from the fire,\u201d said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. Home prices remain 44 per cent below the recent peak.Sean O\u2019Byrne moved to Fort Mac from Grande Prairie, Alberta, after the fire to open a branch of a friend\u2019s siding business to repair damaged houses. That work dried up in November. Now he\u2019s selling cars, making far less than the $1,000 a day he could rake in with the siding business; customers at the General Motors dealership are no longer trading in for new models every two years. He and his wife have cut back on travel and moved to a cheaper apartment closer to their children\u2019s school, saving $900 in rent, he said while sipping coffee in a Tim Hortons doughnut shop facing a forested area, where charred trees stick out among new growth.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t spending money like they used to,\u201d he said.They likely won\u2019t be in the near future. There are only a few projects on the horizon that would create many new jobs. Teck Resources Ltd.\u2019s proposed $20-billion Frontier mine is in the early stages of the regulatory-approval process. Imperial Oil Ltd., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., has put its long-planned $2.6-billion Aspen mine on hold, waiting to see if the pipeline situation improves.There aren\u2019t many bets being laid that it will. More than a few folks would rather it not. Since the frenzy died down, traffic has returned to normal, in part because the oil money helped build a new bridge, over the Athabasca river. The unemployment rate, which skyrocketed to around 10 per cent in 2016, has settled down to 6.3 per cent mostly a function of workers decamping for more promising prospects.\u201cThat massive boom and gold-rush mentality that took place \u2014 I would rather not relive that,\u201d said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus, adding the entire industry has learned the benefits of measured growth.These days, the company will only consider expansion projects that will be profitable with the benchmark U.S. oil price at US$45 a barrel, about US$10 less than the current level. Some oilsands projects undertaken a decade ago required US$100 a barrel to break even.John Hickey is also content with the slowdown. A mechanic who works on used oil-industry vehicles, he lost his house in the wildfire. Two years ago, a builder quoted him $500,000. The offers keep moving down, and he\u2019s waiting for one to get to $200,000 or so before going ahead.In the meantime, he\u2019s sharing a one-bedroom condo with a friend, sleeping in a tent in the living room to give himself a bit of privacy. He still has work and has always lived within his means, a lesson for places like Fort Mac that can see the money go as quickly as it came, he said.Too many, he said, \u201cmade a lifestyle based on an economy that wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rich Miller and Steve Matthews", "title": "Jerome Powell says Fed to resume portfolio growth  \u2014 but it's not QE", "description": "Purchases will made up of Treasury bills, stresses buying should not be seen as return of crisis-era quantitative easing programs", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/jerome-powell-says-fed-to-resume-portfolio-growth-but-its-not-qe", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 8, 2019 2:59 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will resume purchases of Treasury securities in an effort to avoid a repeat of recent turmoil in money markets, while leaving his options open on interest rates weeks ahead of policy makers\u2019 next meeting.\u201cMy colleagues and I will soon announce measures to add to the supply of reserves over time,\u201d he said in the text of a speech to be delivered Tuesday to the National Association of Business Economics in Denver.He suggested that the purchases would be made up of Treasury bills and stressed the buying should not be seen as a return of the crisis-era quantitative easing programs that the Fed engaged in a decade ago to boost the economy. Three-month bill yields fell on the comments, while U.S. stocks pared losses and the dollar was higher.\u201cI want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy.\u201dThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year to shelter the U.S. economy from weak global growth and trade-policy uncertainty. Traders in federal funds futures are betting that the Federal Open Market Committee will reduce rates again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting from the current target range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.Powell was non-committal on what the Fed\u2019s next move would be.\u201cLooking ahead, policy is not on a preset course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next FOMC meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.\u201dHe said the actions that the Fed has already taken \u201care providing support for the outlook,\u201d which remains favorable but faces risks, principally from global developments such as trade and Brexit.But he added, \u201cwe will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 per cent objective.\u201dThe economy has recently shown signs of slowing as weakness overseas has spread to the U.S. and moved from domestic manufacturing industries to services.The job market has also downshifted, even as unemployment has fallen to a half-century low of 3.5 per cent. Nonfarm payrolls grew by an average of 157,000 per month in the third quarter, compared with gains above 200,000 earlier in the expansion.Powell said that work done by the Fed mining private-sector data suggested the most recent job gains may ultimately be revised lower, but that the pace would still be above the level needed to hold unemployment steady.Money markets were roiled last month as a combination of corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury debt purchases temporarily sent short-term interest rates skyrocketing.The Fed announced last week that it will extend through October the ad hoc liquidity lifeline that it\u2019s been offering to U.S. funding markets since then.\u201cWe will not hesitate to conduct temporary operations if needed to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range,\u201d Powell said.\u201cAs we indicated in our March statement on balance sheet normalization, at some point, we will begin increasing our securities holdings to maintain an appropriate level of reserves,\u201d he added. \u201cThat time is now upon us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Welch", "title": "GM strike ripples across the economy, raising new recession fears", "description": "The strike has chopped US$400 million in direct wages out of the U.S. economy, with half of that loss coming in Michigan", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/gm-strike-ripples-across-economy-raising-new-recession-fears?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/strike-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 7, 2019 10:59 AM EDT", "content": "Here in the heart of America\u2019s car industry, car parts have nowhere to go.Eighty-five tractor trailers full of hoods, bumpers and other assorted parts sat, unloaded, in Lansing, Michigan, this week \u2014 more evidence of the cost of the General Motors Co. strike that has shut down most of its North American plants and idled 46,000 workers.Soon to enter its fourth week, the strike is rippling across the economy, from parts suppliers in Michigan and Canada to bars, restaurants and other businesses that serve employees who now find themselves tight on cash. The layoffs have added to fears that a weakened manufacturing sector could tip the economy into recession \u2014 potentially playing a role in next year\u2019s election especially in a swing state like Michigan.\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurt,\u201d said Mike Luna, a warehouse worker and a chairman of United Auto Workers Local 652, which is made up of striking GM workers and many laid off supplier employees.Luna works at a Ryder Integrated Logistics warehouse, where about 500 workers have been laid off, leaving the semi-trailers in the parking lot. They are chock full of auto parts destined for one of two nearby GM plants: Hoods and painted body panels for Chevrolet Camaros; and hinges, hubcaps and exhaust systems for Cadillac sedans, Buick SUVs and Chevys.The automaker itself has already lost more than US$1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, according to one analyst estimate. GM\u2019s bigger parts suppliers are losing as much as US$2 million a day by the same measurement. Workers at smaller parts makers across the U.S. are sending employees home.It's a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurtIn Michigan, parts workers furloughed by the walkout do not get strike pay and just this week began receiving state unemployment benefits that max out at US$342 a week \u2014 not enough for most of his co-workers to live on, Luna said. Striking workers at GM get even less from a UAW rainy day fund, just US$250 a week.In a letter to members dated Friday, Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s vice president in charge of talks with GM, said \u201cgood progress\u201d has been made negotiating issues such as health care and the treatment of temporary workers.The parties have moved closer to a deal but two sticking points remain. They are employee pension plans and shortening the length of time required for entry-level workers to earn top hourly pay of US$28, according to people familiar with the matter on Saturday.The strike comes at a potential inflection point for America\u2019s economy. New statistics last week showed a sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing in September.The GM strike isn\u2019t helping. It\u2019s chopped US$400 million in direct wages out of the U.S. economy, with half of that loss coming in Michigan, Patrick Anderson, chief executive officer of Anderson Economic Group in Lansing, estimated. The U.S. Treasury has lost US$154 million so far just in payroll and income taxes.In the southeast Michigan economy, a factory-heavy region, the layoffs have shaved off 1.8 per cent of earned income, he said. If that trend lasts for a quarter, \u201cthe chances of southeast Michigan going into a recession are pretty high,\u201d Anderson said in an interview.The impact stretches beyond Michigan. Canadian components maker Linamar Corp., which makes metal parts for drivetrains like camshafts and transmission cases, said Wednesday the sudden drop in GM orders is costing it up to one million Canadian dollars (US$750,000) a day in lost revenue. Shares of the supplier slid as much as 13.8 per cent Thursday to a six-year low.The walkout has forced American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. to lay off workers at its largest driveline plant in the U.S. The company, which was spun off from GM in 1994, still relies on the automaker for 39 per cent of its revenue. CEO David Dauch told Bloomberg last week his company may adjust its full-year earnings outlook if the strike continues for \u201can extended period of time.\u201d Its stock has fallen 18 per cent since the labour action began on Sept. 16.The strike is costing Axle and Lear Corp., another big supplier, US$2 million a day each while the toll on parts-maker Tenneco Inc. is US$1 million daily, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.GM and its suppliers can make up some production once the strike ends, but not all of it. So some profit will either be lost or shifted to next year.\u201cWe are getting to the point where it will be difficult to recover the lost production this year,\u201d Spak wrote in a research note. \u201cIn some respects, that makes the remainder of 2019 somewhat of a throwaway for the group and could shift the focus to 2020.\u201dFrom the union\u2019s perspective, GM turned out record profits over the life of the expired four-year deal and CEO Mary Barra made more than US$66 million. It wants a pay raise, especially for newer employees who start at less than US$20 an hour, and a clear path for temporary workers to become full-timers making US$30 an hour.GM is looking to hold costs down, arguing that its current total compensation package of US$63 an hour is already more than that offered by Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler and the Japanese plants in the U.S.While the two sides wrestle over those and a few other issues, furloughed parts workers struggle to make do. At Ryder and most of the smaller suppliers, workers make around US$15 an hour. Union leader Luna said he cautioned workers a year ago to save for the strike. But at that wage, which equates to US$31,000 a year without overtime, many workers live check to check.Some employees have gone to the United Way and other charities for help with buying food and other essentials, he said. A few have applied for new jobs, but that\u2019s a tough sell.\u201cThey are trying to get work,\u201d Luna said, \u201cbut then you have to tell an employer that when the strike ends, you would go back.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "From housing prices to childcare to transit, Canadian voters are feeling tight on cash", "description": "Politicians are trying to turn financial anxiety into votes by promising tax cuts and other initiatives to make life more affordable", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/why-affordability-is-dominating-canadas-election-campaign", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wallet.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2019 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters.Though broad economic data show the nation\u2019s economy is humming along, Canadians are still feeling tight on cash. The worsening global outlook and unprecedented policy uncertainty are adding to the apprehension.Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with the leaders of smaller parties are seeking to parlay that stress into votes as the clock winds down on the Oct. 21 election, by promising a slew of tax cuts and other measures to make life more affordable for Canadians.\u201cPoliticians are putting their finger on something, some form of financial anxiety about rising costs, or concerns about future rising costs, or future standard of living,\u201d said Jennifer Robson, associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa.Here\u2019s why consumers are feeling pinched.It\u2019s old news that owning a home in Canada\u2019s biggest cities has become an almost impossible goal for much of the middle class. Skyrocketing prices in recent years pushed potential buyers to the sidelines. New mortgage lending rules, so-called stress tests introduced by federal regulators in 2017, put ownership even further out of reach for many.Toronto and Vancouver are easily Canada\u2019s two main cities where residents are struggling to find an affordable place to live. The average selling price for a single family home in Vancouver was $1.51 million (US$1.13 million) in September, and $1.1 million in Toronto. Renting in those cities is no easy feat either as low vacancy rates have pushed up prices for accommodation.Elevated real estate prices are the main driver of the country\u2019s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. Buyers took out larger and larger mortgages as the housing market heated up, even as incomes failed to keep pace. As a result, household savings rates are hovering near the lowest in decades and the debt service ratio \u2014 which measures the share of disposable income paid toward principal and interest \u2014 climbed to a record in the second quarter.While overall price inflation in Canada has been relatively benign, shoppers have experienced sticker shock on many basics. Prices for fruits and vegetables jumped as much as 60 per cent in the past decade, according to Statistics Canada. Childcare and tuition costs rose upwards of 35 per cent and public transit prices ballooned by 50 per cent.To top it all off, wages after accounting for inflation have remained relatively flat, even as costs for rent and basic goods increased. A puzzle for many economists and policy makers is why unemployment is hovering near record lows, yet incomes are struggling to pick up.The financial pressure on Canadians isn\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon, with the worldwide economic outlook dimming. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to 3.2 per cent. A rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009. Adding to the tension, many workers are worried about robots displacing jobs and the financial impact of an aging population.\u201cThat\u2019s the emotional side of this issue that doesn\u2019t show up in any CPI index or economic data,\u201d said David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus Data. \u201cIt\u2019s in the head and the parties are clearly recognizing that emotional side is important. It\u2019s like an arms race right now in Canada to offer up who can save us the most money.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Fergal O'Brien and Michelle Jamrisko", "title": "Trade conflicts are hitting the global economy with an impact reminiscent of the 1930s", "description": "Warning signs mounted today with wave of data showing slumping manufacturing", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/world-economy-sends-up-new-flares-amid-growing-industrial-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/route66.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 1, 2019 9:48 AM EDT", "content": "The global economy flashed louder warning signs on Tuesday as a wave of data showed manufacturing stuck in a slump, exports falling and sentiment sliding.Industry executives from Japan and Russia to Germany and Italy complained of contracting business, while the spectre of deflation resurfaced as South Korea, a bellwether for international trade, reported a drop in consumer prices. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its interest rate to a record low and said it may ease further.There can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptionsAlthough a measure of Chinese manufacturing improved, the overall tone was of the world economy failing to rebound from the slowdown that has plagued it for the whole of this year amid mounting trade tensions. That leaves the U.S. and China under pressure to resolve their differences as well central bankers and governments to find ways to support demand.\u201cThere can be few precedents since the 1930s of global growth prospects being affected so significantly by trade policy disruptions,\u201d Fitch Chief Economist Brian Coulton said.The WTO cut its 2019 trade growth forecast by more than half to 1.2 per cent, and warned that further rounds of tariffs could spark a \u201cdestructive cycle of recrimination.\u201dUBS Group AG economists reckon global expansion is tracking just 2.3 per cent at the moment, almost a percentage point less than the start of the third quarter. Those at Danske Bank are warning there is a 30 per cent chance of a global recession in the next two years.While global trade tensions are part of the story, there\u2019s also industry specific issues \u2014 autos in Germany, semiconductors in South Korea \u2014 adding to the hurdles.German car-parts giant Continental AG last month laid out a sweeping restructuring plan that could affect as many as 20,000 jobs worldwide. Japan\u2019s Kawasaki Heavy Industries cut its forecasts, citing sales to chipmakers.Central banks around the world are fighting the slowdown with rate cuts and monetary stimulus. But they are also ramping up calls on governments to jump in too with fiscal measures, saying they can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting.In the meantime, global bond investors are betting against a meaningful inflation pickup. Even with sovereign yields below zero, they are still piling into government debt, and so-called deflation trades are on the rise. Germany\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs are at minus 0.5 per cent.The latest Purchasing Managers Indexes may reinforce those views. German manufacturers cut prices in September by the most in more than three years. In Japan, where manufacturing sentiment is declining, factories lowered selling prices for a fourth straight month. British companies warned of \u201cBrexit uncertainty and clients routing supply chains away from the U.K.\u201dSuch an environment is worrying for central bankers with inflation already low and well short of targets. Consumer-price growth in Germany and the euro area slipped below 1 per cent in September for the first time since 2016. For the latter, that\u2019s far short of the European Central Bank\u2019s goal.In the U.K., the PMI reading improved, but still remained below the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.China\u2019s numbers were mixed. The Caixin/IHS Markit measure to 51.4 in September from 50.4 in August. The nation\u2019s official PMI was less upbeat \u2014 edging up to 49.8 from 49.5.Parts of the global economy still show resilience. Services are growing, and falling unemployment is supporting consumer spending. U.S.-China trade negotiations remain a critical risk for the outlook, with a Chinese delegation set to visit Washington for further talks this month aimed at hammering out a deal.\u201cWe would hear a great sigh of relief form central banks around the world if the trade situation were to be somewhat resolved,\u201d Holger Schmieding, Berenberg Bank chief economist, said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cI\u2019d be positively surprised if we had a lasting resolution within the next few months.

Switchboard operators were done in by the dawn of direct dialling. And in the car industry, auto workers are deathly afraid the engine assembler will give way to battery builders.Dread over the prospect that plug-in cars \u2014 which have fewer parts and require less labour to build \u2014 will doom auto jobs helped spark the first United Auto Workers strike against General Motors Co. in over a decade. Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which are rolling their own battery-powered models to market in the coming years, could face a similar fate if they\u2019re unable to quell the UAW\u2019s concerns that widespread adoption of EVs endangers the employment of 35,000 union members.\u201cThere\u2019s a potential for our jobs to be gone \u2014 they don\u2019t need us anymore,\u201d said Tim Walbolt, president of the UAW local representing workers at a Fiat Chrysler transmission components plant near Toledo, Ohio. \u201cIt scares us.\u201dFor all the buzz generated by Tesla Inc., the EV era is still in its infancy, with zero-emission autos having reached just 2 per cent of global production. GM has extended the UAW an offer to get in on the ground floor, pitching a new battery plant staffed by dues-paying union members in an Ohio town jarred by job loss. But the overture came with a catch: GM wants to pay the workers less, and the facility is unlikely to need as many staff as an engine or transmission factory would.A recent study of electric-vehicle production in Europe by consultant AlixPartners found that it took 40 per cent fewer hours to assemble an electric motor and battery than a traditional internal-combustion engine and transmission.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad news story from a labour perspective,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, the head of AlixPartners\u2019s automotive practice. \u201cYou would just fundamentally need less people.\u201dPerversely, GM also arguably has uncertainty on it\u2019s side at the bargaining table. It\u2019s going to want concessions to cushion itself against the risk that consumer adoption of electric autos remains slow. The carmaker isn\u2019t fully utilizing the factory that builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV north of Detroit, and tepid demand for the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt put the future of the factory that assembles it in nearby Hamtramck in doubt.The collision with carmakers over electrification is one the UAW saw coming.\u201cElectric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membership,\u201d Jennifer Kelly, the union\u2019s research director, said during a collective-bargaining conference in Detroit earlier this year.It\u2019s almost certain to carry over from the UAW\u2019s talks with GM to negotiations with Detroit\u2019s other automakers. Ford has estimated electric cars will require 30 per cent fewer hours of labor per vehicle and 50 per cent less factory floor space.\u201cRationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition,\u201d Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s automotive president, told investors on an earnings call in April.Electric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membershipEven Fiat Chrysler, a laggard with regard to electrification, has stoked fear at union halls linked to internal-combustion components plants, where rumours are flying that the company plans to outsource work to lower-paying suppliers.\u201cWe cannot help but feel like the left behind stepchildren of the UAW,\u201d Mike Booth, the president of the union\u2019s local in Marysville, Michigan, wrote in a letter to the labour group\u2019s Chrysler council last month. He and other UAW leaders fear that German mega-supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which took over operation of a Chrysler axle plant in 2008, will take work away from the automaker\u2019s machining facility near Toledo and a transmission and castings complex in Kokomo, Indiana.A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said the operations the union are concerned about are critical to the business. ZF will continue to work with the UAW in Marysville, and an arrangement in which Fiat Chrysler licenses technology from the supplier in Kokomo may be creating some confusion, a spokesman said. He declined to comment on Toledo.In August, GM shut down a transmission plant outside Detroit, affecting more than 260 workers as part of a larger restructuring. That may foreshadow other closures as EV production ramps up. The supply chain is where the job risk is greatest, especially for workers employed making engines, transmissions and sub-components that aren\u2019t needed in EVs.Consultant IHS Markit predicts the introduction of new gas-powered engine families will drop to zero in 2022, from nearly 70 in 2011, as automakers shift spending to electric propulsion. The market for a whole range of parts used in internal combustion vehicles \u2014 such as axles, mufflers, fuel tanks and transmissions \u2014 will shrink in a range from 6 per cent to 20 per cent by 2025, according to a study by Deloitte Consulting.\u201cThe value chain is shifting and companies and their unions are going to have to figure out how to change themselves or risk becoming part of a shrinking bubble,\u201d said Neal Ganguli, head of the auto supply base group at Deloitte\u2019s U.S. automotive practice.That\u2019s a problem because engines and transmissions currently account for just under half of automaker manufacturing capacity, Credit Suisse auto analyst Dan Levy estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors. As a result, automakers may face labour, social and political challenges as they transition to EVs, he wrote.GM\u2019s EV factory in Lake Orion, Michigan, offers a window into what the UAW is worried about.While the plant is unionized, the automaker staffs it in part with lower-wage employees under a special contract. What\u2019s more, 64 per cent of the fully electric Bolt model\u2019s content is made in Korea, including the battery.One of the biggest suppliers is Seoul-based LG Chem Ltd., which makes cells in South Korea and assembles packs for GM and Fiat Chrysler at a non-union plant in western Michigan with a starting wage for technicians of US$16 an hour.The UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they'll have a rough timeThat\u2019s close to what Ford pays its entry-level temporary workers, but far below the US$28 to US$30 an hour for legacy UAW employees. Temp workers at Ford\u2019s engine and transmission plants also can move up into legacy wage brackets, which isn\u2019t the case at LG\u2019s facility.\u201cThe move to electric could weaken the union further,\u201d Joshua Murray, a labour expert and assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University. \u201cCertainly, the UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they\u2019ll have a rough time.\u201dNo major automaker entirely outsources engines, in no small part thanks to displacement and horsepower being the source of marketing buzz and bragging rights for decades. EVs are a different story \u2014 even Tesla relies heavily on Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp. in the making of its battery packs.Batteries \u2014 the single most expensive part of an electric vehicle \u2014 are almost exclusively manufactured overseas and mostly by companies relatively new to the automotive powertrain, such as China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation Co.SK Innovation broke ground earlier this year on a new battery factory outside of Atlanta, which will employ some 2,000 non-union workers. And CEO Jun Kim thinks carmakers will have a tough time replicating what his company does.\u201cThere is a difference between the DNA of automakers and battery makers such as us,\u201d Kim said in a March interview. \u201cThere are only a handful of battery suppliers that are capable of delivering high-quality products while guaranteeing cost competitiveness.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Trudeau pledges to cut Canadians\u2019 cellphone bills by 25% within four years", "description": "Also promises to raise basic personal income tax deduction, saving average family $585 a year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/trudeau-pledges-to-cut-taxes-for-middle-class-lower-phone-bills", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cellphone.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 23, 2019 8:10 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party is pledging to raise the basic personal income tax deduction and lower cell phone bills if re-elected next month.The Liberals would raise the basic personal income tax deduction \u2014 the threshold under which no taxes are paid \u2014 to $15,000 for people earning under $147,000.

They also plan to award new wireless spectrum on the basis of consumer choice and affordability, and not simply the highest bids.\u201cCell phone bills in particular put a lot of pressure on a family\u2019s budget, with Canadians paying up to twice as much for wireless services than people in other G7 countries,\u201d the party said in the statement.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Last time Canada\u2019s economy gained this many jobs in a year it was 2003", "description": "More ammunition for Bank of Canada to buck the global easing trend", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-jobs-market-surprises-again-with-monster-gain?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hiring2.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 6, 2019 10:53 AM EDT", "content": "Canada recorded one of its best months of job gains on record in August, a surprising show of strength by a labour market that has been relentlessly powering the nation\u2019s expansion.The economy added 81,100 last month, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus expectations for a gain of about 20,000.

The only other months with negative returns over the same period were October, June and January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Don\u2019t write off September just yet though, as the month has had its share of gains. The index has risen six of the last 10 Septembers, though massive declines in 2011, 2014 and 2015 pushed the average lower.Investors can be forgiven for wanting to see August behind them. Global trade tensions roiled markets throughout the month, leading to wild swings amid the China-U.S. showdown. After all the noise however, the benchmark climbed 0.2 per cent for the month, after the best weekly gain since January as energy and mining stocks rallied with commodities.Further along the Canadian equity train ride, the next stop is \u2018Hobnob Station.\u2019Investors will head to conferences in Toronto and New York to hear from senior executives of major Canadian companies about their growth plans and the state of their industries. There will also be plenty of time for dinners, drinks and one-on-one meetings.In Toronto, two events stand out:Scotiabank Financials Summit (Sept. 4-5): Presenters include C-Suite executives of the Big Six banks, life insurers like Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., and private equity firm Onex Corp.Toronto Global Forum (Sept. 4-6): Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci \u2014 who has set up a political action committee in a bid to prevent Donald Trump\u2019s re-election \u2014 will speak along with the CEOs of various Canadian corporations and Canadian provincial and federal ministers.For Manhattan, investors are set to gather at the Sheraton Times Square Hotel for Barclays\u2019 annual CEO Energy-Power conference, where majors like Suncor Energy Inc. will make presentations.There\u2019s one major event that will have economists and market participants on edge: Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decision day on Sept. 4. While most expect no rate change, Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s comments on monetary policy will be watched closely, especially after GDP expanded 3.7 per cent in the second quarter, beating the 3 per cent estimate.

Additionally, Hudson\u2019s Bay will take a stake in Le Tote and get two seats on the board. That stake will be 25 per cent, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because that detail hasn\u2019t been made public.Le Tote will operate 38 Lord & Taylor stores, according to the statement. Another five are set to shut down, according to the person. Previous closures of the chain have included the flagship Manhattan location. The San Francisco-based company said it will extend employment offers to \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Lord & Taylor employees.The statement confirms an earlier report by Bloomberg News.The deal gives the Canadian retailer a way to divest operations of the struggling Lord & Taylor chain while holding onto the more valuable asset \u2014 the real estate on which the stores are located. It also lets Hudson\u2019s Bay focus on better-performing units such as Saks Fifth Avenue. However, Hudson\u2019s Bay will still be responsible for making Lord & Taylor\u2019s rent payments for at least three years, which it estimates at about $77 million (US$57.9 million) per year.The transaction, expected to close at the start of the 2019 holiday season, gives Hudson\u2019s Bay some measure of flexibility in the future: Starting in 2021, both companies will have options to reassess the store network. Hudson\u2019s Bay could then look into redeveloping some properties, including for mixed use.The move is Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes\u2019s latest attempt to turn around the company, after selling flash-sale e-commerce site Gilt and cashing out of European operations. The deal brings together \u201cfashion rental subscriptions with traditional retail,\u201d she said in the statement.Meanwhile, the company is also mulling an offer by company Chairman Richard Baker and his partners, who collectively own about 57 per cent of Hudson\u2019s Bay, to take the company private.Hudson\u2019s Bay shares are up 39 per cent this year, largely related to Baker\u2019s offer.Le Tote, based in San Francisco, was founded in 2012 and is backed by firms that include Lerer Hippeau, Azure Capital and Simon Ventures. The company offers monthly boxes of apparel items that users can purchase or return after use. The company is in the process of securing financing for the full purchase price, according to the statement.Lord & Taylor generated $1.4 billion of revenue in fiscal 2018, Hudson\u2019s Bay said.

Powell described the rate reduction at the time as \u201ca mid-cycle adjustment to policy,\u201d telling reporters on July 31 that it wasn\u2019t the beginning of a long series of cuts.But in his remarks Friday, he noted that events since that meeting \u201chave been eventful.\u201d\u201cWe have seen further evidence of a global slowdown, notably in Germany and China.

He broke the analysis into three long-run questions: Can the central bank restrain inflation? Can the central bank buffer inevitable financial excess? Can the central bank still provide stimulus and counter-cyclical policy in a time of very low interest rates?He answered the first two positively, saying that the Fed has the tools to quell inflation, while the post-crisis financial system is more resilient and monitoring has improved.

For Houston-based Kinder, the deal completes an exit from a country that has frustrated more than a few companies \u2014 from ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to Marathon Oil Corp.The drumbeat of exits, rare for such a stable oil-producing country, adds an extra layer of gloom for an industry that accounts for about a fifth of Canada\u2019s exports. The energy sector \u2014 centred around Alberta\u2019s oilsands \u2014 has struggled to rebound since the 2014 crash in global oil prices, with capital spending declining for five straight years and job cuts pushing the province\u2019s unemployment rate above 6 per cent. Alberta is forecast to post the slowest growth of any region in Canada this year.The situation isn\u2019t likely to improve any time soon, with key pipelines like TC Energy Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL and Enbridge Inc.\u2019s expansion of its Line 3 conduit bogged down by legal challenges. The lack of pipelines has weighed on Canadian heavy crude prices for years, sending them to a record low late in 2018.\u201cIf they thought things were getting better in Canada, they might hold on, but they don\u2019t see things getting better,\u201d Laura Lau, who helps manage more than $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. \u201cThe pipeline situation is getting worse; everything is getting worse.\u201dOther recent major exits include ConocoPhillips\u2019 US$13.2 billion sale of its oilsands and natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc. in 2017, and Shell\u2019s and Marathon\u2019s sales of their stakes in an oil-sands project to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for about US$10.7 billion that same year. Canadian Natural also bought Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp.\u2019s Canadian heavy oil assets this year for US$2.79 billion. Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA pulled out in 2016 after facing pressure at home to invest in lower-emission projects.The pipeline situation is getting worse; everything is getting worseWhile a government curtailment program has boosted oilsands prices to more normal levels, the system has prevented companies from investing in new deposits. What\u2019s more, the oilsands are often viewed by investors as a higher-cost jurisdiction that produces a lower quality of heavy crude. Those persistent drags are likely to keep Canadian assets at the top of international companies\u2019 lists for potential disposal, Lau said.Kinder Morgan is in many ways the perfect example of the troubles \u2014 including slow-moving regulatory processes, an active environmental movement, and a variety of inter-provincial squabbles. The company bought the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries crude and other products from Edmonton to a shipping terminal in Vancouver, for about US$5.6 billion in 2005 in a bid to gain exposure to the oilsands \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves.But a plan to roughly triple the capacity of the line got bogged down amid opposition from indigenous groups, environmentalists and British Columbia\u2019s government. Kinder threatened to scrap the expansion, which all but forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government to step in and buy the entire line for about US$3.45 billion last year.\u201cWhen they sold Trans Mountain, there wasn\u2019t much left, and it was just a matter of time for them to exit Canada completely,\u201d Lau said. \u201cBut definitely another foreign company exiting Canada doesn\u2019t send a good signal.\u201dNot all foreign operators have abandoned Canada. Exxon Mobil Corp. still has a sizable presence with its controlling stake in Imperial Oil Ltd., a $25-billion company. Shell, based in The Hague, still owns a refining complex and natural gas production in Alberta and British Columbia. France\u2019s Total SA owns a portion of the Fort Hills mine, and Japanese and Chinese companies also have oilsands projects.A potential catalyst for the sector could be the election of a Conservative government in Canada\u2019s federal election in October, said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial. That may change global investors\u2019 perceptions about the support the industry would receive from the government.\u201cThe silver lining in this whole process is that Canada owns Canada again, and we got it pretty cheap,\u201d Tahmazian said in an interview. \u201cNow the question is can we take advantage of that by allowing ourselves a more friendly environment for foreign investment?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "A Bank of Canada rate cut is looking more likely and the first could come as early as September", "description": "A slowing economy and growing trade tensions suggest a cut will happen more quickly than currently accounted for, Macquarie economist says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/a-bank-of-canada-rate-cut-is-looking-more-likely-and-the-first-could-come-as-early-as-september?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/bank-of-canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 20, 2019 9:23 AM EDT", "content": "More economists are coming around to the view the Bank of Canada will have to cut rates this year, with a move as early as September looking increasingly possible.A slowing Canadian economy, along with a deterioration in global demand and growing trade tensions, suggest a downward move from the central bank is likely to happen more quickly than currently accounted for, according to David Doyle, an economist at Macquarie Capital Markets in Toronto.Implied odds show investors are assigning only a 20 per cent chance of a cut at the central bank\u2019s next decision on Sept. 4. One rate cut by December is fully priced, as is one more cut by June next year. That may not be quick enough, especially with the country\u2019s yield curve inverting to the point that historically has presaged central bank easing, Doyle said.\u201cIn the event that we are heading into a global recession and things turn ugly and you get rising unemployment rates globally, then Canada is going to have to ease, maybe even more than the U.S.,\u201d Doyle said in a telephone interview.Macquarie is assigning a more than 50 per cent chance of a cut in September, plus another cut in October.Scotiabank also revised its rate outlook last Friday, predicting one rate cut this year from the Bank of Canada no later than at its Oct. 30 decision, and as early as Sept. 4. A second cut would come early in 2020. It based the revision on the view the U.S.-China trade war will persist through Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201cRisks to the Canadian economy are on the rise,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Perrault, Scotiabank\u2019s chief economist, said in a note to clients. \u201cDependent as it is on international trade, Canada cannot be immune to the rising tide of protectionism.\u201dPerrault is more sanguine about the domestic outlook than Doyle. He believes Canadian economic conditions don\u2019t warrant rate cuts, but the heightened global uncertainty requires a cautious tone.\u201cWe now believe the Bank of Canada will follow those that cut rates to insure against potential damage,\u201d Perrault said.Economists and markets have been expecting fewer moves, and a slower pace of cutting from Canada, for a number of reasons. The nation\u2019s economy probably grew at a faster pace in the second quarter than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms, unlike the U.S., and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank\u2019s target.Risks to the Canadian economy are on the riseBut historically it\u2019s also rare for Canada to be so out of sync with the Fed, which has already cut its policy rate once and is seen moving again three more times over the next six months.As of Aug. 16, implied odds based on cash forward rates show investors are pricing in 37 basis points of easing over the next six months for the Bank of Canada, versus 81 points for the Fed. The discrepancy in expectations for Canadian and U.S. policy moves has been averaging the widest since 2010.Regardless, Doyle expects the domestic economic data to make a turn for the worse in the next few months. Inflation pressures are likely to moderate, particularly as mortgage costs fall, business investment looks uncertain, and inventories have built up to recession-era levels, all of which point to a softer second half for the Canadian economy, Doyle said in a recent research report.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg and Catarina Saraiva", "title": "Economists still think Bank of Canada will keep interest rates on hold, bucking global easing trend", "description": "Key indicators continue to beat expectations with growth in the second quarter tracking faster than expected", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/economists-still-think-bank-of-canada-will-keep-interest-rates-on-hold-bucking-global-easing-trend?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/poloz-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 9, 2019 1:18 PM EDT", "content": "Most economists aren\u2019t budging in their prediction Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will hold interest rates steady for at least another year.Even with renewed speculation about an impending global recession and a trend among the world\u2019s central banks toward easing policy, a Bloomberg survey shows a majority of economists still expect Poloz to keep the benchmark overnight rate at 1.75 per cent until the end of 2020. That\u2019s counter to the expectation of markets, where forward rates point to some easing over the same period.The surprising robustness of the domestic economy may be keeping the bulk of analysts in the more hawkish camp. As global trade uncertainty mounts, key Canadian indicators continue to beat expectations \u2014 including back-to-back trade surpluses \u2014 with growth in the second quarter tracking faster than expected.\u201cPoloz will need to see a substantial weakening in domestic data before the bank changes its stance,\u201d Dominique Lapointe, an economist at Laurentian Bank, said by phone from Montreal. \u201cThe extent to which global tensions translate into lower business investment and exports in Canada has yet to be seen.\u201dOf the 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, nine expect the Bank of Canada to remain on hold to the end of 2020. Domestic banks are among the more optimistic \u2014 with Toronto Dominion, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, National Bank and Laurentian expecting Poloz to hold well into next year.But not all are convinced, with six analysts predicting at least one cut amid escalating U.S.-China trade tension that is raising doubts about the global growth outlook, and which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week.Trade and investment are most at risk for Canada. While underlying export strength is at its strongest since 2015, evidence of slowing global demand is mounting. Inventory-to-sales ratios are at recession-era highs in both the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, and leading indicators for Canadian exporters are deteriorating. Signs are also emerging that the nation\u2019s red-hot labor market is cooling off.Royal Bank of Canada expects Poloz to cut rates in the first quarter of next year, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce moving their call ahead to that same period earlier this week. Capital Economics, meanwhile, expects the central bank to lower its benchmark to 1 per cent by the end of 2020.Yet, there are plenty of arguments in favour of a hold. Canada\u2019s economy in the second quarter probably grew at a faster pace than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank\u2019s target.Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, sees another good reason for Poloz and his colleagues to buck the global easing trend. \u201cDo they want to go back to 2015 where they cut rates and stoked a big acceleration in credit and home prices? That\u2019s pretty fresh in their minds,\u201d Kavcic said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they want to go there right now.\u201dA re-acceleration in housing activity in many Canadian cities and some of the strongest wage growth in a decade, even as headline employment slows down, also has the potential to underpin consumption in the second half.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Rich, aging baby boomers will make it even harder for millennials to buy homes over next 10 years", "description": "A CMHC report says seniors in Toronto aren't downsizing like they used to", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/rich-aging-baby-boomers-will-make-it-even-harder-for-millennials-to-buy-homes-over-next-10-years", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/toronto-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 8, 2019 11:09 AM EDT", "content": "A growing cohort of rich, aging baby boomers will contribute to even tighter housing supply for younger generations in Toronto over the next decade, according to a new report.Seniors have traditionally downsized or switched to rentals and retirement homes, which has freed up supply for younger homeowners.

It\u2019s unclear how much opposition even a quarter-point cut will face within the FOMC, or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing.Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U.S. economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond.\u201cFor a lot of them, 25 will feel like a down payment,\u201d said William English, a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time.\u201d\u201cUncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well-telegraphed rate cut looming at present. Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing.\u201d\u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg economistsBefore Williams spoke on July 18, investors were pricing in a quarter-point cut. Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation. Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a \u201crisk management\u201d approach.In his remarks, Williams reviewed his long-standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero. Investors took it as a signal that a half-point move might be on the table, until the New York Fed issued the clarification.That steer, combined with a solid \u2014 though not spectacular \u2014 report on second-quarter economic growth, reduced the chances of a half-point cut to \u201calmost zero,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago.The data showed the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.1 per cent, slower than the first quarter but above the 1.8 per cent expected by economists.Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all. That group includes two current FOMC voters, Kansas City\u2019s Esther George and Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren, so resistance could spur two dissents. The meeting\u2019s minutes will be released on Aug. 21, providing a fuller picture of any divide, and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime.Several economists expect the committee\u2019s post-meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter-point cut as early as September, without committing the Fed to such a move.\u201cThe intention is likely to do another 25, but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York.Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations. Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news. Since the Fed last met, the U.S. and China have returned to the trade negotiating table, and fresh U.S. employment and spending numbers have come in strong.\u201cThat\u2019s a tricky issue for him,\u201d said English. \u201cSince June, the data\u2019s been pretty good.\u201dHe may also get questions on whether the Fed would join the U.S. government in intervening to weaken the dollar to aid U.S. exports after Trump told reporters last week that he had not ruled it out.Financial markets will also watch for an early end to the runoff of securities from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. That process, scheduled to conclude at the end of September, modestly tightens policy by removing downward pressure on long-term bond yields.Economists were divided on whether officials will want to halt the runoffs when they cut interest rates. Few saw an immediate cessation as likely, but some said it would simplify communications about the direction of monetary policy.\u201cThe markets won\u2019t be affected either way, but it\u2019s a cleaner message\u201d if the Fed halts the runoffs, Coronado said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s jobs market stalls after monster gains in first half of year", "description": "Decline comes after two months of gains", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/update-1-canada-economy-sheds-2200-jobs-in-june-after-two-months-of-gains", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/service-canada.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 5, 2019 11:08 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s booming labour market geared down in June, with employment little changed and a slight uptick in the jobless rate from historical lows.The economy shed 2,200 jobs on the month, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus economist expectations for a gain of about 10,000. The unemployment rate rose to 5.5 per cent, after reaching a four-decade low of 5.4 per cent in May.Even with the stall, the first half of the year was one of the best on record in terms of Canadian job gains.The flat reading for employment in June doesn\u2019t alter the picture of a labour market that remains the main driver of Canada\u2019s expansion, with most economists widely expecting a slowdown from its recent unsustainable pace. The economy has added 247,500 jobs since the end of last year \u2014 the bulk of them full-time \u2014 which is the strongest since 2002 and the second-best first-half employment gain in four decades.There were a number of pockets of strength in the report. Full-time jobs were up by 24,100, offsetting a decline in part-time employment. Self-employment fell, with the number of \u201cemployees\u201d increasing.Wage gains accelerated to the fastest in more than a year.The fact the labor market hasn\u2019t pulled back should bolster confidence in the sustainability of the current economic rebound and ease pressure on the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates, even if other central banks ease policy.The Canadian dollar fell after the report, which coincided the release of U.S. payroll data that topped all estimates of economists. As of 8:34 a.m. in Toronto trading, the dollar was down 0.3 per cent to 76.37 US cents. Yields on Canadian two-year bonds were up however, reflecting easing worries about rate cuts.\u201cWe\u2019ll forgive Canada\u2019s job market for taking an early summer holiday in terms of employment gains, given the massive surge in hiring that preceded it,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note.The one area of weakness seems to be the goods sector, which saw employment contract 32,800 in June. Half of that came from manufacturers. Employment in goods-producing industries is down by 9,400 in the first six months of 2019.Wages, however, are showing signs of strength. Annual hourly wages gains accelerated to 3.8 per cent in June, the fastest since May last year and up from 2.8 per cent in May. Pay gains for permanent workers climbed 3.6 per cent, also a sharp increase. The year-over- year acceleration largely reflects weakness this time last year.Total hours worked accelerated to 1.8 per cent from 1 per cent in May, the most since last fall.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Carolynn Look", "title": "The world of monetary policy, according to Christine Lagarde", "description": "Her views on central-banking issues fall in line with the ECB's \u2014 that is, with at least one exception", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-world-of-monetary-policy-according-to-christine-lagarde", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/aafp_1i98bb.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 3, 2019 12:01 PM EDT", "content": "Governments hoping their nominee for European Central Bank president will keep a steady hand on euro-zone monetary policy can probably take heart from Christine Lagarde\u2019s public views.Lagarde, a lawyer and former politician rather than an economist, has frequently commented on central-banking issues since becoming head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011. AsCentral guardian of the world\u2019s second-biggest currency area from Nov. 1, giving press conferences after each ECB policy meeting, her opinions will be key even if she leans on colleagues such as Philip Lane to craft detailed plans.For the European Union leaders who nominated her, a smooth transition from Mario Draghi is key \u2014 Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that \u201cwe have someone who gives guarantees that they won\u2019t constitute a rupture\u201d with the current president\u2019s strategy.Here is a selection of what Lagarde has said about the central bank\u2019s actions and challenges:Outright Monetary TransactionsDraghi\u2019s flagship tool for fighting the euro-zone debt crisis has never been used but it\u2019s still critical that the incoming chief backs it. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann\u2019s opposition to the bond-buying program known as OMT may have scuttled his own shot at the top job. Lagarde was in the audience when Draghi pledged in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, and spoke in favor of OMT after the program was announced weeks later.\u201cMany of the right decisions have been taken. Most recently, initiatives by major central banks \u2014 the European Central Bank\u2019s OMT bond-purchasing program, QE3 by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan\u2019s expanded Asset Purchase Program \u2014 are big policy signals in the right direction.\u201d \u2014 Sept. 24, 2012, Washington DCNegative Interest RatesShortly after the BOJ followed the ECB in adopting a negative interest rate in 2016, Lagarde praised the tool while saying more time is needed to assess its side effects. That\u2019s an issue on the Governing Council\u2019s agenda now as officials consider whether to cut rates further and keep them below zero for longer.While banks complain that negative rates \u2014 effectively a charge on their overnight reserves \u2014 hurt profitability, the ECB says that\u2019s outweighed by the boost to the economy. Lagarde thought so as well.\u201cIf we had not had those negative rates, we would be in a much worse place today, with inflation probably lower than where it is, with growth probably lower than where we have it.\u201d \u2014 March 18, 2016, Ho Chi Minh CityQuantitative EasingDraghi had to fight hard against skeptics both outside and within the ECB\u2019s Governing Council to launch his broad-based asset-purchase program. He finally announced it in January 2015, as the euro zone was teetering on the edge of deflation. Lagarde responded the same day.\u201cWe welcome the measures announced today that will strongly reinforce the ECB\u2019s accommodative stance. The planned expansion of the ECB\u2019s balance sheet will help lower borrowing cost across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation.\u201d \u2014 Jan. 22, 2015, IMF statementFiscal SupportLagarde has demonstrated realism when it comes to central banks\u2019 ability to counter the next downturn, backing the ECB\u2019s repeated calls for governments to offer more support with better fiscal policies. She has urged nations to strike a better balance between growth, debt sustainability and social objectives.\u201cMonetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, and should anchor expectations\u2026. The reality is that many economies are not resilient enough. High public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will. For many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d \u2014 April 2, 2019, WashingtonEuropean ReformsDraghi and his colleagues have also spent years urging governments to pursue structural reforms to bolster their economies, cries that have intensified as populist movements challenge European cohesion. Lagarde is on board with that as well, advocating flexible hiring practices, modernizing and harmonizing insolvency regimes, and spending more on innovation.\u201cOur goal should be clear: Restarting convergence and ensuring the fruits of economic growth are shared broadly across the EU. This will help restore faith in the European project.\u201d \u2014 Feb. 14, 2019, MunichFresh StimulusThe ECB and the Federal Reserve are expected to ease their monetary stances as soon as this summer in response to a global economic slowdown amid risks including U.S.-driven trade protectionism and Brexit. For that strategy, Lagarde has delivered praise, while again reminding governments that central bankers can\u2019t do it alone.\u201cThese policy responses have provided vital support over the past few months.\u2026 When the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will, policy makers may need to use all policy tools to maximize their combined effect. This means supporting demand through decisive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus wherever possible.\u201d \u2014 June 5, 2019, IMF blogRadical TheoryFinally, Lagarde has dipped into a topic that tends to make central bankers shudder \u2014 Modern Monetary Theory. Typically advocated as an argument for governments to worry less about budget deficits and use fiscal firepower to achieve full employment, monetary officials see it as poison to their independence. While Lagarde said MMT is no panacea, she didn\u2019t reject it outright.\u201cWhile it is tempting, when you look at the sort of mathematical modelling of it, and it seems to stand, there are big caveats about it, such as if the country is in a liquidity trap, such as if there is deflation. Well then, in those circumstances, it could possibly work for a short period of time probably, because interest rates stay low until such time when they start going up. And then it is a bit of a trap.\u201d \u2014 April 11, 2019, IMF press conferenceBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Simon Kennedy", "title": "Christine Lagarde to succeed Mario Draghi as ECB chief just as economy weakens", "description": "Lagarde becomes the first woman to run euro-area monetary policy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/christine-lagarde-to-succeed-mario-draghi-as-ecb-chief-amid-weakening-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/christine-lagarde.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 2, 2019 2:28 PM EDT", "content": "Christine Lagarde is set to swap the helm of the International Monetary Fund for that of the European Central Bank, becoming the first woman to run euro-area monetary policy just as the bloc\u2019s economy looks in need of fresh stimulus.Lagarde was nominated to succeed Mario Draghi as president of the ECB when his eight-year term ends on Oct. 31. European governments turned to the 63-year old onetime lawyer and former French finance minister on Tuesday after hours of negotiations over a package of top EU jobs.In moving from Washington to Frankfurt, Lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19-nation economy which Draghi has already signalled will need more help, likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing. Inflation is running at barely half the ECB\u2019s goal of just under 2 per cent despite years of negative rates and 2.6 trillion euros (US$3 trillion) of bond purchases.Investors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis-fighter, Lagarde will share Draghi\u2019s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy, especially as her appointment means the more hawkish Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann misses out. Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Morgan Stanley said the choice of Lagarde increases their \u201cconviction\u201d that the ECB will eventually resume buying bonds.Lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a \u201crough patch\u201d and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response. In June 2014, she said she would \u201ccertainly hope\u201d the ECB would conduct QE if inflation stayed sluggish \u2014 months before it announced it would do so.She also praised Draghi\u2019s 2012 commitment to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns. In March, she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright Moliere: \u201cThe trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.\u201dJust last September, Lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ECB, telling the Financial Times she was a \u201d bit annoyed and fed up\u201d with the suggestion and that she was \u201cnot interested\u201d in the role. Only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job, with Weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a tight race dominated by men.France has now twice secured the presidency of the two-decade-old ECB. Draghi, an Italian, was preceded by Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, who replaced Dutchman Wim Duisenberg.In common with Trichet, whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of Credit Lyonnais, Lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles. They culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi-million euro dispute linked to the same bank.Lagarde\u2019s appointment also means the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve will be headed by former lawyers, a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as Ben Bernanke. That risks opening her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy.\u201cShe\u2019s very political, she\u2019s very wise, and I would assume she has the best economists that can help her with this,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment. \u201cIt is a little puzzling because she\u2019s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there.\u201dShe does boast political nous though, which will be needed to unite fellow ECB officials when setting policy \u2014 especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy.\u201cShe has the political skills needed to build consensus on the Governing Council, is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ECB\u2019s decisions on the larger European stage \u2014 though she may still face skepticism in Germany,\u201d said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \u201cShe would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space.\u201dEU Council President Donald Tusk dismissed concerns about Lagarde\u2019s lack of formal economic training. She will make a \u201cperfect\u201d ECB president, he said in Brussels.Alongside Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Lagarde will be one of two women on the six-member Executive Board. They are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25-member Governing Council, which includes the governors of euro-region national central banks and has long been dominated by men.Lagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the IMF, being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016. She will now leave more than 1 1/2 years before that is due to end, likely sparking a fight between capitals over whether a European should always run the lender or if it\u2019s time for an emerging-market candidate to do so.At the IMF, Lagarde helped negotiate the fund\u2019s biggest ever bailout when it handed fresh aid last year to Argentina. She also sought to give emerging economies such as China more of a voice in its management, while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality. That helped broaden the fund\u2019s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts.She sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set. As the leader of one of Greece\u2019s major creditors, she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro-zone while at the same time persuading its European partners to allow debt relief. In 2018, she and Weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon Germany\u2019s government to spend more and close its current account surplus.Lagarde was educated in France and the U.S., working as an intern in the U.S. Congress for a time. On graduating from the University of Paris, Nanterre, she joined the Paris office of Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. She focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions, rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999.Then-French President Jacques Chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade. She went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a Group of Seven economy in June 2007.She held that role as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro-area debt crisis. During the all-night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing M&M\u2019s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs.\u201cIf it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today,\u201d she once said.A past member of France\u2019s synchronized swimming team, Lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to \u201cgrit your teeth and smile.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ellen Huet", "title": "Gig-economy workers beware: Know what you're cashing when you get a surprise cheque", "description": "Some U.S. companies are sending cheques to contract workers, who, by cashing them, may be unknowingly waiving their rights", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/gig-economy-workers-beware-know-what-youre-cashing-when-you-get-a-surprise-cheque", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/a0508_biz_wire_lyft.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 2, 2019 2:20 PM EDT", "content": "The perennial issue in the gig economy is whether workers should be classified as employees. Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and other U.S. companies that rely on contract work have dealt with this question in a number of ways: staging PR campaigns, hiring lobbyists and arguing in court that they\u2019re software platforms, not employers. At Getaround Inc., which helps people rent out their personal cars online, the startup is employing an uncommon legal tactic in the hope of defeating a class-action lawsuit before it starts.As lawyers were working on one such case, Getaround preemptively sent dozens of cheques to people who have worked with the company, attached to paperwork asking them to sign away their legal rights. According to a provision within the documents, depositing the money, even without signing the contract, would count as an agreement to waive their rights to sue. And almost everyone did.The technique, which has been used selectively by companies in other industries,\u00a0may prove to be particularly effective in the gig economy, where workers lack financial stability,\u00a0said Bryan Schwartz, a Bay Area\u00a0attorney who\u2019s not involved in the case. It\u2019s an \u201cinsidious\u201d move, he said, because recipients likely can\u2019t afford to seek legal counsel and weigh the benefits of holding out for a potentially larger payout from a lawsuit.\u00a0\u201cLow-wage workers, who are trying to make ends meet, are especially vulnerable,\u201d said Schwartz, who serves on the board of the California Employment Lawyers Association, a worker advocacy\u00a0group. \u201cThey\u2019re going to sign and take the pittance to waive all their claims.\u201dGetaround\u2019s legal strategy in this case, which involves whether contract workers should be treated as regular employees,\u00a0highlights\u00a0the creative measures gig companies will take to avoid scrutiny of their use of contractors. Many of these businesses are unprofitable and would lose even more money if they were forced to reclassify workers and pay employment benefits. In California, where Getaround and its ilk are based, companies are reeling from last year\u2019s sweeping ruling by the state\u2019s supreme court\u00a0that limits the scope of work companies can classify as contracted. Lyft, Uber and Postmates Inc.\u00a0have been lobbying lawmakers\u00a0and publishing op-eds,\u00a0hoping to find a workaround. And all\u00a0these companies have faced lawsuits from contractors\u00a0claiming they should get the same benefits and protections as employees.A spokeswoman for Getaround said the company denies the allegations in the suit and will continue to defend itself. She wrote in an email that Getaround has a commitment to\u00a0\u201cfairly value the contributions of our employees.\u201dThe legal gambit is known among employment lawyers as \u201cPick Up Stix.\u201d The name is a reference to a 2009 case involving a fast-casual restaurant chain that used the strategy to secure settlements with workers seeking overtime pay. Recipients may not realize that accepting the cheque means they\u2019re giving up a chance at a bigger payout down the line \u2014 or they may not be able to afford to wait.Last year, a former Getaround worker, Amanda Ponciano, sued the company, saying her work as a \u201cfleet associate\u201d qualified as that of an employee but she was paid like a contractor. She and other fleet associates were paid around US$15 an hour to move cars around the city and help prep vehicles to be rented. She said they went through a two-week training program administered by Getaround, were assigned shifts by the company, wore Getaround hats and jackets and used mostly company-provided equipment \u2014 details that she said support her misclassification claim.In October, while her attorney worked to get class-action certification for the suit, Getaround sent out letters and emails to the 61 people in California who had worked the same job as Ponciano in recent years. In the envelope was a cheque and a message saying the money is theirs if they sign a settlement waiving their right to sue Getaround for anything that happened in the past. It also said they could simply deposit the cheque to indicate their consent. All but four took the offer.The cheques ranged from US$250 to about US$9,000, depending on how long the person had worked for Getaround, said Ramsey Hanafi, the attorney working on the suit. The company spent about US$145,000 on this initial round of settlements, according to a legal filing. Around the same time, Getaround made its fleet associates employees. The company declined to explain its reasoning for the change.Low-wage workers, who are trying to make ends meet, are especially vulnerable. They're going to sign and take the pittance to waive all their claims.Then, in May, Getaround sent a new settlement offer. It needed to amend its previous contracts because it had actually asked its fleet associates to sign away more rights than was legally tenable. (Though, in general, collecting preemptive settlements is considered a viable strategy.) In the new letter, Getaround told the workers that they could either sign the new agreement and get an additional US$100 cheque mailed to them, or they could return the money they had previously accepted in the first agreement, Hanafi said. If they did neither, Getaround wrote in the emails, the company could sue them for the money.The most recent settlements were due in June. The case, which is ongoing, has yet to achieve class-action status. Its next court date is in August. Hanafi estimated Getaround owes US$1.6 million for wages and penalties, far more than the company will pay in settlements. His client, Ponciano, doesn\u2019t fault her former colleagues for taking the cash from Getaround. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised when Getaround said, \u2018Hey, take this money,\u2019 and they all said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Ponciano said. \u201cA lot of the people I worked with were really pressed for money.\u201dGetaround, on the other hand, isn\u2019t hurting for cash. SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Vision Fund led a US$300 million investment in the company last year. Getaround has been on a spending spree since then. It bought Drivy, which operates a car-sharing service in Europe, for US$300 million in April, and Nabobil, a similar business in Norway, for US$12 million last week.Settling worker claims the way Getaround did is unusual among gig-economy companies but only because most of them\u00a0already require\u00a0workers to sign class-action waivers\u00a0as part of their arbitration agreements, said\u00a0Christian Schreiber, an attorney who has handled worker misclassification cases against Lyft.\u00a0Getaround declined to specify whether it has asked workers to sign arbitration agreements.The ease with which these companies can communicate with workers en masse through an app means they can easily change the rules at any time,\u00a0Schreiber said.

It emerged from bankruptcy just 10 months prior to two fires in June that closed down key gasoline-making units just as the summer driving season gears up.Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Wednesday the refinery will close within the next month. The complex produces 335,000 barrels a day, meeting about 3 per cent of gasoline demand in a densely populated region. Futures in New York jumped more than 5 per cent on a Reuters report Tuesday night that the refinery would close.PES will lay off half of its 640 union workers and 130 salaried employees Wednesday, said a person familiar with the plans.On Monday, the United Steelworkers union said any decision to shut the complex would have lasting consequences \u201cstarting with almost 2,000 workers directly employed by PES and tens of thousands more whose employment depends on the refinery to some degree,\u201d according to a statement by USW International Vice President Tom Conway.PES officials will meet with Ryan O\u2019Callaghan, president of USW Local 10-1 at noon local time, he said in an interview Wednesday. O\u2019Callaghan, who represents 640 USW workers at the refinery, said he hadn\u2019t been given prior warning of any plans to close.The refinery was beset by two fires, on June 10 and June 21. The most recent, affecting an alkylation unit used to make high-octane gasoline, was triggered by an explosion in the complex\u2019s Girard Point section that could be seen miles away and was picked up by weather satellites. The earlier blaze was at a fluid catalytic cracker in the Point Breeze section of the refinery.The plant is the biggest of five refineries in the Northeast. It\u2019s faced threats before. In 2012, with supply outpacing demand, it took a change of ownership and a push by lawmakers and unions to keep it operating.\u201cThat refinery plays a huge part in the gasoline market,\u201d said Gene McGillian, vice president at Tradition Energy, a risk management firm in Stamford, Conn.The loss of the refinery will likely increase the region\u2019s dependence on supplies from Canada, Europe and the Gulf Coast, potentially boosting prices for drivers and profit margins for the remaining plants in the area. Shares of PBF Energy Inc, which operates two refineries near Philadelphia, have surged 14 per cent since Thursday.\u201cThe U.S. Gulf Coast will remain a key supplier of refined products with supplemental gasoline imports from Europe likely needed to replenish lost production from the facility,\u201d Marc Amons, senior research analyst, North America refining at Wood Mackenzie, said in an emailed statement.In 2012, the Philadelphia facility almost closed before being taken over by Energy Transfer Partners subsidiary Sunoco Inc. and the Carlyle Group. It emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August with the previous owners retaining smaller stakes.The fundamental problems that undercut the complex in 2012, though, largely remained.East Coast refiners aren\u2019t on the receiving end of crude pipelines from America\u2019s oil shale riches in Texas and North Dakota. So the only way they can get hold of U.S. crude is by train or U.S.-flagged tankers, which are much more expensive. The result: Philadelphia-area fuel makers still import crude from West Africa and the North Sea.PES used to take at least 200 rail cars a day of Bakken crude, but most of those barrels were diverted to the Midwest and Gulf Coast after pipeline expansions. Margins for processing imported crude sank in early June to the lowest in three years, according to Oil Analytics data. At the same time, refiners in the Midwest were threatening to encroach on part of the nearby western Pennsylvania market.Girard Point was already facing months of downtime as inspections continue to determine extent of damage from Friday\u2019s explosions and fire.To permanently shut both Girard Point and the Point Breeze section \u201ccould take up to a year to fully secure the facility and removes the crude and products that remain in the process units and the storage tanks,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boesler and Rich Miller", "title": "Fed's Powell reiterates case for interest rate cuts amid increased economic risks", "description": "The Fed chairman also highlighted the importance of the central bank's autonomy from political interference, but didn't mention Trump by name", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/feds-powell-reiterates-case-for-interest-rate-cuts-amid-increased-economic-risks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jerome-powell-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 25, 2019 2:22 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have increased recently, reinforcing the case among policy makers for somewhat lower interest rates.\u201cCrosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy,\u201d Powell said Tuesday in the text of remarks to be delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.His comments echoed those he made last week following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Powell said before answering questions at the event that he intended Tuesday\u2019s remarks to be fully consistent with what he said last week.\u201cMany FOMC participants judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,\u201d he added.Stocks in the U.S. bounced off lows after Powell\u2019s comments. Treasury 10-year yields fell back below 2 per cent.A consensus is building that Powell and his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will cut interest rates in coming months, as trade disputes hurt the outlook for the world economy. That\u2019s what investors and analysts now expect \u2014 and what President Donald Trump is loudly demanding.Powell did not mention Trump by name in his opening remarks to the council. But he did highlight the importance of the central bank\u2019s autonomy from political interference.\u201cThe Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures \u2014 what is often referred to as our independence,\u201d Powell said. \u201cCongress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests.\u201dTrump has criticized the central bank for keeping credit too costly and for failing to lower interest rates last week. Policy makers \u201cblew it\u201d on June 19 when they kept the benchmark overnight rate unchanged at just under 2.5 per cent, Trump tweeted on Monday. He compared the Fed to a \u201cstubborn child.\u201dSome of those policy makers did in fact advocate for a rate cut at last week\u2019s meeting, including St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard and the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s Neel Kashkari. They were driven by concern that inflation is stuck below the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target \u2014 suggesting that there\u2019s room to stimulate the economy, helping to create more jobs and boost wages, without pushing prices too high.The U.S. economy is slowing after a stronger than expected first quarter. Sales of new U.S. homes fell to a five-month low in May while consumer confidence dropped in June to its lowest level since September 2017, according to reports Tuesday.\u201cThe limited available evidence we have suggests that investment by businesses has slowed from the pace earlier in the year,\u201d Powell said.The Fed chairman said the economic outlook basically remained promising, with unemployment near historic lows.\u201cHowever, the risks to this favourable baseline outlook appear to have grown,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed scraps its 'patient' interest rate approach in prelude to potential cut", "description": "Federal Reserve indicated a readiness to lower interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, citing 'uncertainties' in the outlook", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-signals-possible-cuts-later-this-year?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 19, 2019 3:36 PM EDT", "content": "The Federal Reserve indicated a readiness to lower interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, citing \u201cuncertainties\u201d in the outlook that have increased the case for a cut as officials seek to prolong the near-record U.S. economic expansion.While Chairman Jerome Powell and fellow policy makers left their key rate in a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent on Wednesday, they dropped a reference in their statement to being \u201cpatient\u201d on borrowing costs and forecast a larger miss of their 2 per cent inflation target this year. Powell has been repeatedly pressured by President Donald Trump to juice the economy by cutting rates.\u201cMy colleagues and I have one overarching goal, to sustain the economic expansion,\u201d Powell told a press conference following the decision, noting that many policy makers see a strengthened case for a cut.U.S. stocks rose after the decision and Treasuries erased losses. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell to 2.03 per cent. Fed funds futures priced in increased odds of a rate cut at the July meeting.The change in tone follows attacks on the Fed by Trump for not doing more to bolster the economy and Tuesday\u2019s report by Bloomberg News that the president asked White House lawyers earlier this year to explore his options for demoting Powell from the chairmanship.Powell, responding to a reporter\u2019s question, said he thinks \u201cthe law is clear that I have a four-year term and I fully intend to serve it.\u201dHe declined to comment directly on the president\u2019s public criticism of the central bank, but said the Fed is \u201cdeeply committed to carrying out our mission\u201d and that its independence from politics is an \u201cimportant institutional feature that has served the economy and the country well.\u201dThe Fed still expects a strong labour market and inflation to be near its goal but \u201cuncertainties about this outlook have increased,\u2019\u2019 the Federal Open Market Committee said in the statement following a two-day meeting in Washington. \u201cIn light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201dThe FOMC vote was not unanimous, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard seeking a quarter-point rate cut. His vote marked the first dissent of Powell\u2019s 16-month tenure as chairman.Policy makers were starkly divided on the path for policy. Eight of 17 penciled in a reduction by the end of the year as another eight saw no change and one forecast a hike, according to updated quarterly forecasts.In the statement, officials downgraded their assessment of economic activity to a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace from \u201csolid\u201d at their last gathering.The pivot toward easier monetary policy shows the Fed swinging closer to the view of most investors that Trump\u2019s trade war is slowing the economy\u2019s momentum and that rates are too restrictive given sluggish inflation.Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed risk casting a political shadow over whatever policy decision the Fed makes, though Powell and his colleagues say they\u2019re focusing only on the economic goals Congress gave them.Officials noted that \u201cgrowth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year\u201d and that indicators of business fixed investment \u201chave been soft.\u201d They repeated that the labour market \u201cremains strong.\u201dInvestors have been betting the Fed will reduce rates at its next meeting in late July, though a majority of economists surveyed earlier this month don\u2019t expect a move until December.Recent U.S. economic data have been mixed. Consumer spending held up in May but job gains were disappointing, and some gauges of business sentiment have cooled on uncertainty around the outlook for trade. The Fed remains bedevilled by inflation continuing to undershoot the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target despite unemployment being at a 49-year low.\u201cBloomberg Economics retains the view that if economic data firm somewhat and trade tensions cool, the Fed may avoid embarking on insurance cuts \u2014 or at the very least will deliver far less accommodation than what markets have started to price in.\u201d \u2013Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Eliza WingerCentral bankers are likely hoping for greater clarity over Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Stocks jumped on Tuesday after the president said he would meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping at next week\u2019s Group of 20 summit in Japan.The Fed, which raised interest rates four times last year and as recently as December projected further hikes in 2019, isn\u2019t alone in changing tack.

The Taiwanese contract manufacturer now makes most of the smartphones in the Chinese mainland.China is a crucial cog in Apple\u2019s business, the origin of most of its iPhones and iPads as well as its largest international market. But President Donald Trump has threatened Beijing with new tariffs on about US$300 billion worth of Chinese goods, an act that would escalate tensions dramatically while levying a punitive tax on Apple\u2019s most profitable product.Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, is the American giant\u2019s most important manufacturing partner.

Aside from the renovation cost, the building sat vacant for almost a year. But those were risks the company had to take to cope with a market that\u2019s been gutted by an exodus of oil-industry jobs.\u201cWe\u2019d still be losing money if they\u2019d stayed,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Riaz Mamdani said in an interview in a new apartment in the building, which has been re-branded as Cube. \u201cThe cost of keeping them in this building was greater than the value of the building. That just made no economic sense.\u201dDevelopers in Canada\u2019s oil capital are converting workplaces to homes as office vacancies hover near record highs after an exodus of international producers and industry-wide job cuts. Following the 2014-2016 price crash, companies are grappling with a pipeline shortage that discourages growth. Encana Corp., Cenovus Energy Inc. and MEG Energy Corp. are among producers that have cut jobs in the past two years even as global crude prices rebounded.The conversion trend is also taking root in Alberta\u2019s capital of Edmonton, where new office towers have left older buildings without tenants, as well as in other cities where residents are eager to move downtown.But nowhere are conversions as needed as in Calgary. Since 2016, more than 20 per cent of the city\u2019s downtown office space has been available for rent, according to commercial real estate analysis firm CoStar Group. That\u2019s roughly five times the rate in Toronto and Vancouver, and about twice as much as Edmonton. By contrast, Calgary\u2019s residential vacancy rate is 4.1 per cent.The cost of keeping them in this building was greater than the value of the buildingEmpty office towers were unthinkable just five years ago, when the city long accustomed to being one of Canada\u2019s richest was teeming with executives and workers from around the globe.\u201cThis was the land of 1 per cent vacancies when times were good,\u201d said Roelof van Dijk, director of Canada market analytics at CoStar. Now, \u201cLandlords are looking at ways to get around the high vacancy and figure out income streams.\u201dThe city, suffering from declining property-tax revenue, is also doing its part. While inter-provincial trade agreements prevent cities in Alberta from offering tax incentives to lure corporate offices, city-funded Calgary Economic Development is on a full-court press to try to woo new businesses.The group, with hundreds of active files mostly for companies with 50 to 60 employees, recently managed to draw BASF SE\u2019s Canadian headquarters and its 60 workers to Calgary, away from Mississauga, Ontario. It also runs the Startup Calgary initiative to help entrepreneurs get businesses off the ground and manages a fund that invests in innovative projects.But to undo the damage from the oil downturn, the city will need to attract major companies, and that will be its focus in the coming years, Calgary Economic Development CEO Mary Moran said.\u201cWe have to deal with it like it\u2019s a 10-to-15 year issue and have long-term commitments to the solutions,\u201d she said.That time horizon accords with Mamdani\u2019s forecast that the city will need 12 to 16 years to absorb all of its vacant office space. With that in mind, he has embarked on other office-to-residential projects. The firm is turning the Barron Building, a historic office tower built in 1951 as the city went through its first oil boom, into 94 apartments for more than $100 million. The edifice is scheduled to open to residents in 2020.In Edmonton, Strategic Group is investing $54.5 million to turn an office tower into 177 apartments in what it\u2019s calling the e11even, and $57 million to convert another building called Capital into 154 suites.Other developers have embarked on similar projects. In Edmonton, the former Enbridge Tower, which has a peaked roof that makes it one of the city\u2019s most recognizable buildings, was converted to a 300-room hotel by Lighthouse Hospitality for about $70 million.The strategy has its limits, though. Office towers with large floor plans can\u2019t be converted because the apartments, which need to stretch from the building\u2019s exterior to the interior elevator corridor, would be impractically long. Also, the vacant offices are signs of struggling job markets, which limit residential demand. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 7 per cent in May, compared with a 5.4 per cent national average.But Mamdani, 51, is confident in Calgary\u2019s future. The city already has reduced its reliance on the boom-and-bust oil industry to about a third of its economy from roughly half in the 1990s. And even through the oil sector\u2019s peaks and troughs, residential demand has grown, helped by international immigration and a relatively young population.It\u2019s those younger professionals that the Cube is aimed toward, Mamdani says. The apartments, which start at around $1,300 per month, feature white quartz countertops, floor-to-ceiling windows, built-in safes, high ceilings and stainless steel appliances, along with wall USB charging ports and a rooftop firepit with mountain views.Mamdani says those amenities and the apartments\u2019 newness \u2014 about two-thirds of the city\u2019s apartments are at least 40 years old \u2014 have helped residents overlook the quirks left over from the building\u2019s previous life as an office tower, including some inconveniently placed pillars, along with a few awkward hallways and unconventional floor plans. The building is already about half full even though some construction, mostly on the building\u2019s exterior, has yet to be completed.Mamdani is encouraged by those results, especially since Alberta Health Services didn\u2019t vacate the premises until the end of August, meaning the whole turnaround has taken less than a year.

The currency jumped on the report, which is seen to give the central bank more ammunition to resist pressure to lower borrowing costs.The Canadian jobs report contrasts with weaker-than-expected payroll data in the U.S. that\u2019s fuelling concern of a broader slowdown there and boosting calls for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.Canada\u2019s report \u201cwas a good number with strong details, in contrast with pretty soft numbers in the U.S.,\u201d Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank, said by phone from Toronto.\u201cThis suggests greater capacity for the Bank of Canada to stay on hold if the Fed does cut rates.\u201d Economists forecast Canadian employment to rise by 5,000, after a record gain of 106,500 in April. Canada\u2019s currency jumped 0.6 per cent to 75.30 US cents at 11:13 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on government 2-year bonds held steady at 1.38 per cent. The spread against U.S. Treasuries of equivalent maturity narrowed to 43 basis points, the tightest in more than a year.In Canada, all indications point to an economy growing at a much faster pace than it had in the final three months of last year and the beginning of 2019. Along with the jobs report, recent data show a strong rebound in output in March, signs of stabilization in housing and improving export numbers. Economists anticipate growth will accelerate to more than 2 per cent on an annualized basis in the second quarter.Canadian employment is now up 2.4 per cent from the same period in 2018, the largest year-over-year increase since before the 2008-2009 recession. The number of people unemployed is also the lowest in a decade. Over the past two years, Canada\u2019s economy has added almost 700,000 new jobs.Three provinces relatively immune from the recent weakness in the oil sector \u2014 Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec \u2014 are mostly responsible for the growth in employment, as are service-related industries such as transportation, technology and professionals.Companies that have been hiring include Staples Canada, Canada Goose Holdings, Accenture, along with a surge in employment by technology companies.\u201cOne of the things that I suspect is happening there is that global technology companies that are by and large US-based, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons, etc., are hiring workers to a greater extent in this geography relative to the U.S.,\u201d Neil Selfe, a founding partner at Infor Financial Group, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. That\u2019s \u201cbecause of the visa issues and the immigration issues of the Trump administration.\u201dCanada has been able to produce strong job gains over the past two years largely because of a rapid increase in the labour force, on higher immigration and youth participation. The bigger risk in Canada is the labour force growth won\u2019t be sustained and the market could tighten. For example, the labour force dropped by 49,200 in May, one of the largest one-month declines, after surging in recent months.As a result, rising demand for workers was met by tapping into the unemployed ranks. The number of people looking for work and unable to find it dropped by 76,900 in May, the biggest one-month decline since 1993.Another sign of tightening is that the recent acceleration in wage growth is holding. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.8 per cent in May, from 2.5 per cent in April, bringing it to the fastest since August last year. Pay gains for permanent employees were steady at 2.6 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "The same type of debt blamed in the U.S. credit crisis could help Canada with housing risk", "description": "Mortgage backed securities would be a good way for lenders to hedge their residential real estate exposure", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/the-same-type-of-debt-blamed-in-the-u-s-credit-crisis-could-help-canada-with-housing-risk", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 5, 2019 12:15 PM EDT", "content": "The type of securities blamed for triggering a credit crisis in the U.S. a decade ago could now be part of the solution in Canada, where a cooling housing market is a key risk to its $1.7 trillion economy.The Bank of Canada is discussing ways to encourage a more robust market for residential mortgage-backed securities with potential investors. Only about $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) of Canadian uninsured mortgages have been pooled in RMBS deals, or about 0.1 per cent of the country\u2019s mortgage debt, according to rating company DBRS Ltd. No lender has widely marketed such a deal since September, when private lender MCAP sold $254 million of the notes.While previous efforts to kick-start an RMBS market have borne little fruit, this time may be different as Canadian home prices are rising at the slowest pace this decade amid higher interest rates, regulatory changes and tax increases designed to reign in surging prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver.\u201cWhile lenders are very well equipped to manage normal market risks, I suspect they are rather unwilling to take on the additional risk of future government intervention in the housing markets,\u201d said Andrey Pavlov, a professor of finance at Beedie School of Business of Simon Fraser University in Greater Vancouver. \u201cTherefore, lenders are likely more interested today than they have ever been in hedging their residential real estate exposure, and mortgage backed securities would be a good way to do so.\u201dLenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and returns \u2014 too much risk it turned out during the U.S. financial crisis when shady loans made it into MBS tranches. There\u2019s been little evidence risky mortgages have become a feature in Canada. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property.On top of raising funds, the sellers of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital they have to set aside to cover eventual losses should they meet certain conditions, including selling significant portions of the lower rated, higher risk bond tranches.The notes are repaid as borrowers pay down debt. The legal duration of the bonds could be significantly longer than the expected repayment rate suggests. This could be a useful tool for lenders to offer longer-term mortgages in a country where most of the home loans have a 5-year term. The repayment of the bonds can be adapted to the repayment of the underlying collateral.Up until 2016, Canadian lenders relied heavily on Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., the country\u2019s national housing agency to insure mortgages with down payments of less than 20 per cent and then packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities to fund obligations. But as part of its efforts to curb taxpayer exposure to the housing market, the government made it more difficult to get insurance. The market for uninsured mortgages took off \u2014 MBS based on the debt less so.\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing education job around investors just to highlight the difference between that product and the CMHC product, and we are investing in that so that the market grows over time,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an interview last week. The RMBS \u201cmarket is not nearly as developed as the CMHC mortgage bond market is. I would say our hope is over time that market will grow, and the banks generally I believe are interested in issuing that product.\u201dThe Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of participants in the bond market, has been working since at least last year to analyze the conditions and incentives that would be required to expand interest in the asset class, according to the minutes of their meetings. It conducted a focus group last month with mostly buy side institutions about the disclosure on the underlying collateral and other features they may require. The group, known as CFIF, was scheduled to discuss the issue again at a June 4 meeting.One way to bolster investors\u2019 confidence in deals would be by setting up a public database of mortgages used in securitization deals including anonymized details of the borrower, property and loan performance, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said last month. A similar project was supported by the European Central Bank in a bid to re-start sales of asset-backed securities after investors shunned hard-to-value assets following the seizure of the U.S. mortgage securitization market in 2007.\u201cA loan level data portal is a great idea,\u201d said Imran Chaudhry, a senior portfolio manager at Forresters Asset Management Inc., which manages about $8.5 billion of assets and has invested in Canadian securitizations. \u201cIssuing public RMBS deals would provide a larger investor base to the issuers and help establish a diversified funding source for them over a longer term.\u201dThe starting point of RMBS as a funding tool isn\u2019t the most attractive for banks as investors may demand an extra yield of 20 to 30 basis points over their senior bail-in debt in a stable market situation, said Chaudhry, who is part of the CFIF. Yet, once a market develops the spreads will tighten and it will make economic sense for the lenders to issue, he said.All these efforts are occurring at a time when the household debt-to-disposable income ratio in Canada at the end of 2018 hit a record high of 175 per cent, up from 136 per cent in 2006. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income ended last year at 98 per cent, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cA key domestic risk is a sharp correction in the housing market,\u201d officials at International Monetary Fund said in May 21 statement about the state of the Canadian economy. To be sure strong immigration, underlying strength in the economy and an unemployment rate near historic lows argues against such a scenario.Lenders\u2019 exposure to an eventual downturn may be increasing. According to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canadian bank regulator, the ratio of uninsured over insured mortgages has jumped to the highest since 1997.At the end of March, the volume of uninsured mortgages surged 14 per cent from a year ago, accounting for about 59 per cent of the $1.17 trillion of home loans at Canada\u2019s federally regulated banks, while insured home loans fell 7.8 per cent from a year ago, according to data from OSFI. On Tuesday, the regulator announced it was increasing a domestic stability buffer for systemically important banks to 2 per cent of their risk weighted assets from 1.75 per cent, effective Oct. 31, citing vulnerabilities that include household indebtedness.\u201cTo be clear, the system is not broken \u2014 it has served Canadians and financial institutions well,\u201d said Poloz in a May 6 speech in Winnipeg. \u201cWe should not stop looking for improvement.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg, Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boesler and Christopher Condon", "title": "Fed\u2019s Jerome Powell signals openness to cut rates if needed on trade tension", "description": "Second FOMC member to raise possibility", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/powell-signals-openness-to-cut-rates-if-needed-on-trade-tension", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jerome-powell-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2019 11:54 AM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signalled an openness to cut interest rates if necessary, pledging to keep a close watch on fallout from a deepening set of disputes between the U.S. and its largest trading partners.Referring to \u201ctrade negotiations and other matters,\u201d Powell said that \u201cwe do not know how or when these issues will be resolved,\u201d according to the text of a speech he\u2019s set to deliver Tuesday in Chicago.\u201cWe are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 per cent objective,\u201d Powell said in opening remarks at a conference at the Chicago Fed.Investors have aggressively increased bets the Fed will cut interest rates this year after President Donald Trump widened ongoing trade tensions when he threatened last week to slap new tariffs on Mexico unless it stemmed migrant flows to the U.S. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries Monday fell below 2.1 per cent, the lowest since September 2017.Powell\u2019s speech was dedicated mostly to the Fed\u2019s yearlong goal of reviewing its monetary policy strategies, tools and communication practices.\u201cWith the economy growing, unemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the public broadly on these topics,\u201d Powell said.The two-day research conference is the centerpiece of the review. Fed officials and leading academics are set to debate whether they need to make changes in order to shore up inflation expectations and improve their defences for the purposes of fighting the next economic downturn, whenever it comes.The conference, which was announced in November, is taking place amid heightened volatility in financial markets, owing to increasing concerns about Trump\u2019s threats to further restrict global trade. It also follows a string of government reports on consumer prices that have shown inflation drifting below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target so far this year, which many economists fear will limit policy makers\u2019 ability to stimulate the economy if necessary.In remarks earlier on Tuesday, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans brushed aside the idea the Fed needed to cut rates in response to market pressure. Evans votes on monetary policy this year.\u201cWith inflation being a little bit on the light side, there\u2019s the capacity to adjust policy if that\u2019s necessary, but the fundamentals for the economy continue to be solid,\u201d Evans told CNBC television. \u201cThe consumer is solid. I think we have to think through what this really means.\u201dSpeaking Monday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who also votes on the central bank\u2019s interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, became the first FOMC member to call for a rate cut, citing below-target inflation and the threat to economic growth posed by trade tensions.The FOMC next meets June 18-19 in Washington.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ranjeetha Pakiam and Justina Vasquez", "title": "Bullion, gold shares shine after Trump's Mexico tariff declaration", "description": "\u2018No country is safe\u2019 from being pulled into escalating trade war", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/bullion-gold-shares-shine-after-trumps-mexico-tariff-declaration", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/0818_biz_wire_gold.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 31, 2019 1:39 PM EDT", "content": "Gold is finally seeing some bullish momentum as trade ructions escalate, fuelling the biggest rally among the top miners in seven months.President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose a five per cent tariff on all Mexican goods in his fight against illegal immigration rattled financial markets, boosting the haven appeal of the metal that has been weighed down by the strong dollar.

That would mark a fifth straight hold by the central bank since it last raised borrowing costs in October. Longer-term, most analysts predict rates won\u2019t rise again until next year at the earliest.It\u2019s a reflection of an economy, only just emerging from a serious slowdown, that\u2019s still too fragile to cope with higher rates. Businesses are spooked by global trade uncertainty. Low oil prices and transportation constraints have hobbled the crucial energy sector. Record debt levels are a dead weight on consumer spending. Policy makers don\u2019t even know for sure how past rate increases \u2014 five since mid-2017 \u2014 are affecting households.Investors, more pessimistic than analysts, are betting on cuts rather than hikes. They see an 80 per cent chance of one rate cut over the next 12 months. In the U.S., conviction on lower rates is even stronger, with at least two rate cuts priced in over that period.Still, the Bank of Canada has shown no inclination to loosen policy. For one, officials are wary of encouraging more borrowing in an economy already saddled with debt. Underlying price pressures, meanwhile, have been hovering around the 2 per cent target for more than a year. As recently as last week, Poloz continued to argue for the long-term need for higher rates.There are also federal elections. While the central bank in the past has adjusted rates in the months leading up to a general vote, policy makers would need to consider the political optics of any move \u2014 either up or down. That raises the bar for any change.The most likely reason for the Bank of Canada to be pulled off the sidelines before the October election would be an adverse global economic or financial event. This could take the form of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, a correction in global financial markets, a cut in rates by the Federal Reserve \u2014 or a combination of these.Outside of global developments, there aren\u2019t any obvious made-in-Canada triggers for Poloz to move in the next six months.The central bank has already cut its first-half growth forecast to below what most analysts expect. That means policy makers are unlikely to be disappointed enough by the data to contemplate a cut.Recent economic numbers on employment, housing and manufacturing have actually surprised to the upside \u2014 but no one believes a better-than-expected performance in the first six months of this year will be enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to seriously consider a hike.The Bank of Canada is more optimistic about the economy in the second half and into 2020, when it expects growth to sustainably return to more normal levels of about 2 per cent. If that scenario plays out, then rate hikes are possible. If the numbers disappoint, cuts could be on the table.\u201cThe battleground is going to be the third quarter,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada. The \u201cearliest that you can expect something from the bank \u2014 I think it\u2019s also on the down rather than the up \u2014 would be\u201d at the Oct. 30 rate decision.The full picture for that quarter however won\u2019t appear until output data are released at the end of November.

The Canadian yield curve is inverted, with three-month government debt yielding more than 10-year notes, suggesting fear the dispute will weigh on global growth. The rates market is pricing in 17 basis points of central bank easing through the next 12 months, according to trading of forward contracts.But the Bank of Canada has been resolute. Governor Stephen Poloz said May 17 that there\u2019s much evidence the economy is strong, calling signs to the contrary just a \u201cdetour\u201d and saying interest rates will rise once the headwinds dissipate. The central bank will reveal its latest policy decision Wednesday morning.The pesky trade dispute seems to be the wild card here. And it\u2019s little wonder why: The U.S. and China are Canada\u2019s biggest trading partners.The BoC is \u201ccaught between big global uncertainties that are negative and recent data surprises erring on the positive side,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency in the U.S. and Canada for the market to take a more dovish view of expected policy than policy makers. The curve will be another element encouraging caution.\u201dAround the world, traders have pushed bond yields lower, as appetite for risk assets wanes and central banks around the globe cut forecasts for growth. The trade war has taken a toll on sentiment, weighing on global stocks and sapping demand for most commodities.The foreign-exchange market isn\u2019t pricing in a dovish central-bank policy stance in Canada just yet. As of Friday, the loonie was still the best performer among currencies from Group-of-10 nations in 2019, supported by crude oil, which had gained 30 per cent this year despite recent losses. The loonie was up 1.5 per cent this year versus the U.S. dollar.Still, the outlook is cloudy. For Canada, 17 per cent of its economic growth is exposed to the fight between the U.S. and China, according to a May 24 report from Bloomberg Intelligence economists. That means the Canadian dollar is 10 per cent overvalued, they argued.Recent economic data indicating strong Canadian employment and retail sales strengthen Poloz\u2019s optimistic position even after the central bank last month abandoned its bias toward rate hikes and dropped a reference to future increases. Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Canada economic surprise index, which measures data surprises relative to market expectations, is at the highest level since April 2017.\u201cThat outperformance alone tilts the balance of risks towards a constructive assessment of prospects\u201d in the next BoC policy statement, Shaun Osborne, strategist at Scotiabank, wrote in a May 24 note to clients. It \u201cprovides the basis for a mildly hawkish hold decision from the policy makers.\u201d He sees the Canadian dollar strengthening to end the year at 78.12 US cents against the greenback. It finished Friday at $74.62.Others aren\u2019t so bullish. The loonie will weaken toward 73.96 US cents after Wednesday\u2019s decision, strategists Andrew Kelvin and Mark McCormick at TD Securities wrote in a note May 24. They expect the yield differences between 5-year and 10-year as well as 10-year and 30-year Canadian government debt to narrow.\u201cThe balance of risk around the BoC also supports continued flattening,\u201d they said.

One approach would return the portfolio to a composition similar to outstanding Treasury securities, while another would result in a shorter-term maturity structure of three years or less.The staff analysis showed that a move to the shorter-term portfolio \u201cwould put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook,\u201d the minutes said.In their discussion of a portfolio proportional to the Treasury market, \u201cparticipants observed that moving to this target\u201d of portfolio composition \u201cwould not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks.\u201dSeveral participants judged that the proportional approach would be \u201cwell aligned with the committee\u2019s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy.\u201d At the same time, some of the debate focused on how much capacity each strategy would allow for adding economic stimulus through a maturity extension program.Investors have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates later this year partly on concern over inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, which prices have done for most of the last seven years.On the economic outlook, \u201cmany participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated,\u201d according to the minutes.GDP expanded at a 3.2 per cent annual pace in the first quarter,surpassing expectations, and unemployment hit a 49-year low in April.

That trounced the median economist forecast for a gain of 12,000 positions. The country\u2019s jobless rate dropped to 5.7 per cent, and is hovering near four-decade lows.\u201cAs much as I try to poke holes in these numbers, I can\u2019t,\u201d Derek Holt, an economist at Scotiabank, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cYou\u2019ve got sector breadth, you\u2019ve got regional breadth, the four biggest provinces are up.\u201dThe report reaffirms just how much the labour market has been the main driver of Canada\u2019s expansion and ratifies the central bank\u2019s view the recent slowdown would be temporary. Friday\u2019s numbers add to other indicators that show the country is on the path back to growth after stalling for much of the past six months.The Canadian dollar jumped 0.7 per cent to 74.70 US cents at 9:54 a.m. in Toronto. Two-year Canadian government bond yields climbed 4 basis points to 1.62 per cent, as investors pared bets the Bank of Canada would need to cut rates to fuel the expansion.Canada has added 426,400 jobs over the past 12 months, the largest one-year increase since 2007 and up 2.3 per cent over that period. Over the past two years, the economy has added 700,000 jobs.\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s a little more strength left in the Canadian economy,\u201d Brian DePratto, a senior economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said in a telephone interview.For months, the labour market had been the lone bright spot in a struggling economy, and was the only thing giving policy makers much comfort.We have a plan to grow our economy \u2013 and it\u2019s working. Canadians have created over 1 million jobs since 2015, including more than 100,000 in the last month alone \u2013 most of which are full time. https://t.co/ciuq0RYfNtAnalysts had warned as recently as last month that Canada ran the risk of falling into a recession amid a perfect storm of negative factors \u2014 falling oil prices, volatile financial markets, higher interest rates, cooling housing markets and global trade tensions. But many of these elements have begun to reverse.Exporters showed across-the-board resiliency in March, after shipments tumbled in February. Toronto\u2019s housing market, the country\u2019s largest, is stabilizing after a recent slump. There are also signs consumers continue to spend and borrow, aided in large part by the strong labour market, even amid worries about the outlook.The job gains in April were broad-based \u2013 across industries, regions and demographics \u2014with few weaknesses. Most of the gains were full-time, up 73,000, and in the private sector. Both goods-producing and services sectors recorded gains.Even wages \u2013 which have been sluggish \u2013 are showing signs of life. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.5 per cent in April, the fastest annual gain since September, up from 2.4 per cent in March. Pay gains for permanent employees rose to 2.6 per cent, the strongest increase since August.Total hours worked also picked up, increasing by 1.3 per cent annually in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.The jobs increases have largely reflected higher labour force numbers as the economy pulls in new workers \u2013 youth and immigrants in particular \u2013 rather than falling unemployment. The number of people in the labour force jumped by 108,100 in April, also a one-month record, on a surge in youth participation.\u201cWe\u2019re drawing in people, and that tells you how tight the labour market is,\u201d Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics, said by phone.Regionally, there were gains in most provinces including Alberta, which saw 21,400 jobs created. Employment in Ontario jumped by 47,000 in April, with job increases in Canada\u2019s largest province at 205,000 over the past year. Quebec employment rose by 38,000, dropping its unemployment rate to 4.9 per cent, the lowest in data going back to 1976.Strong increases in youth employment also lowered the unemployment rate for that demographic to record lows.Erik Hertzberg and Josh Wingrove contributed to this report"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Toronto housing market starts buying season with a bang, sales up 17%", "description": "Average selling price climbs 1.9% to $820,148", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-begins-busy-spring-season-with-a-bounce?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cpt128-the-canadian-press-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 6, 2019 2:03 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market entered the busy spring property season with a bang, as sales surged 17 per cent in April compared with a year earlier and prices also pushed higher.The number of transactions totalled 9,042 units last month, compared with 7,744 units in April 2018, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Monday.

While the expansion is poised to become the nation\u2019s longest on record at midyear, economists expect a deceleration this year even after a strong first quarter.Revisions for February and March added 16,000 more jobs than previously reported, while the three-month average fell to 169,000.Friday\u2019s data follow a Federal Open Market Committee statement Wednesday saying \u201cthe labor market remains strong.\u201d Officials in March forecast a 3.7 per cent unemployment rate at year end.The payroll gains were somewhat uneven, with construction, health care, and professional and business services posting gains while retail employment fell by 12,000 for a third- straight decline.Construction payrolls climbed by 33,000, the most since January, as manufacturing employment rose by 4,000.

The unanimous 10-0 decision left the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate at 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. Reporters are likely to prod him over whether upside and downside risks remain truly balanced in the eyes of policy makers.Officials also adjusted one of the tools they use to keep the fed funds rate within its target range.\u00a0In addition to weighing economic developments, Fed officials have endured a steady drumbeat of criticism from Trump over past rate hikes. Powell and his colleagues have said repeatedly they\u2019ll ignore the pressure and chart policy according to what best suits the longer-run prospects of the world\u2019s largest economy.As with recent economic data, the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s assessment of conditions had something for both hawks and doves.Officials slightly upgraded their assessment of the economy, saying \u201ceconomic activity rose at a solid rate\u201d while \u201cthe labour market remains strong.\u201dThat characterization followed a report this week showing consumer spending rebounded in March following a lacklustre start to the year. Previous data had pointed to the consumer as a weak spot in an otherwise solid first quarter.The economy expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized pace from January to March, boosted by exports and inventories growth. The labour market remains robust, with unemployment at around a half- century low and wage gains near the best pace of this expansion.Still, even with consumption intact and the labour market tightening, inflation has remained vexingly low. The Fed\u2019s preferred price gauge climbed just 1.5 per cent in March from a year earlier, well below the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target.In subtle changes from their last statement, officials said gauges for both overall and core inflation \u201chave declined and are running below 2 per cent.\u201d That removed a line from March blaming energy prices for below-target price gains and removed a reference to core inflation being \u201cnear 2 per cent.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s fears over low inflation have been mounting, with Powell recently calling it \u201cone of the major challenges of\u00a0our\u00a0time.\u201d That\u2019s spurred some speculation that a further slowing in core price gains could prompt officials to cut rates even during a healthy expansion.In a supplemental statement, officials adjusted a tool they use to keep the fed funds rate within its target range, lowering the interest paid on bank reserves deposited with the Fed to 2.35 per cent from 2.4 per cent.This was the third such adjustment in a year for interest on excess reserves, or IOER. As in June and December, the step was taken after the rate banks pay to borrow overnight, known as the effective fed funds rate, drifted upward and threatened to reach the upper end of the target range.The move \u201cis intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC\u2019s target range,\u201d the technical statement said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Catherine Traywick", "title": "Energy's #MeToo moment: Ex-Anadarko employee alleges culture where women treated as \u2018sexual playthings\u2019", "description": "Allegations at Denver office include loutish behaviour, such as a supervisor who joked women seeking to advance careers be prepared to provide oral sex", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/sexual-playthings-metoo-moment-for-anadarkos-denver-office", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/anadarko.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 16, 2019 11:43 AM EDT", "content": "Soon after Robin Olsen left her job in the Denver office of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., she drafted a letter with her lawyer\u2019s help.\u201cAnadarko has a culture of treating women as sexual playthings who are present at work merely for men\u2019s sexual gratification,\u201d it said.Olsen\u2019s 2017 letter to Anadarko went on to describe a toxic culture in the satellite office, where 550 of the company\u2019s 4,700 employees work, and where she said sexual harassment wasn\u2019t punished and women who complained about it were.Anadarko, which agreed last week to be sold to Chevron Corp. for US$33 billion, vigorously disputes Olsen\u2019s characterizations of the company.Even as the #MeToo movement \u2014 and the backlash against it \u2014 rolls through the corridors of power, the energy industry has largely escaped the scandals that have ensnared scores of prominent men in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Washington and beyond.Interviews with six former employees of Anadarko\u2019s Denver office paint a detailed picture of a place where life can be particularly difficult for women. The ex-employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they still have dealings with Anadarko or aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Allegations include loutish behaviour, such as the supervisor who joked that women seeking to advance their careers should be prepared to provide oral sex.They include talk about stunted careers, how the women became stuck in their jobs while the men they complained about moved up the corporate ladder. About how men were promoted while women with comparable experience weren\u2019t \u2014 such as the company announcing that the three male graduates of a leadership-training seminar would get better jobs than the three females in the same class.Olsen\u2019s letter to the company alleges that two high-ranking executives had sexual relationships with subordinates, an account corroborated in an affidavit, reviewed by Bloomberg, from Olsen\u2019s former supervisor, Christopher Castilian.Women\u2019s complaints changed the company. After the behaviour was exposed, Anadarko said it launched a formal sexual-harassment training program.Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko\u2019s Denver office oversees operations in Colorado and Wyoming, where nearly half the company\u2019s onshore acreage is located.For its part, Chevron \u201chas a zero-tolerance policy, and any form of workplace discrimination \u2014 gender, racial or otherwise \u2014 is unacceptable,\u201d spokesman Kent Robertson said in an email.In the oil and gas industry, just one of every five employees is female. At Anadarko, less than one-quarter of employees worldwide are female. Women account for two per cent of industry chief executives, compared with five per cent for S&P 500 companies. One of Anadarko\u2019s six executive officers is a woman.\u201cWe have our problems in our industry, whether it\u2019s the hanky panky you hear about, the inappropriateness you hear about after hours, or whatever,\u201d said Katie Mehnert, the founder of women\u2019s energy organization Pink Petro who has worked at Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. \u201cBut the culture is going to evolve quicker now, because you can\u2019t hide anything.

There's just a glass doorTwo of the former Anadarko employees spoke of a supervisor, known for joking that female employees should provide oral sex to get better jobs, who was promoted while the women who complained about him were passed over and eventually left the company.One woman said her supervisor gave her derisive nicknames, publicly joked about her presumed sexual activity and cut her annual bonus when she complained.Jennifer Brice, an Anadarko spokeswoman, said in a statement to Bloomberg that the company has taken steps to address complaints, including launching sexual-harassment and unconscious-bias training, increasing awareness of Anadarko\u2019s 24-hour anonymous hotline, and strengthening its policy on retaliation.\u201cWe strive to create a work environment that is inclusive for all of our employees, and have acted on the concerns we\u2019ve heard,\u201d Brice said. \u201cEach case involving specific claims and concerns was investigated once received.\u201dThe company has reinforced its zero-tolerance policy for retaliation, and over the last year has trained more than 2,900 of its employees in a program called \u201cSpeaking Up Creates Change,\u201d she said.The woman who described the leadership-training class \u2014 where the company announced the three male graduates would get better jobs than the three females \u2014 said she complained to human resources. She said she received a bump in pay but not a change in job title. After that, she said, she was passed over for promotions.\u201cPay equity is something we take very seriously, and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics expressly states our commitment to diversity in recruiting, hiring, developing, compensating and promoting employees,\u201d said Brice, the Anadarko spokeswoman.Anadarko\u2019s general counsel annually reviews pay practices and provides advice on avoiding discrimination on the basis of gender, Brice said. \u201cManagement is routinely reminded and trained on the Code\u2019s requirement to make decisions about pay, promotions and other employment-related actions without regard to gender or any other protected category.\u201dOlsen\u2019s letter alleges that Brad Holly, who oversaw the company\u2019s Rocky Mountain assets, and Scott Moore, who supervised marketing, carried on sexual relationships with female subordinates. Olsen said she frequently heard the executives having sex with the women behind closed doors in the office, the letter said. When she complained, Holly and Moore stopped speaking to her and gave away plum assignments that were part of her job description that could\u2019ve led to career advancement, according to the letter.The claims of inappropriate relationships involving Denver-based officers of the company \u201cwere promptly and thoroughly investigated,\u201d Brice said. \u201cThe individuals referenced are no longer with the company.\u201dAfter the complaints about Moore\u2019s behaviour, the company held sexual-harassment training in the Denver office, former employees said. The seminar gave real-world examples of employees who had violated the company\u2019s policies on hostile work environments.Brice said Anadarko has strengthened its policies \u201cto specifically prohibit any officer from engaging in an intimate relationship with any employee, regardless of the reporting relationship.\u201dOlsen, who signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of her settlement with the company, said she resolved her differences with Anadarko. She declined to comment further.The women allegedly involved in the trysts left the company. Anadarko gave two promotions each to Holly and Moore within two years of the women\u2019s departures.Moore, who left the company in 2018, declined to comment, saying personnel matters should be addressed by Anadarko.\u201cI have always been a strong advocate for equality, inclusion and mentorship and am proud of my record for advancing the careers of talented professionals in our industry,\u201d Holly said in a statement to Bloomberg. \u201cI certainly never engaged in any discriminatory or retaliatory conduct, and any allegations that I engaged in inappropriate behaviour in the office are categorically false.\u201dOne woman described gender problems in the Denver office to Holly in an email reviewed by Bloomberg. She warned Holly they would lead to an exodus of talent.\u201cWhile I do not recall the specific email referenced,\u201d Holly said, \u201cI believe that clear protocols and processes are vital to an equitable and respectful work environment and would have referred any reports of discrimination or retaliation to the Human Resources department for investigation.\u201dIn May 2017, after Olsen left the company, Holly was promoted to executive vice president of the Rockies Region, the highest-ranking executive in the Denver office.

The nine-bedroom home, dubbed \u201cThe Castle\u201d by the 14 students who share the property, is apparently owned by an Afghani pop artist, according to Boodhoo.\u201cHonestly, I would stay here for as long as I could,\u201d he said, sitting on a white couch while sipping from a Slurpee cup. \u201c$1,000 bucks for all this?\u201dOthers may also soon find themselves as lucky as more mansion owners in the city turn to renting to avoid a new tax on empty homes. In the new world of Vancouver\u2019s housing market, where Chinese investors are decamping and low-ball offers are the norm, students can find themselves living in the lap of luxury.It\u2019s a far cry from the frenzy of a few years ago when the city was at the centre of a global property boom. Prices more than doubled in the decade through 2016, outpacing gains in New York and London. But government policies to tame the market \u2014 from new taxes to stricter mortgage regulations \u2014 have fuelled a plunge in sales to the weakest since the global financial crisis. Prices are down 8.5 per cent from their peak in June, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.The city boasts a thriving tech and tourism scene and sits in the province with the lowest unemployment rate in the country. But the sense of unease in the real estate market is palpable.Here are some stories from a property market in upheaval:With taxes on an empty Vancouver home potentially adding up to 3 per cent in annual levies, homeowners are rushing to lease their homes, according to real estate agents. That\u2019s leading to bargains in a city where the vacancy rate has been near zero per cent.\u201cYou have houses that are worth $4 million renting for $4,500,\u201d said Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor whose popular real estate blog was pointing out cracks in the market even as benchmark prices peaked last year.Prospective tenants are getting bold, said Kevin Wang, who runs a sales and rental real estate team with his twin brother Jerry. They\u2019ve received calls from people offering to help with gardening or maintenance in exchange for free rent in a luxury home.The owner of \u201cThe Castle\u201d\u00a0and the rental agency didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Everyday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I'm just like, that's my houseFor his part, Boodhoo, not only has he scored luxury digs, he\u2019s cut his commute time to his classes in music production to about 18 minutes from two hours.\u201cEveryday I come home from school and I see just the tips of the castle, and I\u2019m just like, that\u2019s my house,\u201d said Boodhoo, who\u2019s looking forward to the pool in the backyard. It should be filled by June.Lisa Sun paces around the Vancouver mansion she\u2019s been hired to sell by its wealthy Chinese-Canadian owner. The family\u2019s had it with the new taxes and what it sees as increasing hostility to Asian capital. Sun reckons that early last year the home would have easily sold for about $8.5 million \u2014 holes in the wall and all.Today, the 28-year-old realtor isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll get a credible offer for the 8,343 square-foot mansion. These days a pool, wine cellar, and home theatre on a prime lot aren\u2019t enough to clinch a deal, even in West Vancouver, where opulent homes carved out of steep slopes overlook the ocean. Sun needs a \u201cstager\u201d to empty the house and brighten it up with new furniture, a modern chandelier, and lick of paint.\u201cI\u2019ve been through only the peak, never the low,\u201d said Sun as she schedules a makeover of the property. Pink tags indicate to the four cleaners what needs to be dumped. The Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce in the garage, relatively unused for three years, also need to be dealt with.The house is listed at $10.9 million, but after receiving mostly low-ball offers closer to its tax-assessed value of $6.2 million, she\u2019s planning on dropping the asking price closer to $8.3 million.Why would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?That\u2019s a hefty cut but holding on to the home would mean paying potentially more than $140,000 in extra taxes annually for the Canadian owner who splits her time between Vancouver and Beijing. Canadian taxes are not the only measures weighing on the market. China\u2019s capital controls are also limiting spending on global real estate.Sun doesn\u2019t think Vancouver\u2019s market is going to come back to its highs, especially at the top end. \u201cWhy would they come here and pay all that tax and feel like a criminal?\u201dBuying a house seemed an impossible dream for Brandon Chapman.The 28-year-old financial planner first started looking at one-bedroom condos in 2016, around the peak of the market. \u201cIt was just bananas so I took a step back,\u201d he said, in an interview at his Vancouver office.He\u2019s glad he waited. He now figures he might even be able to afford a detached home and is viewing properties at around the $1.1 million mark in East Vancouver. To make it affordable, he\u2019s teaming up with his best friend to purchase the property \u2014 and offering way under asking. It hasn\u2019t quite worked out yet. One offer for about $200,000 less than the listing price was rejected.It's like a candy store for buyers right now\u201cWe haven\u2019t closed on anything but the market in my opinion is still trending down so why would I rush into buying something if I don\u2019t need it this second?\u201d he said.Then there\u2019s Robin Rickards, who happened to be looking for a temporary home at a serendipitous time. The 64-year-old orthopedic surgeon needed a place to stay while his current home was being rebuilt into an oceanside oasis. He ended up making an offer on three different homes and got one for almost $1 million less than the original asking price.\u201cIt\u2019s like a candy store for buyers right now,\u201d Clara Hartree, the realtor working with Rickards, said by email.The twisty, cantilevered glass tower is one of Vancouver\u2019s most hotly anticipated developments. It starts as a triangle at its base \u2014 wedged awkwardly between the on and off ramps of a downtown highway \u2014 before swivelling into a square at the top.That iconic silhouette helped developer Westbank Corp. rapidly sell out some 400 ultra-luxe units when presales began in 2014, thanks in part to avid interest from Asian buyers. As it nears completion, investors are seeking to offload rights to more than two dozen\u00a0units, according to listings cropping up on realtor websites.One flyer offers a 368-square-foot unit at $515,000. \u201cTransfer at original price,\u201d it reads in Chinese. Last year, it would\u2019ve fetched as much as $800,000, says Jerry Huang, a realtor with Nu Stream Realty Inc., which specializes in presale developments.\u201cThat\u2019s an insane deal,\u201d he said. Presales were once seen as a slam dunk \u2014 put down a 20 per cent deposit, flip the contract at a premium before completion, and pocket the gains.Westbank said in an email that in the five years since some investors purchased, values have appreciated from 25 per cent to 100 per cent depending on the unit. The number of so-called assignment sales is less than 10 per cent of total units in the building and \u201cin-line with expectation.\u201dThe job of the real estate agent has become much tougher nowBut the broader downturn is beginning to catch some out across various developments.Those who bought at the peak need to find a buyer fast or come up with the full amount to pay the developer. With banks in some cases assessing units lower than the contract price, buyers hoping for a loan may face a shortfall. \u201cThere are no assurances right now,\u201d says Adil Dinani, a realtor with Royal LePage \u2014 some sellers may be lucky just to break even.There have always been buyers who overextended and needed to sell quickly.\u201cBut the difference is earlier, we were able to help them because the market was going up,\u201d says Sonny Bhinder, a realtor who\u2019s received calls from half a dozen clients seeking to sell assignments since the start of the year. \u201cThe job of the real estate agent has become much tougher now.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Feifei Shen, Paul Panckhurst and Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou", "title": "The Canadian dollar has been on a tear this year, but it's bullish run might be about to end", "description": "The loonie's resiliency could soon be tested if crude loses momentum", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-dollars-bullish-2019-run-may-soon-run-out-of-fuel", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2019 12:23 PM EDT", "content": "A surge of close to 40 per cent in oil prices has helped make the Canadian dollar one of this year\u2019s best performing major currencies. That resiliency could soon be tested if crude loses momentum.Many forecasters appear skeptical about the prospects for oil to advance much beyond its current level, potentially sapping some support from the loonie. West Texas Intermediate was at around US$63 per barrel on Monday and the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey is for it to end the year near that level.\u201cWe don\u2019t see the same impetus coming from oil prices,\u201d said Bipan Rai, the North American head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cSo it begs the question about whether we can rely on incoming data to really drive some support for the loonie. That\u2019s still pretty much a wild card.\u201dThe Canadian dollar has advanced 1.9 per cent this year against the U.S. currency, trailing only the British pound among its Group-of-10 peers. Oil has provided some buoyancy, but Canada\u2019s domestic picture has been more cloudy. There is mounting concern about household indebtedness, home prices are dropping and growth practically ground to a halt in the final part of 2018. A Bank of Canada survey released Monday that showed softening business sentiment dented the loonie, dragging it down around 0.4 per cent on the day.While growth numbers for January were more upbeat and unemployment remains close to multi-decade lows, the central bank has become more circumspect. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz this month suggested that he is settling into a holding pattern on interest-rate policy. The global slowdown, coupled with a housing sector that is taking longer to adjust to tighter mortgage rules and higher rates, means the economy still needs the help of low borrowing costs, the BOC boss said.\u201cCanada\u2019s got to worry about an additional factor that the U.S. doesn\u2019t at this point, and that is the fact that our household sector is extremely leveraged,\u201d said Rai, who is based in Toronto. \u201cIt could prove to be a much more prolonged slowdown given that you may see households deleveraging.\u201dHe sees the loonie weakening to around $1.36 per greenback by the end of this year and $1.40 in 2020. It was at $1.3377 on Monday.Toronto-Dominion Bank also sees the Canadian currency coming under pressure, with currency strategist Mazen Issa pointing not only to risks from household debt but also potential spillover effects from international trade fights.\u201cWe\u2019re basically looking at a situation that is very difficult to find any positives for the Canadian dollar overall,\u201d said Issa. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s probably going to continue to get worse.\u201dNot all observers are so pessimistic though. Bank of Montreal\u2019s global head of foreign-exchange strategy, Greg Anderson, expects the loonie to rally to $1.30 per dollar by year end, while Scotiabank forecasts it will go to to $1.27.Eric Theoret at Scotiabank sees a weak greenback environment fuelling commodity-price gains and boosting Canada\u2019s terms of trade, and says there\u2019s room for improvement in the currency if crude prices continue to rise.\u201cIf oil prices keep moving the way they are, it should allow the Bank of Canada to withdraw some of the accommodation that they are currently providing,\u201d said Theoret.Even if oil recovers, RBC Wealth Management expects the Canadian dollar to trade around its current levels until mid-year, with some modest softness taking it to a range of $1.34 to $1.36 per dollar by year end. Laura Cooper, head of FX solutions and strategy at RBC Wealth, sees limited scope for oil to bolster the loonie because pipeline constraints are helping to maintain a price gap between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark price. She\u2019s also doubtful of any major shift from rate differentials, since both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are signaling extended tightening-cycle pauses.\u201cIn the absence of a catalyst coming from rate dynamics or commodity prices, we see the currency trading broadly sideways in coming months,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s business sentiment gauge turns negative and drops to lowest since 2016", "description": "Economic slowdown and trade tensions have begun to impact business confidence", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-business-sentiment-softens-amid-slowing-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/banks-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2019 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s recent economic slowdown and global trade tensions have begun to impact businesses confidence, according to a Bank of Canada survey.The Ottawa-based central bank\u2019s first-quarter survey of executives \u2014 which took place in February and March \u2014 showed softening expectations for sales along with a sharp decline in the number of companies reporting labour shortages.

Those gains however were out of line with other indicators that showed production stalling at the end of last year, in part because of falling oil prices.The strong performance of the jobs market up to now has been one of the reasons why the Bank of Canada has stuck to its belief the economy will rebound later this year.Labour force numbers, which had been rising strongly along with jobs, also declined slightly in March, down by 11,300.The employment decrease in March was driven by a 17,300 drop in private-sector jobs, with public sector employment up slightly last month. Health-care and accommodation led the job losses. Among provinces, Quebec and Ontario saw the largest declines, with combined losses of 21,700.The labour market continues to improve in one respect: annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.4 per cent in March,the fastest annual gain since September, up from 2.3 per cent in February.Pay gains for permanent employees rose to 2.3 per cent, the strongest increase since August.Total hours worked also picked up in March, increasing by 0.9 per cent annually, after a drop of 0.1 per cent the previous month.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeanna Smialek", "title": "Fed sees no 2019 rate hikes, plans September end to asset drawdown", "description": "The Fed's signal that it will keep interest rates on hold for the full year reflects concerns that economic growth is slowing", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-sees-no-2019-rate-hikes-plans-september-end-to-asset-drawdown", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 20, 2019 2:28 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials scaled back their projected interest-rate increases this year to zero and said they would end the drawdown of the central bank\u2019s bond holdings in September after holding policy steady on Wednesday.The median rate projection of Fed officials compared with two hikes in the December forecasts, which spooked investors at the time. In its statement following a two-day meeting in Washington, the Federal Open Market Committee repeated January language that it will be \u201cpatient\u201d amid \u201cglobal economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s signal that it will keep interest rates on hold for the full year reflects concerns that economic growth is slowing, lower energy prices are weighing on inflation and risks from abroad are dimming the outlook. The projections go further than the one-hike forecast analysts had expected in a Bloomberg survey.In a separate statement Wednesday, the Fed said it would start slowing the shrinking of its balance sheet in May and halt the drawdown altogether at the end of September. After that, the Fed will likely hold the size of the portfolio \u201croughly constant for a time,\u201d which will allow reserve balances to gradually decline.Beginning in October, the Fed will roll its maturing holdings of mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, using a cap of US$20 billion per month. The initial investment in new Treasury maturities will \u201croughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding,\u201d the Fed said. The central bank is still deliberating the longer-run composition of its portfolio and said \u201climited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run.\u201dThe 10-0 decision held the target range of the federal funds rate steady at 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Powell is scheduled to begin a press conference at 2:30 p.m.While the central bank is very close to its twin goals of low and stable inflation and full employment, Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues must contend with risks from abroad, including slowing growth in Europe and China and possible spillovers from Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.Those headwinds contributed to sharp financial-market volatility late last year. U.S. stocks recorded their steepest December losses since the Great Depression as President Donald Trump publicly hammered Powell to stop raising rates and investors saw the Fed\u2019s projected hikes as a policy mistake.Stocks have rebounded since the Fed made a dovish pivot in January, replacing a reference to further gradual rate increases with a pledge for patience. Wednesday marked policy makers\u2019 first opportunity since December to lay out in quarterly forecasts the extent to which their projections for hikes have changed.Economic growth \u201chas slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,\u201d the FOMC said in its statement. \u201cJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months\u201d despite \u201clittle changed\u201d payrolls in February. \u201cOverall inflation has declined,\u201d though excluding food and energy it \u201cremains near 2 per cent,\u201d the central bank said.Policymakers also lowered economic-growth projections for this year and next, giving a 2.1 per cent median estimate for 2019, a full percentage point below last year\u2019s pace.The less upbeat assessment in the statement compared with January\u2019s language saying growth was solid, consumer spending was strong and business investment had moderated.The projections showed 11 of 17 officials saw no hikes this year, while four expected one rate increase and two people projected two hikes. Policymakers expect to lift rates once in 2020, to 2.6 per cent by the end of that year, and hold them steady in 2021.That compares with a December projection for a 3.1 per cent rate in 2020 and 2021, with borrowing costs converging to 2.75 per cent in the longer run, according to the median path. That long-run estimate was unchanged in Wednesday\u2019s forecasts.The Fed formally adopted its 2 per cent inflation goal in 2012, and price gains have mostly come in on the low side since then.Policymakers slightly lowered their expectations for inflation relative to their last set of economic projections. After 1.8 per cent headline inflation in 2019, they see price gains of 2 per cent on both the main and core indexes for the next two years, eliminating the overshoot they had previously projected.Officials see unemployment at 3.7 per cent by year-end, higher than their previous estimate of 3.5 per cent. At the same time, they lowered their long-run jobless rate projection to 4.3 per cent, suggesting the labour market is running less hot than they previously thought.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Why central banks \u2014 including Canada's \u2014 are finding it so hard to get interest rates back to 'normal' territory", "description": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz acknowledges he's getting heat over higher borrowing costs from Canadians themselves", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/why-central-banks-like-canadas-are-finding-it-hard-to-navigate-home", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 14, 2019 1:12 PM EDT", "content": "Central bankers have long been crafting analogies to explain what they do \u2014 think taking away the punch bowl. Few have been as devoted to the art as Stephen Poloz.He\u2019s trying to steer the economy back to a place where it can support the kind of borrowing costs that counted as normal before 2008. But Poloz\u2019s metaphors often have to do with unforeseen hardships when you\u2019re on the way home \u2014 sailors blown off course, or drivers caught in winter storms. Because, like many global peers, he\u2019s finding the journey hard to map out.One reason is a feature of today\u2019s developed economies that isn\u2019t normal at all by past standards: their mountain of private debt. Canada has some of the most leveraged households anywhere \u2014 leading analysts to question how much higher rates can go, and even whether they\u2019ve already gone too far.With five interest-rate increases since 2017, the Bank of Canada is one of a handful to embark on sustained hiking. Poloz has even won international recognition for developing frameworks to manage the process. But there\u2019s been no increase since October, and the Ottawa-based bank said last week that the cycle\u2019s immediate future looks increasingly uncertain amid a global slowdown. Like the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s essentially on hold, waiting to see what happens.Poloz acknowledges he\u2019s getting heat over higher borrowing costs, in a country where so many households have a direct stake. People write to him. \u201cBelieve me, I feel it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a theoretical exercise.\u201dThat helps explain the folksy analogies \u2014 and also Poloz\u2019s discretionary approach. He shuns the precision of models, sees data more in terms of feeling a pulse than feeding a machine, and recognizes that central banking involves mystery as well as technical expertise.The goal is to assure as wide a chunk of the public as possible that policy makers won\u2019t hike unless they\u2019re sure the economy can cope with higher borrowing costs. As long as inflation isn\u2019t a threat, they\u2019ll put growth first.In the global monetary debate after 2008, Poloz has often been on the dovish side \u2014 particularly early in his term.The concern, then and now, is that cheap money is a zero-sum game. It brings spending forward, but slows it down in the future, and adds financial vulnerabilities \u2014 like high household debt and elevated housing prices in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.Poloz counters by pointing out that the leverage already out there makes tightening risky too. Plus, he sees potential long-term benefits from frontloading demand.Exports and investment remain below pre-crisis levels as a share of the economy, leaving Canada reliant on consumption and housing. Wage gains are smaller than in the past. The number of new firms being created, an important metric for Poloz, is lacklustre. What if Canada\u2019s economy is on the cusp of an investment boom that may not be detectable yet, and companies are holding back because they lack confidence? Productivity typically picks up late in the business cycle, and policy makers shouldn\u2019t get in the way of that by removing stimulus too quickly.Yet, if the purpose of low rates has been to nurse the economy back to normal, then the ability to raise them should be the ultimate gauge of health.With the jobless rate at four-decade lows, and underlying inflation back near the two per cent target, there were signs that the economy was nearing its capacity \u2014 which is why Poloz began to hike.The Bank of Canada has been envisaging a final resting place for rates around three per cent. But so far it\u2019s only got about halfway there. And as other central banks scale back their expectations, investors are anticipating that Poloz will have to follow.Markets no longer believe he\u2019ll be able to raise rates any further \u2014 or that Canada\u2019s economy, burdened by heavy debt and aging demographics, can grow much faster than the current, modest pace. Ten-year Canadian bond yields are stuck below two per cent, lower even than they were on Poloz\u2019s first day on the job in 2013.That raises an awkward question for Poloz, and maybe for some of his central-bank peers too: Has monetary policy already done all it can?As he prepares to enter the final year of his seven-year term, Poloz could lay claim to be one of Canada\u2019s most successful central bankers ever. The country is closer to a state of full employment and stable prices than at any time since the 1960s \u2014 exactly the sort of benchmarks policy makers are supposed to aim for.It\u2019s just that one of the slowest recoveries on record wouldn\u2019t be a very satisfying finish line. Most economists currently put potential growth at no higher than two per cent. In the last six quarters the economy hasn\u2019t even managed that, averaging 1.6 per cent.As well as telling stories about journeys home, Poloz also likes to invoke \u201cMother Nature\u201d and argue that economies are capable of regenerating themselves. In the interview, he expressed confidence that Canada can climb back toward the faster growth it once took for granted \u2014 if \u201call the ingredients work out.\u201d\u201cI see no reason why we should settle for our two per cent trend-line,\u201d he said.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "What gives?

The two-month gain is the best start to a year since 1981. Canada\u2019s economy has added 290,000 jobs since August, the largest six-month increase since the early 2000s.The much-stronger-than-expected labour market is the only thing giving policy makers comfort amid a run of bleak data in recent months. It\u2019s a key reason why the Bank of Canada is sticking to its belief the economy will rebound and interest rates will likely head higher.The employment gains in recent months come amid an otherwise dismal performance for the economy recently, amid stresses in the oil sector, weakening housing markets, volatility in global financial markets and waning consumer and business confidence. Economists were forecasting a gain of just 1,200 in February.Last week, Canada\u2019s statistics agency reported the nation\u2019s economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the final three months of 2018. Most economists expect the sluggishness to persist in the first six months of this year, before growth picks up steam later in 2019.The jobs increase largely reflects higher labor force numbers, rather than falling unemployment, due to rising participation rates and accelerating population growth over the past couple of years. Much of the increase in Canada\u2019s population comes from international working-age migrants. In an economy with more than half a million vacant jobs, many seem to be finding work.The labour force increased by 55,100 in February, and is up by 159,000 so far this year. Canada\u2019s jobless rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent, even with the employment gains, because more people were looking for work.The breakdown in the numbers was also positive, with 67,400 new full-time jobs offsetting a loss of 11,600 part-time positions.Even the wage picture is looking better. Annual average hourly gains accelerated to 2.3 per cent in February from 2 per cent a month earlier, with pay for permanent employees up 2.2 per cent, from 1.8 per cent previously.One weakness was total hours worked, which fell 0.1 per cent in February from a year earlier.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou", "title": "Yields are signaling that the Bank of Canada could take rate hikes right off the table", "description": "Deteriorating economic data have traders shifting gears", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bond-traders-are-trimming-bets-on-bank-of-canada-hikes", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 5, 2019 5:38 PM EST", "content": "The spread between Canadian and U.S. two-year government-debt yields is the widest since 2007 before Wednesday\u2019s Bank of Canada meeting, a sign traders are paring expectations for interest-rate hikes this year.Canada\u2019s two-year obligation yielded 1.74 per cent Tuesday, compared with 2.55 per cent for its U.S. counterpart, for a gap of 81 basis points.

Here\u2019s a look at why the bears won\u2019t be hibernating just yet.The U.S. president is considering whether to impose levies on imported vehicles on the basis they are a threat to national security. Such a move would hurt not just the U.S. economy, but big manufacturing ones including Germany, Japan and South Korea too. Higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory actions could jeopardize about US$500 billion of trade flows, accounting for 2.8 per cent of 2017 global imports, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Ltd.The world\u2019s second-largest economy has been struggling to contain a slowdown even as policy makers ramp up their stimulus measures to stoke growth. Much will depend on how durable the trade truce is, given the breadth of concerns that the U.S. has regarding China\u2019s industrial and economic policies.\u201cI don\u2019t see the outlook for business investment globally improving markedly until we see more concrete plans for resolving the various issues between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore.While Federal Reserve policy makers see 2019 marking the end of their balance sheet run-off, it may not mean they are done raising interest rates. How Fed policy plays out will be crucial for emerging markets who have enjoyed a respite since Jerome Powell signalled a pause in the central bank\u2019s hiking cycle. Yet the dimming outlook for the world\u2019s biggest economy will drag the rest of the world, too, as fiscal stimulus fades and data shows signs of weakness.Britain is teetering on the brink of a cliff-edge departure from the European Union that lawmakers, economists and executives warn would spark economic chaos and drag on growth across key trading partners in Europe. Prime Minister Theresa May has set a new deadline of March 12 \u2014 just 17 days before Brexit day \u2014 for a final vote on her Brexit divorce agreement.Europe\u2019s biggest economy continues to send mixed signals amid persistent manufacturing weakness and soggy confidence levels. While improving consumption and investment hint at a pickup in coming months, there have been sharp downgrades to the growth outlook. Meanwhile, Italy sank into recession at the end of 2018 and is predicted to barely grow this year, leaving the economy to nurse huge debt, low growth and high unemployment.With assistance from Craig Torres and Jenny LeonardBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jordyn Holman", "title": "Lululemon\u2019s full-time U.S. workers can now get three to six months of paid parental leave", "description": "Eighty-four per cent of all workers in the U.S. don't have access to paid family leave", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/lululemons-full-time-u-s-workers-can-now-get-three-to-six-months-of-paid-parental-leave", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/lululemon.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 13, 2019 4:11 PM EST", "content": "Lululemon Athletica Inc. is beefing up benefits to attract and retain workers, offering full-time employees three to six months of paid parental leave.The gender-neutral benefit awards three months of paid leave to full-time workers who have been at the yogawear company for two years.

But one group of Apple contractors\u00a0finds another building, six miles away on Hammerwood Avenue in Sunnyvale, to be a more apt symbol.This building is as bland as the main Apple campus is striking. From the outside, there appears to be a reception area, but it\u2019s unstaffed, which makes sense given that people working in this satellite office \u2014 mostly employees of Apple contractors working on Apple Maps \u2014 use the back door. Workers say managers instructed them to walk several blocks away before calling for a ride home. Several people who worked here say it\u2019s widely referred to within Apple as a \u201cblack site,\u201d as in a covert ops facility.Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending machines to be understocked, and to have to wait in line to use the men\u2019s bathrooms. Architectural surprise and delight wasn\u2019t a priority here; after all, the contract workers at Hammerwood almost all leave after their assignments of 12 to 15 months are up.It\u2019s not uncommon for workers not to make it that long. According to 14\u00a0current and former contractors employed by Apex Systems, a firm that staffs the building as well as other Apple mapping offices, they operated under the constant threat of termination. \u201cIt was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time,\u201d says one former Hammerwood contractor, who, like most of the workers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with Apex. \u201cThere was a culture of fear among the contractors which I got infected by and probably spread.\u201dApex, not Apple, manages the workers it hires. Apple says it requires contracting firms to treat workers with \u201cdignity and respect.\u201d Following an inquiry from Bloomberg News, the company says, it conducted a surprise audit of the Hammerwood facility and found a work environment consistent with other Apple locations. \u201cLike we do with other suppliers, we will work with Apex to review their management systems, including recruiting and termination protocols, to ensure the terms and conditions of employment are transparent and clearly communicated to workers in advance,\u201d an Apple spokesperson says in a statement.Buddy Omohundro, Apex\u2019s chief services officer and general counsel, says in an email that his company strives to ensure it\u2019s creating the best possible work experience. \u201cApex provides multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns, both directly and anonymously, and to have those concerns addressed,\u201d he wrote.It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time.Apex is one tiny part of a sprawling global network of staffing firms working with Apple; it is not even the only firm staffing the facility at Hammerwood Avenue. For Apple Maps alone, workers are spread across several locations in Silicon Valley, as well as in Austin, Tex.; London; the Czech Republic; and India, according to people who worked on the project. The operation involves thousands of contractors. At Hammerwood, the population has exceeded 250 at times, although the number fluctuates and Apple declined to give a current count.Places like Hammerwood undermine the mythology of Silicon Valley as a kind of industrial utopia where talented people work themselves to the bone in exchange for outsize salaries and stock options. A common perception in the Bay Area is that its only serious tech-labour issue is the high cost of living driven by the industry\u2019s obscene salaries. But many of the poorer residents work in tech, too. For decades, contractors and other contingent workers have served meals, driven buses and cleaned toilets at tech campuses. They\u2019ve also built circuit boards and written and tested software, all in exchange for hourly wages and little or no job security.In different forms, temporary labour as an alternative to full-time employment has grown across the U.S. economy. Companies in many industries now use staffing firms to handle work once done by full-time workers. The technology industry offers one of the starkest examples of how the groups\u2019 fortunes have diverged. While companies aren\u2019t required to disclose the sizes of their contingent workforces, there\u2019s ample evidence that tech companies use large numbers of contractors and temps. Last year, Bloomberg News reported that direct employees at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0Google accounted for less than half its workforce.The treatment of these workers is emerging alongside sexual harassment and military contracting as a principal target of the wave of tech worker activism that\u2019s been building over the past two years. When Google employees staged a walkout last November, many contingent workers didn\u2019t learn about it in advance because they don\u2019t have access to internal mailing lists. A month later, Googlers sent an open letter to the company\u2019s management demanding better working conditions for temporary workers, vendors and contractors.The Apple Maps operations staffed by Apex provide a dim view of contract work, according to current and former Apex workers. Some took jobs there with the hope of landing full-time work at Apple \u2014 a possibility they said Apex played up \u2014only to find the chances were small. As Apple has faced headwinds in recent months, it has further reduced the practice of converting any contract workers to full-time positions, according to a person familiar with Apple\u2019s operations.Other Apex workers took the job just to put Apple on their resume. Even that benefit was tenuous. Apex managers initially distributed specific wording they could include on their LinkedIn profiles referring to their employer as Apple, via Apex Systems. Last summer, Apex said they had to remove the word \u201cApple,\u201d describing their employer only as \u201cA Major Tech Company Via Apex Systems,\u201d according to two former employees.The restrictions were just one of many reminders of the contractors\u2019 inferior status, right down to the apple design on their ID badges. For direct employees, the apples were multi-colored; contractors got what one described as \u201csad grey.\u201d It\u2019s common for companies to distribute different badges to contractors, a practice that discontented workers across the industry have seized on as evidence of a caste system.\u00a0Amber Lutsko, who worked for Apple through Apex in 2017 and 2018, described an opening-day pep talk that aimed to make her feel both honored and excluded. \u201c\u2018You work at Apple now! You have made it!\u2019\u201d she recalls being told. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to use the gym.\u2019\u201dThe companies of Silicon Valley have created vast fortunes with far fewer employees than the corporate behemoths that came before them. In part, this is because you can replicate software infinitely in a way you can\u2019t with, say, a Model T. But the tech industry was also an early adopter of offloading core functions to contract workers. Tech was quick\u00a0to embrace contractors because of rapid advancements requiring constant adjustments in the composition of the workforce, according to Louis Hyman, author of the 2018 book \u201cTemp.\u201d All those changes helped nurture Silicon Valley\u2019s ideology of flexibility and speed, first in hardware, then in software and business operations. Hyman quotes a 1993 issue of Apple\u2019s internal magazine that describes the transition away from direct employees to contractors and outsourcing firms as both a \u201cpredictable evolution\u201d and \u201cthe future.\u201dConflict is inevitable in a two-tiered workforce. As far back as the 1990s, Microsoft Corp. contractors challenged their employment status in court and attempted to unionize. In 2014 a group of Microsoft bug-testers won the right to bargain with their employer, a staffing agency called Lionbridge Technologies Inc. Within a few years, Lionsbridge had eliminated all their jobs.Apple, which has about 130,000 full-time employees, also accepts workers from about three dozen staffing firms, according to OnContracting, a website providing market information to staffing companies. Contracting firms work on iTunes and server infrastructure, handle customer support, and select articles for Apple News. Apex, the largest division of ASGN, a staffing company based in suburban Los Angeles, has provided Apple with a steady stream of mapping technicians, whose jobs consist of checking to make sure that Apple\u2019s software is drawing roads in the right places, or responding to reports of inaccuracies in existing maps.They\u2019re largely in their early- to mid-20s, and have often just graduated from college. Wages are generally about US$25 an hour, which some workers consider generous and others see as stingy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median hourly wage for mapping technicians nationwide was $20.84, while the median per-hour rate for the same jobs in California was $30.61.Apex employees have access to health insurance, although the premiums are high enough that some people opt not to take it. Because the workforce is young, Apex workers often stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance.The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they'd made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The 'Oh you didn't make it through training, please give us your badge now'.Apex has also suddenly changed aspects of employment. In November, it cut the maximum amount of paid sick time employees could take annually from 48 hours to 24 hours, saying the policy would go into effect in two days, according to two current employees and an internal email viewed by Bloomberg. The email, which Apex workers received on a Thursday afternoon, inspired a rare moment of collective action. A group of over a dozen workers said they had suddenly fallen ill, and left,\u00a0according to one current Apex employee who participated in the protest.\u201cAt all times, Apex has provided as much paid sick leave as required by applicable law,\u201d says Omohundro, adding that the company worked to find exceptions in individual cases.Many Apex employees first heard about the company through LinkedIn. The company trawls the website for people with proficiency in skills for mapmaking like geographic information systems or geography, then messages them repeatedly. Lutsko had worked as an archaeologist and was between jobs in 2017 when, as she describes it, she basically gave in. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty aggressive, so it was easy to take the job,\u201d she says.At the beginning of the interview process, Apex doesn\u2019t mention the company where people will work. But the revelation can tip wavering candidates over the edge. \u201cThey said it was with Apple \u2014 they were super hush-hush originally \u2014 and I was like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019,\u201d says a former Apex worker who started in 2017. \u201c\u2018That will be on my resume? Bang!\u2019\u201dThey said it was with Apple \u2014 they were super hush-hush originally \u2014 and I was like, 'Oh my God! That will be on my resume? Bang!'The secrecy just made the job seem sexier. Many Apex workers assumed discretion was required because Hammerwood had some connection to self-driving cars. Their own work turned out to be drudgery. Still, they gossiped about the mysterious group of direct Apple employees who also worked on the site. They never knew for sure what those people were up to, since they say\u00a0managers at Apex kept them from communicating with\u00a0Apple employees unless it was necessary to do their immediate jobs. One former Apex worker says the contractors weren\u2019t allowed to use the bathrooms on the direct employees\u2019 side of the building.Complaints about the bathrooms were common. Lines formed outside the men\u2019s rooms, especially around lunchtime, according to former employees. (Because the workforce was predominantly male, the women\u2019s rooms had ample capacity.) Anonymous complaints about inadequate facilities were scrawled on white boards around the office. Twice in 2017, Hammerwood workers filed complaints against Apple with the state\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA. Apple told Cal/OSHA it had examined the situation and determined it was in compliance with the law. There was no mention of Apex workers being discouraged from using certain bathrooms, according to records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request. The agency did not pursue the issue.The working environment was uncomfortable\u00a0in other ways, according to current and former contractors. Apex managers sometimes broke up unauthorized water-cooler socializing. Several workers say their managers would get notifications if their workstations were idle for too long. \u201cBeing monitored like that is super dehumanizing and terrifying,\u201d says one former Apex mapping technician.If Apex seemed not to trust its workers, the feeling was mutual. They described a hiring process that was misleading in several ways. For one, Apex failed to explain the one-year assignments started with several weeks of training followed by a test, many say. Anyone who didn\u2019t pass was terminated immediately. The company recruited nationwide, so some workers showed up in California, signed leases in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and lost their only source of income within a matter of weeks.There are no reliable numbers on how common such firings were; Omohundro says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of employees complete their assignments. But they loomed large even for those who passed the test. Lutsko says watching colleagues suddenly lose their jobs soured her on her new employer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle the arbitrariness of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThe starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they\u2019d made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The \u2018Oh you didn\u2019t make it through training, please give us your badge now.\u2019\u201dLutsko quit before her contract was up. The LinkedIn messages from Apex recruiters persisted. This was common. Two people who Apex had fired said the company periodically pitches them on jobs. \u201cYou got rid of me because of my quote-unquote performance, and every three months I get these emails,\u201d says one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting, honestly.\u201dLike any group of people in shared circumstance, workers at Hammerwood bonded. Several former contractors say it was fun to be around with people their own age, and say the odd atmosphere only made them closer. Because many of them were young, new to the area, and not making enough money to live on their own, they ended up pooling resources to rent apartments or houses nearby.Many people simply moved to similar contracting jobs with other tech firms once their positions at Apple end, so their homes ended up having a mixture of Facebook, Google and Uber contractors. Several people described the geographic information systems contracting workforce almost as if it were a resource the big tech companies shared. People who left Apple would join the GIS staff at another company and find it was staffed primarily by Apex veterans.Those who left Apple often say their lives improved. Facebook\u2019s management put signs up around campus reading \u201cContractors Are People Too,\u201d and contingent workers participated in on-campus arts and crafts activities. Google paid more than competitors and let everyone use the gym, says Nick Wilson, who worked at Apple through Apex, then worked at Facebook, and is now a contractor doing mapping work at Google.Moving between companies didn\u2019t feel like advancement, says Wilson. \u201cNone of the skills I learned at Apple could be carried over,\u201d he says, adding that his managers were indifferent to any attempts by employees to distinguish themselves. \u201cThere were many people who took initiative and made things, increased the efficiency. They weren\u2019t rewarded in any way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were people who had abandoned any hope. They\u2019d come in late, leave early, and just do nothing all day. They were treated the same as everyone else.\u201d (Both Lutsko and Wilson declined to discuss the exact nature of their jobs or the building at which they worked, citing their nondisclosure agreements.)The mood at Hammerwood dimmed late last year, after the changes in benefits and after Apex suddenly fired about two dozen people, according to two current Apex employees. One described the workplace as depressing and quiet, with everyone on edge. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of being too social because they might see that as not working hard enough,\u201d he says. \u201cApex handles all terminations in a sensitive and confidential manner,\u201d says Omohundro. \u201cThe company does not share the details of employee terminations, regardless of whether they are for cause or not for cause.\u201dActivists associated with the burgeoning labour movement in the tech industry say the contracting workforce is ripe for organization, but acknowledge it\u2019s been challenging to organize white-collar workers. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept,\u201d says Yana Calou, an organizer at Coworker.org. Information workers have been more reticent than security guards and cafeteria workers to confront tech companies because they\u2019re angling for full-time work, says Calou. \u201cI think there\u2019s the tiny idea of, \u2018I\u2019ll be the exception that squeezes through.\u2019 \u201dThat feeling eventually wears off. One former Apex worker, a 32-year-old who lives in the maid\u2019s quarters of a house with eight roommates, says years of uncertainty have left him worn out. \u201cHow are you supposed to plan for your future if your job has an expiration date?\u201d he says. He\u2019s a California native who moved to San Francisco over a decade ago, got a master\u2019s degree, and internalized Silicon Valley\u2019s brand of optimism. But that evaporated at Apple\u2019s so-called black site. \u201cIt sounds good when you say you work at Apple, but when you\u2019re not being paid the same amount, and you\u2019re not treated the same way, it gets old quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t just hire someone and give them a stake in the company.\u201d\u2014 With assistance from Josh Eidelson and Mark GurmanBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada unexpectedly gains almost 67,000 jobs as private-sector hiring hits record", "description": "A sign of strength in an economy facing several other headwinds", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-job-market-surges-on-record-private-sector-hiring", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/jobs2.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 8, 2019 11:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s job market began 2019 with an unexpected employment surge driven by jobs for youth in services and record private-sector hiring, a sign of strength in an economy facing several other headwinds.Employment increased by 66,800 in January, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. That was driven by a 99,200 gain in services, which offset falling employment in goods producing industries. The gains were almost evenly split between full-time and part-time positions.The picture is much stronger than anyone expected in an economy hit by stresses in the oil sector, weakening housing markets, volatility in global financial markets and waning consumer confidence. The report could ease some concerns about the extent of a current soft patch. Economists were forecasting only a 5,000 employment increase in January.Even with the gains, Canada\u2019s jobless rate jumped to 5.8 per cent last month, from 5.6 per cent in December. But the reason for the increase was more people looking for work \u2014 a sign of strength that could indicate the jobs market is pulling new workers into the labor force. That could give the economy more room to run without fuelling wage pressures.The labour force increased by 103,700, the biggest one-month increase since 2009. The increase was led by a 60,500 increase in the number of youth joining the jobs market. Youth \u2014 people aged 15 to 24 \u2014 also led the employment gains, with a 52,800 increase.The jump in January brought employment gains over the past 12 months to 327,200, the biggest year-over-year gain since 2017.Another positive was a shift away from self-employment. The number of people employed by the private sector jumped by 111,500, the biggest one-month gain on record in data going back to 1976. The number of self-employed fell by 60,700.Ontario, with an employment gain of 41,400, led the job surge among provinces.There continues to be some weaknesses in the numbers. Wage gains remain depressed. Average hourly wages were up 2 per cent form a year ago, with pay for permanent employees up 1.8 per cent.Alberta, which is struggling with slumping oil prices and production curbs in the sector, posted a second straight monthly decline in employment.There were also broad-based losses among goods-producing sectors, including manufacturing.Total hours worked rose 1.2 per cent in January from a year earlier, which is up from 0.9 per cent in December.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "Canadian expansion on track despite oil, trade headwinds: Morneau", "description": "'Right now, we are continuing to forecast growth this year and for the forecastable future,' Finance Minister says in Davos", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/morneau-sees-canadian-expansion-on-track-despite-headwinds", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/adavos_wef_2019.1-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 25, 2019 2:48 PM EST", "content": "Despite trade headwinds and an oil shock, Canada\u2019s economy remains on track to grow this year and in the \u201cforecastable future,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau says.Morneau, speaking in an interview Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said a November shock in Canadian crude prices is negatively impacting the nation\u2019s economy, but private sector economists continue to anticipate the expansion will continue.\u201cThere are headwinds, I don\u2019t want to dismiss that as a challenge, but we do still see a period of growth,\u201d Morneau told Bloomberg TV\u2019s Francine Lacqua and Tom Keene in Davos. \u201cRight now, we are continuing to forecast growth this year and for the forecastable future.\u201dMorneau is preparing Canada\u2019s annual budget, which will serve as a de facto campaign document for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government as it aims for a second mandate in this fall\u2019s election.

Canada\u2019s ratio of household debt to income has been hovering at about 175 per cent for the past two years, compared with a peak of about 134 per cent in the U.S. at the height of its housing bubble in 2007.Now Canada\u2019s housing market is beginning to cool. Sales plunged 32 per cent in Vancouver last year and 16 per cent in Toronto amid rising interest rates, stricter mortgage rules and new taxes.\u201cChina is in the process of reversing its key role as a driver of global economic growth,\u201d the 29-year-old Costa said. \u201cCountries like Canada and Australia, and their respective housing markets, are the economies most vulnerable in this scenario.\u201dMeanwhile, Crescat calculates that about 80 per cent of Canadian non-financial stocks have been cash-flow negative in the past 12 months, which he measures as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.That may be inflated by the the large numbers of \u201czombie\u201d companies on Canadian stock exchanges, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines as those 10 years and older and whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to cover interest payments on their debts. In a September study, Deloitte found 16 per cent of public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its sister Venture Exchange are considered zombies, compared with 10 per cent globally.Cash flow in the energy sector may have been hammered by a slump in crude prices in the past year.But Costa said even if he excludes energy and materials stocks, 70 per cent of Canadian stocks have still lost money on a free cash-flow basis. If you consider only non-financial stocks with a market value of more than $100 million, the share is still more than 50 per cent, he said.\u201cHow is it sustainable for companies that generate no cash to continue to employ people?\u201d Costa said. \u201cMany of these troubled companies would be bankrupt under tighter monetary conditions.\u201dThe country\u2019s biggest lenders could face troubles on both the housing and corporate fronts, according to Costa.At their peak last year, the six largest banks, traded at an average of 1.9 times book value, a similar valuation to U.S. banks prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, according to Costa. He expects that to drop to 0.7 times book value or so, where U.S. banks were trading post-financial crisis.Other investors have recommended shorting Canadian financials on a looming housing correction in the past, including Steve Eisman, who predicted the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse.And Canadians bank stocks have largely defied naysayers as the country\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered near records lows amid steady growth \u2014 until recently. The S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks Index slumped 11 per cent last year amid market global volatility, the biggest decline since 2008.\u201cMost of these banks are off their highs and have just started to break down,\u201d Costa said.With assistance from Doug Alexander and Brandon Kochkodin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert", "title": "'Uncharted waters': Wall Street grows antsy as shutdown threat to stocks intensifies", "description": "Though U.S. equities have historically done well after shutdowns, this one 'has lasted an unprecedented amount of time with no end in sight'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/uncharted-waters-wall-street-grows-antsy-as-shutdown-threat-to-stocks-intensifies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/afinancial_markets_wall_street.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 17, 2019 4:03 PM EST", "content": "A growing group of analysts and investors is warning that the U.S. government shutdown could soon hurt stocks.Already confronting an increase in volatility, an uncertain outlook for interest rates and a trade war that threatens to damp global growth, traders now have to factor in the economic effects of the partial closure, in its record 27th day.\u201cThe impact can become meaningful as the shutdown continues,\u201d said Max Gokhman, the head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors. \u201cThe longer we go, the more we delve into uncharted waters and, as we all know, this market hates uncertainty.\u201dThere are already some nascent signs of market impact from the shutdown, with an index of airline shares underperforming broader gauges amid concerns that slowdowns in airport screenings will hurt demand for tickets. But pessimists fear the impact could become more widespread as federal workers miss out on paycheques, government bureaucracy slows and the effects trickle out to the broader economy. Terry Haines, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of political analysis, cited research in a note Thursday that found the shutdown could reduce quarterly economic growth anywhere from 0.5 to 2 percentage points.For all the hand-wringing, the overall market impact has been limited so far. The S&P 500 Index has gained 8.6 per cent since the day before the closure. Furthermore, U.S. equities have historically fared well after shutdowns, demonstrating the negative economic impact isn\u2019t usually enough to derail a market rally on its own, according to an LPL Financial Research note Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize, however, that the current shutdown has lasted for an unprecedented amount of time with no end in sight,\u201d the note said.The longer we go, the more we delve into uncharted waters and, as we all know, this market hates uncertainty.Analysts are bumping up their estimates for just how long this shutdown will last. There\u2019s a 40 per cent chance the political stalemate will extend into February as President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi show no signs of softening their resolve, according to Haines. He previously predicted it would \u201cvery likely\u201d be resolved by the end of January.\u201cThis is incrementally market negative because a longer shutdown could begin both to have real economic impact and to negatively affect market sentiment,\u201d Haines wrote.The latest sign of potential trouble came in the Labor Department\u2019s most recent jobs data. While filings for unemployment benefits fell to a five-week low, data showed that initial filings by federal employees jumped to 10,454 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Jan. 5, double the level in the week ended Dec. 29 and 10 times the amount reported in the week ended Dec. 22.\u201cEvery day, I believe, investors begin to get a little more insight into the implications of a partial shutdown,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd. \u201cWe could see it show up in diminished air travel and a whole host of other areas that may not have even been considered just a few weeks ago as potential victims of the shutdown.\u201d\u2014 With assistance from Sarah Ponczek.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Canada's commercial property market is set for another blockbuster year", "description": "'The next wave of investment is not a matter of if or when \u2014 it's just a matter of price'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/canadas-commercial-property-market-is-set-for-another-blockbuster-year", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/vancouver-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 15, 2019 2:52 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s commercial-property boom is expected to stretch into this year, helped by a tight supply and the lowest unemployment rate in at least four decades, according to brokerage Avison Young Canada Inc.\u201cWe continue to feel very positive about opportunities in the real estate environment for the year ahead,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Rose said in a report Tuesday. \u201cMore capital is available to move into real estate debt and equity than at any other time. The next wave of investment is not a matter of if or when \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of price.\u201dFinal figures for 2018 are expected to show that commercial-property investment in the country reached a record, beating the previous high of $36 billion (US$27 billion) in the year before, according to the Toronto-based brokerage. Here are highlights from the report:Vacancies declined in almost every market, lowering the Canadian average to 11 per cent at the end of last year. Office space under construction nearly doubled in 2018 to more than 22 million square feet (2 million square metres), mainly in Toronto and Vancouver. The new supply is expected to push up the vacancy rate to 11.3 per cent this year. Limited space and rising rents in downtown markets across the country could push tenants out to the suburbs.Vacancies nationwide fell to a record low of 2.9 per cent near the end of 2018 and are expected to drop further this year. Toronto and Vancouver had the lowest industrial vacancy rates in North America at 1.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. The cities are projected to rank among the three tightest markets in the continent this year. Construction rose to more than 20 million square feet last year, up from about 14 million square feet in 2017.Vacancies remain in flux due to closures of big chains and the rise of online shopping. Luxury and discount retailers are flourishing at the expense of the middle of the market. Growth in spending is slowing amid high consumer debt and rising interest rates.

Like \u201cNew Barrick,\u201d which no longer has its top executives in Canada, Newmont Goldcorp\u2019s incoming chief executive officer and current chairwoman are expected to remain in the U.S. While some jobs will flow from Nevada to the miner\u2019s new regional base for North America in Vancouver, it\u2019s hard to imagine the influence of that city not waning as a result of the deal.\u201cAnytime you lose a head office, I think that\u2019s probably a negative but we know the Newmont senior team well, they\u2019re smart people, they\u2019ve built a good business, a big part of Goldcorp\u2019s business is their Canadian production,\u201d said Sean Boyd, chief executive officer of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., a Toronto-based gold miner.Typically, foreign takeovers of Canadian companies have bled strategic vision, high-paying jobs, management expertise and a host of ancillary services from finance and human resources to accounting. Like Falconbridge Ltd., Inco Ltd, and Alcan before, this latest deal in the mining sector will see Goldcorp\u2019s Canadian head office disappear.Newmont tried to mitigate that reality by saying the merger will ensure Canada\u2019s gold industry will participate in a \u201cworld-leading natural resources company,\u201d with a \u201csignificant\u201d Canadian presence on the board.The deal comes as the \u201chollowing out\u201d debate has been resurrected in Canada. Barrick\u2019s move to shift jobs away from Canada has intensified since the Randgold merger was announced; its current Toronto headcount is down to just 60 to 70 employees on one floor of a Bay Street office tower. The gold miner, founded by the late Peter Munk in Toronto in the 1980s, has just one Canadian director.Earlier this month, former Newmont vice chairman Pierre Lassonde was quoted in Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail saying Munk would be rolling over in his grave at the turn of events. At a Canadian Mining Hall of Fame dinner last week, he opened his remarks with a jab at the single Barrick table, suggesting anyone in the audience wanting to meet Barrick employees should do it fast as they could be gone before the end of dinner.Yet as Canada\u2019s once-mighty resource industries shrink \u2014 the energy sector is seeing its own share of pain \u2014 the economy has hardly been hurting. Growth was a Group-of-Seven-leading 3 pe rcent in 2017. And while economists see that slowing to 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 1.9 per cent in 2019, job growth remains solid with the unemployment rate at a four-decades low of 5.6 per cent in December.Much of the country\u2019s growth has been driven by consumption \u2014 largely housing \u2014 which is now fading too but new industries are also rising \u2014 technology in particular. Toronto alone created more tech jobs than the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington, D.C., combined last year, while leapfrogging New York in a ranking of \u201ctalent markets,\u201d according to CBRE Group Inc.Global giants including Microsoft Corp., Google, and Amazon.com Inc. are generating thousands of new jobs while home grown stars such as Shopify Inc. expand. Meanwhile, Toronto\u2019s financial services sector has become the second-largest in North America. Four of North America\u2019s top 10 banks based on assets are now Canadian.\u2013With assistance from Natalie Wong.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Keith Naughton, David Welch and Gabrielle Coppola", "title": "Sorry Detroit, the next North American car recession has already started", "description": "And this time, the motor city may have trouble\u00a0finding friends in Washington", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/the-next-american-car-recession-has-already-started", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/detroit.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 14, 2019 2:36 PM EST", "content": "These should be boom times for Detroit.\u00a0Unemployment is at a half-century low, gasoline is cheap\u00a0and auto sales in the U.S. were near\u00a0record levels\u00a0last year. Yet American automakers are\u00a0closing\u00a0factories, cutting\u00a0 shifts\u00a0and\u00a0laying off\u00a0thousands\u00a0of workers. The industry is\u00a0behaving like a recession has arrived.In one segment of the market,\u00a0it has.Detroit is in the grips of a car recession marked by the\u00a0collapse\u00a0of demand for traditional sedans, which\u00a0accounted for half the market just six years ago. Buyers have made a mass exodus out of classic family cars and into sport utility vehicles. Familiar sedan models such as the Honda Accord and\u00a0the Ford Fusion made up a record low\u00a030 per cent of U.S. sales in 2018, and things will only get worse.It feels like we're going back to that dark period a decade agoSales of the passenger-car body style that\u2019s dominated the industry since the Model T will sink to 21.5 per cent of the U.S. market by 2025, according to researchers at LMC Automotive, relegating sedans to fringe products. That leaves automakers with excess factory capacity that can turn out about 3 million more vehicles\u00a0than buyers want. And overcapacity is precisely what spurred losses the last time a recession wracked the industry.\u201cYou could classify this as a car recession,\u201d said\u00a0Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive.It\u2019s a situation that promises to put a damper on the\u00a0North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week, the last to be held in the chill of January. In a bid to reestablish\u00a0relevance, the annual car conclave is moving to June next year and will be reimagined as a chance for show-goers to drive new models in warm weather. The car dealers who organize the show hope the new format will entice notable dropouts \u2014 a group that now includes\u00a0Mercedes, BMW and Audi \u2014 to return to an event that once commanded the full attention of the automotive\u00a0world.An optimist might seek solace in the better-than-expected profit prediction issued\u00a0Friday by\u00a0General Motors Co. But a deeper look at the numbers reveals that the biggest contribution to the company\u2019s\u00a0rosy forecast were cost-cutting\u00a0plans \u2014 including closing\u00a0five North American plants \u2014 which it said will help boost profit this year by as much as US$2.5 billion.America\u2019s auto industry has 10 plants and 20,000 workers more than it needsThe overcapacity plaguing U.S. automakers is the equivalent of 10 excess plants, which would account for at least 20,000 jobs directly, and thousands more as it ripples through the suppliers and support services to the massive industry.\u00a0\u201cGM has taken some actions, but they still have some well-underutilized plants,\u201d Schuster said. \u201cSo we may not be done with this yet.\u201dOne strategy for dealing with the collapsing car market in the past has been to\u00a0stuff unwanted\u00a0sedans into rental lots and other commercial fleets. That has only delayed today\u2019s capacity crisis. Those lower-profit fleet sales have inflated the market, keeping U.S. vehicle deliveries above 17 million for the last four years, even as sales to individual retail customers peaked three years ago.\u201cThe car recession and the retail recession have already arrived in the sense that retail sales peaked in 2015 and have gone down ever since,\u201d said\u00a0Mark Wakefield, head of the automotive practice at consultant AlixPartners. \u201cCars have just been crushed.\u201dMany former passenger-car buyers have flocked to crossover SUVs that offer more room and, these days,\u00a0competitive fuel economy. The\u00a0Chevy Malibu, a family sedan, gets combined city and highway fuel economy of 26 miles per gallon. The\u00a0Chevy Equinox, a small crossover SUV, trails by only one mile per gallon.There are signs drivers are even ditching sedans for big trucks. \u201cPickup buyers are trading in crossover SUVs and sedans,\u201d said\u00a0Sandor Piszar, director of marketing at Chevrolet,\u00a0which is ramping up production of\u00a0its new Silverado. Total U.S. pickup sales\u00a0grew 2 percent last year, to 2.4 million vehicles, in a market that was otherwise flat.Outside Detroit, auto executives are sticking with sedans. Between the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, Toyota sells 375,000 of its Corolla compacts each\u00a0year. The Camry sedan likewise moves in big, albeit shrinking, numbers. \u201cWe are not going to get out of that business,\u201d\u00a0Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor North America, said in an interview last month. \u201cWe still see an opportunity there.\u201dIronically, automakers have the last recession to blame for their current plight. A decade ago, when\u00a0high gas prices and a crashing economy left little demand for\u00a0SUVs, the auto industry suffered through\u00a0layoffs, plant closings and, ultimately, the bankruptcies and bailouts of\u00a0GM and\u00a0Chrysler. Detroit\u00a0flipped\u00a0its factories from making hulking SUVs to sensible, gas-sipping sedans.Much of Detroit is once again building too many of the wrong products\u201cYou had two quick, upward movements in gas prices in the 2000s that were like a one-two punch,\u201d\u00a0said Wakefield,\u00a0\u201cand it was like a dog whistle went off, and you couldn\u2019t sell\u201d SUVs. His firm helped guide GM through its 2009 bankruptcy.\u00a0\u201cIt felt like gas prices would go up and stay high,\u201d he recalled.But now the market has flipped back, thanks to consistently low\u00a0gas prices, and much of Detroit\u00a0is once again building too many of the wrong products.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which anticipated sedans\u2019 death spiral by culling its car lineup in 2016, has largely sidestepped the restructuring pain GM and Ford are experiencing now. Instead of shuttering plants or cutting shifts, it\u2019s\u00a0 converting\u00a0an engine factory\u00a0in Detroit to make room for a three-row Jeep Grand Cherokee and tying its fortunes to an onslaught of SUVs. The Jeep Gladiator, a\u00a0truck version of the Wrangler, is due out in the second quarter of 2019. A retooled plant in\u00a0Warren, Michigan, will produce the\u00a0revived Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs.Unlike last time it ran into trouble, Detroit may have trouble\u00a0finding friends in Washington or at the United Auto Workers\u00a0to help them get through this tough transition. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0has gone on the\u00a0attack, taking GM chief executive Mary Barra\u00a0to task for her decision to close four U.S. plants. Even allies like Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, a former GM executive, said last month that GM had made itself \u201cthe most thoroughly disliked company in Washington.\u201dThe UAW has sued GM over its plant closings and is\u00a0girding\u00a0for a big fight at the bargaining table this year as it negotiates new contracts with U.S. automakers that have begun behaving like the good times are already in the rear-view mirror.\u201cIt\u2019s a very bizarre environment right now\u00a0because the general economic conditions are still quite favorable,\u201d Schuster said. \u201cBut it feels like we\u2019re going back to that\u201d dark period a decade ago.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jonathan Roeder", "title": "Lululemon shares gain after boosting quarterly sales, profit forecast", "description": "Lululemon's preliminary data suggests it will sidestep the rout that derailed some companies' shares last week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/lululemon-gains-after-boosting-quarterly-sales-profit-forecast", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lululemon.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 14, 2019 9:57 AM EST", "content": "Investors are happy about at least one retailer\u2019s holiday season: Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. jumped in early trading Monday after the yogawear company increased its fourth-quarter guidance for sales and profit.Lululemon said comparable-store sales, a key gauge of retail success, increased in the high-single to low-double digits for the current quarter, which ends Feb. 3.

Markets are less sanguine, focusing more on the deteriorating global economic outlook and trade risks between the U.S. and China. Swaps trading suggests investors believe the Bank of Canada\u2019s normalization may already have come to an end, after five hikes since the middle of 2017.\u201cThe pendulum in the market often swings more than the underlying facts on the ground,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re still expecting a hike or two in 2019,\u201d though \u201cit\u2019s going to really depend on what sort of recovery we get in oil prices and when we get it.\u201dAll but one of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep its benchmark rate at 1.75 per cent in a decision at 10 a.m. in Ottawa. Markets are pricing in zero chance of an increase. The Bank of Canada will also release its quarterly economic forecasts Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Governor Stephen Poloz.What\u2019s certain is the Bank of Canada will need to revise down its projections for growth, at least for this year, thanks to weaker oil prices and transport bottlenecks that have prompted the Alberta government to implement temporary production cuts. In its October forecasts, the central bank estimated growth of 2.1 per cent in 2019 \u2014 which now looks on the high side.Economists see Canadian growth sliding closer to 1 per cent on an annualized basis for a few months, before bouncing back once Alberta\u2019s output cuts are lifted. After that, the pace of the expansion should return to near its recent trend of 2 per cent for the rest of the year.Recent data have been promising. Canada\u2019s economy continues to produce enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate at historic lows, and businesses remain upbeat about investment and hiring plans. Even oil prices have shown a bit of a comeback in recent days, giving a lift to the Canadian dollar to start the year.\u201cWe have entered a slow patch, but the economy is on solid footing,\u201d said Josh Nye, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, which is expecting the central bank to increase rates twice this year.Still, there\u2019s enough concern to curb the central bank\u2019s enthusiasm for higher rates and even in the best case Poloz is probably already near the end of his hiking cycle. For one, signs have begun to emerge that higher interest rates are slowing consumption and the housing market. There is also new evidence suggesting the economy had more slack in recent years than previously thought.Plus, with markets also pricing in a rate pause from the Federal Reserve, the Canadian central bank may be reluctant to press ahead with higher interest rates for fear of driving up the country\u2019s currency.But Poloz isn\u2019t sounding like someone who has given up on rate increases. The central banker told CTV News last month that interest rates should eventually move toward a neutral range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 per cent given the economy is operating near capacity, unemployment is at four-decade lows, and inflation is at the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target.\u201cGetting there, it\u2019s a journey and we expect over time to get there. But it can be interrupted or it could be sped up, depending on how the economic data evolve,\u201d Poloz said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Prashant Gopal", "title": "The housing bear who predicted the 2008 slowdown says\u00a0the worst is yet to come", "description": "'Homebuyers have woken up to the fact that affordability is a major issue,' James Stack says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-bear-who-called-2018-slowdown-says-worst-yet-to-come?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 7, 2019 1:55 PM EST", "content": "James Stack, who predicted the 2008 real estate crash and nailed last year\u2019s housing slowdown with uncanny timing, is back with some bad news for 2019.\u201cHousing could be heading for its worst year since the last housing crash,\u201d Stack, 67, said in a phone interview. \u201cExpect home sales to continue on a downward trend in the next 12-plus months. And there\u2019s a significant downside risk to housing prices if a recession takes hold.\u201dLast January, Stack was practically alone when he warned rising mortgage rates would expose housing\u2019s affordability problem and \u201cthe risk that today\u2019s highly inflated housing market will again end badly.\u201d The day after Bloomberg published his comments on Jan. 22, homebuilder shares began a 10-day slide, and ended the year down by more than a third.Almost a year later, the signs of coming distress in property markets \u2014 and the broader economy\u00a0 are only increasing, said Stack. Home purchase contracts in the U.S. fell 7.7 per cent in November, according to a National Association of Realtors index. Consumer confidence dropped in December. And a gauge of U.S. manufacturing plunged by the most since 2008, only a day after Apple cut its sales outlook, prompting investor worries about a global growth slowdown.Stack, who manages US$1.3 billion for people with a high net worth from his office in Whitefish, Montana, studies his fireproof files of newspaper articles on bear markets dating back to 1929. He predicted the housing crash in 2005, just before prices reached their peak. Last year\u2019s warning came after Stack noticed that his \u201cHousing Bubble Bellwether Barometer\u201d of homebuilder and mortgage stocks was up 80 per cent in a year, a sign that investors once again had gotten too \u201cexuberant.\u201dHe says it\u2019s too early to know if housing is in another bubble. It will depend on what happens with the economy. \u201cUnfortunately, bubbles are only recognized with 100 per cent certainty in 20/20 hindsight,\u201d he says.To be sure, economic strength should be playing to housing\u2019s benefit. While rates for 30-year mortgages peaked at 4.94 per cent in November, climbing a percentage point since the start of 2018, they\u2019ve since fallen to 4.51 per cent. And the U.S. unemployment rate is near a five-decade low, with employers in December adding the most workers in 10 months.But Stack says the damage is done.\u201cEven if mortgage rates level off or ease slightly in 2019, we are unlikely to see the psychology turnaround,\u201d Stack said. \u201cHomebuyers have woken up to the fact that affordability is a major issue.

For one thing, labour force demographics were a drag on economic growth last time, but they should help minimize economic weakness this time.The key factor when thinking about the interaction between labour force demographics and the economic cycle is the role played by the baby boomer generation \u2014 because of their sheer numbers. The population bulge of people born\u00a0between the early 1940s and the early 1960s\u00a0is visible both in population data and in the labour force data. Because people tend to act differently at different phases of life, as the boomers have passed through their working years they have distorted the economy.Baby boomers acted as a drag on the economy in the aftermath of the great recession because it occurred during the peak saving years of the generation. Saving rates tend to be\u00a0higher for older workers\u00a0because older workers have higher incomes than younger workers do, they\u2019re more focused on saving for their approaching retirements than younger workers, and because the bulk of their spending on raising families may be behind them. When the bulk of the growth of the labour market is occurring because more older workers are working longer, as it has been for the past decade, this acts as a relative drag on economic growth overall because these older workers are saving for retirement rather than demand-generating activities like buying houses and raising families.After the great recession, some referred to the 2000s as a lost decade for employment because there was very little net job growth during that decade.\u00a0For younger workers \u2014 those under say age 55 \u2014 things have been much bleaker: From April 2000 until today there has been essentially no net growth of employment for workers under age 55. Over that same time, employment for workers over age 55 has doubled. That\u2019s how much of an impact the aging of the baby boomer generation has had.But this is about to change. Perhaps as soon as this year, employment of people over the age of 55 should peak, after which it would decline for the next 15 years. We know this because the same pattern has played out for every other age bracket that baby boomers have passed through.The pattern has been 23 years of growth for an age bracket followed by 15 years of decline. This accounts for the size of the baby boomer generation (23 years) followed by a 15 year lull until births began to pick up in the late 1970s. The age 25 to 34 labour force\u00a0grew from 1966 through 1989 then declined for about 15 years. The age 35 to 44 labour force grew from 1974 to 1997 then declined for about 15 years. For age 45 to 54 the growth period was from 1984 to 2007. And for age 55-plus the growth wave began in 1996.This matters because a mild labour market downturn, or a multi-year period without much net job growth, may not feel like much of a downturn at all if it\u2019s happening during a time when the number of older workers is shrinking. As Bill McBride of\u00a0Calculated Risk has pointed out, in 2020 the three largest age cohorts of Americans are going to be 25 through 29, 30 through 34, and 35 through 39. These are the consumption-intensive family formation years. Older workers retiring, with those jobs, promotions, and raises being taken by younger workers, could act as a stimulus and keep any downturn mild and short.There are a variety of reasons the economy may have disappointed Americans since the year 2000, from bubbles to policy errors to debt overhangs. But to the extent that demographics and an aging workforce have contributed, the future is looking bright.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada ends decent year for jobs with December slowdown", "description": "Even so jobless rate holds at lowest in more than four decades", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-ends-decent-year-for-jobs-with-december-slowdown", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/0503subway.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 4, 2019 9:11 AM EST", "content": "Canada employers capped another decent year of hiring by taking a breather in December.Employment eked out a small gain of 9,300 for the month, but the increase was driven by part-time work and self-employed workers, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa.

U.S. stocks fell back toward their session lows after Trump\u2019s outburst, with the S&P 500 Index on track to close at a 19-month low.The president\u2019s Twitter post didn\u2019t mention Powell, a Trump nominee who has overseen four rate hikes this year to prevent the economy from overheating.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sought to reassure investors over the weekend that Powell\u2019s job is safe.

Bush.While Fed rate hikes have contributed to equity declines and a softer housing market, the American economy is being buffeted by a few factors owing to the Trump administration and Congress.Trump\u2019s trade war with China is creating uncertainty for businesses. U.S. government debt is approaching US$22 trillion. A federal shutdown this week is raising concerns about Washington\u2019s ability to find bipartisan solutions to pressing problems.Recent data show economic growth is holding up fairly well but may moderate heading into next year. The labour market is solid and unemployment at 3.7 per cent is the lowest since 1969. One measure of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in December as views on economic conditions improved, helping bolster the outlook for American spending.Gross domestic product is seen expanding 2.9 per cent this year, buoyed by tax cuts and higher federal spending signed by Trump, but the pace is expected to slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus fades. The White House argues lower corporate taxes will boost productivity and help the economy grow faster without causing inflation, and therefore the Fed doesn\u2019t need to tighten policy.The turmoil engulfing Washington \u2014 and the financial market rout that\u2019s happening in response \u2014 widened after Bloomberg News, late Friday, reported Trump\u2019s discussion about firing Powell. Mnuchin said in a pair of tweets Saturday evening that he\u2019d spoken with the president about the matter, and he quoted Trump saying he didn\u2019t believe he had the authority to remove the central bank chief.Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s pick for the next White House chief of staff, said Sunday he\u2019d spoken to Mnuchin and that Trump \u201cnow realizes he does not have the ability\u201d to fire a Fed chairman.Trump has yet to publicly affirm that belief himself.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "The verdict is in: Canada's 2015 downturn amid shock oil collapse wasn't a recession", "description": "'It was an extremely close vote,' but C.D.

The review was undertaken to account for Statistics Canada data revisions last month that showed the impact of the oil-price collapse that year was larger than previously estimated.The council stuck to its initial assessment because the downturn \u2014 which included two consecutive quarterly contractions in output \u2014 wasn\u2019t broad enough and the economy continued to add jobs.\u201cIt was an extremely close vote in the end,\u201d Jeremy Kronick, associate director for research at C.D.

Officials had a median projection of one move in 2020.Following the decision, stocks erased gains, 10-year Treasury yields fell and the dollar bounced off its lows of the day. Investors may have been swayed by the Fed\u2019s generally upbeat analysis and expectation of more rate increases than markets anticipate.Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at a press conference after the decision on Wednesday, stressed that policy was not on a preset course.\u201cThere\u2019s significant uncertainty about the \u2014 both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cInflation has still remained just a touch below two per cent. So I do think that gives the committee the ability to be patient in moving forward.\u201dPowell and his colleagues said \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a strong rate,\u2019\u2019 according to a statement following the two-day meeting in Washington. While officials said risks to their outlook \u201care roughly balanced,\u201d they flagged threats from a softening world economy.The Federal Open Market Committee \u201cwill continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook,\u201d the statement said. The 10-0 decision lifted the federal funds rate target to a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.The quarter-point hike came after Trump assailed the Fed on Twitter for two straight days, urging it to hold rates steady in the most public assault on its political independence in decades. Investors are also fretting over the economy, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly in recent weeks.Answering questions during the press conference, Powell said political considerations play no role in Fed policy making. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our jobs the way we\u2019ve always done them,\u201d he said when asked about White House pressure. The Fed will do its analysis and \u201cnothing will cause us to deviate from that,\u201d he added.Officials also altered key language in their statement, saying the FOMC \u201cjudges that some further gradual increases\u201d in rates will likely be needed, a shift from previous language saying the FOMC \u201cexpects that further gradual increases\u201d would be required. In addition, the median estimate among policy makers for the so- called neutral rate in the long run fell to 2.75 per cent, from 3 per cent in the previous forecasts from September. The median projection is for the benchmark rate to end 2021 at 3.1 per cent, down from a prior estimate of 3.4 per cent.Those are more acknowledgments that rates are moving closer to the point where policy makers will at least take a break from the quarterly procession of hikes they pursued throughout 2018.When taken together, the latest quarter-point move, language changes and shift in rate projections indicate continued confidence in the economy, yet also greater caution over how far and fast the Fed expects to move with future hikes. As Powell has said, the Fed is now feeling its way forward and will act in line with how the economy performs.Investors have had a more pessimistic view than the Fed, foreseeing one increase at most in 2019, according to interest- rate futures prices.In a related move, the Fed lifted the interest rate it pays on bank reserves deposited at the central bank by just 20 basis points, instead of the usual 25 basis points that would match the quarter-point increase for the fed funds target range. As with a similar move in June, the action was aimed at containing the effective fed funds rate inside the target range.He\u2019ll be aiming to strike a careful balance, expressing a still-positive view on the U.S. economy without telegraphing a policy outlook that investors might view as too aggressive for an economy that appears somewhat more fragile than just a few months ago.While job creation has slowed slightly, over the past several months it has still easily outstripped the number needed to accommodate population growth. Unemployment in November remained at 3.7 per cent, its lowest since 1969. That has helped lift wages but hasn\u2019t provoked any serious signs of excessive inflation.Still, many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 and into 2020, and the Fed\u2019s median estimate for gross domestic product expansion in 2019 fell to 2.3 per cent from 2.5 per cent.Previous hikes and a stronger dollar will gradually bite into the economy just as fiscal stimulus fades and foreign economies from China to Europe also cool. Meanwhile, the ongoing trade dispute with China and a potentially chaotic exit for the U.K. from the European Union represent significant additional risks.Financial markets have been turbulent for weeks, with the S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks dropping 13 per cent from the end of September through Tuesday.

Don\u2019t sit next to them on flights. Book hotel rooms on different floors. Avoid one-on-one meetings.In fact, as a wealth adviser put it, just hiring a woman these days is \u201can unknown risk.\u201d What if she took something he said the wrong way?Across Wall Street, men are adopting controversial strategies for the #MeToo era and, in the process, making life even harder for women.Call it the Pence Effect, after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he avoids dining alone with any woman other than his wife. In finance, the overarching impact can be, in essence, gender segregation.Interviews with more than 30 senior executives suggest many are spooked by #MeToo and struggling to cope. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a sense of walking on eggshells,\u201d said David Bahnsen, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley who\u2019s now an independent adviser overseeing more than US$1.5 billion.This is hardly a single-industry phenomenon, as men across the country check their behaviour at work, to protect themselves in the face of what they consider unreasonable political correctness \u2014 or to simply do the right thing. The upshot is forceful on Wall Street, where women are scarce in the upper ranks. The industry has also long nurtured a culture that keeps harassment complaints out of the courts and public eye, and has so far avoided a mega-scandal like the one that has engulfed Harvey Weinstein.Now, more than a year into the #MeToo movement \u2014 with its devastating revelations of harassment and abuse in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond \u2014 Wall Street risks becoming more of a boy\u2019s club, rather than less of one.\u201cWomen are grasping for ideas on how to deal with it, because it is affecting our careers,\u201d said Karen Elinski, president of the Financial Women\u2019s Association and a senior vice president at Wells Fargo & Co. \u201cIt\u2019s a real loss.\u201dWomen are grasping for ideas on how to deal with it, because it is affecting our careersThere\u2019s a danger, too, for companies that fail to squash the isolating backlash and don\u2019t take steps to have top managers be open about the issue and make it safe for everyone to discuss it, said Stephen Zweig, an employment attorney with FordHarrison.\u201cIf men avoid working or traveling with women alone, or stop mentoring women for fear of being accused of sexual harassment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose men are going to back out of a sexual harassment complaint and right into a sex discrimination complaint.\u201dWhile the new personal codes for dealing with #MeToo have only just begun to ripple, the shift is already palpable, according to the people interviewed, who declined to be named. They work for hedge funds, law firms, banks, private equity firms and investment-management firms.For obvious reasons, few will talk openly about the issue. Privately, though, many of the men interviewed acknowledged they\u2019re channeling Pence, saying how uneasy they are about being alone with female colleagues, particularly youthful or attractive ones, fearful of the rumour mill or of, as one put it, the potential liability.A manager in infrastructure investing said he won\u2019t meet with female employees in rooms without windows anymore; he also keeps his distance in elevators. A late-40-something in private equity said he has a new rule, established on the advice of his wife, an attorney: no business dinner with a woman 35 or younger.The changes can be subtle but insidious, with a woman, say, excluded from casual after-work drinks, leaving male colleagues to bond, or having what should be a private meeting with a boss with the door left wide open.On Wall Street as elsewhere, reactions to #MeToo can smack of paranoia, particularly given the industry\u2019s history of protecting its biggest revenue generators.\u201cSome men have voiced concerns to me that a false accusation is what they fear,\u201d said Zweig, the lawyer. \u201cThese men fear what they cannot control.\u201dThere are as many or more men who are responding in quite different ways. One, an investment adviser who manages about 100 employees, said he briefly reconsidered having one-on-one meetings with junior women. He thought about leaving his office door open, or inviting a third person into the room.Finally, he landed on the solution: \u201cJust try not to be an asshole.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much the bottom line, said Ron Biscardi, chief executive officer of Context Capital Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s really not that hard.\u201dJust try not to be an assholeIn January, as #MeToo was gathering momentum, Biscardi did away with the late-night, open-bar gathering he\u2019d hosted for years in his penthouse suite during Context Capital\u2019s annual conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. \u201cGiven the fact that women are in the minority at our events, we want to make sure that the environment is always welcoming and comfortable. We felt that eliminating the after-party was necessary to remain consistent with that goal.\u201dIn this charged environment, the question is how the response to #MeToo might actually end up hurting women\u2019s progress. Given the male dominance in Wall Street\u2019s top jobs, one of the most pressing consequences for women is the loss of male mentors who can help them climb the ladder.\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough women in senior positions to bring along the next generation all by themselves,\u201d said Lisa Kaufman, chief executive officer of LaSalle Securities. \u201cAdvancement typically requires that someone at a senior level knows your work, gives you opportunities and is willing to champion you within the firm. It\u2019s hard for a relationship like that to develop if the senior person is unwilling to spend one-on-one time with a more junior person.\u201dMen have to step up, she said, and \u201cnot let fear be a barrier.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Max Abelson and Sonali Basak.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Exploding demand for pot fuelling a jobs boom that has Canadian firms importing workers to keep up", "description": "Job openings in the cannabis industry have tripled in the past year and are expected to spike even more as edibles become legal", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/pot-is-so-hot-in-canada-that-firms-are-importing-workers", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/cannabis-worker.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 3, 2018 9:55 AM EST", "content": "It was mid-summer, less than three months before Canada legalized recreational marijuana, and Vic Neufeld had a problem.The chief executive officer of Aphria Inc. had just hired 50 people to work in the pot producer\u2019s greenhouse in Leamington, Ontario and by the end of the first week all but eight had quit.\u201cThose are really hot, humid months and working in a greenhouse, as much cooling and airflow as we can provide, is still pretty darn hot in July and August,\u201d Neufeld said in a phone interview.A lack of qualified local labour forced Aphria to dispose of almost 14,000 cannabis plants in the quarter ended Aug. 31 after they weren\u2019t harvested in time, costing it nearly $1 million (US$750,000). Since then, the company has doubled the staff at its Aphria One greenhouse thanks in part to Canada\u2019s Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program, which has allowed it to hire about 50 temporary workers from the Caribbean and Guatemala with plans to bring in up to 100 more.Aphria\u2019s experience underscores the swelling demand for labour in Canada\u2019s five-year-old cannabis sector, where openings have tripled in the past year to 34 out of every 10,000 job postings, according to employment search engine Indeed.com.Canada\u2019s licensed producers employed about 2,400 workers at the end of 2017, according to Statistics Canada, and BMO Capital Markets estimated that industry employment was around 3,500 people when legalization took effect in mid-October.Between them, eight of Canada\u2019s largest cannabis companies are now actively recruiting for approximately 1,700 positions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Many companies say they expect that number to grow as they expand production facilities after Canada legalized recreational marijuana in October.There\u2019s been a spike in postings for jobs at cannabis growers and retailers. And next year will see even more demand for labour as Canada expands the number of legal cannabis products to include edibles and concentrates, said Alison McMahon, founder and CEO of Cannabis At Work, a recruitment and training site.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of R&D positions and a lot of science-based positions around extraction and formulations,\u201d McMahon said, estimating that the industry could create around 125,000 jobs in the first year after legalization.Increasing automation will also likely accelerate the shift toward more high-tech jobs in the industry away from more manual jobs. That would follow the pattern of traditional sectors such as the auto industry, where blue-collar manufacturing jobs have been disappearing as companies ramp up spending on research and engineering.Canopy Growth Corp., Canada\u2019s largest licensed producer by market value, needs to fill about 1,200 positions. Recent postings on the company\u2019s recruitment site range from a \u201cdestruction lead hand\u201d in Langley, British Columbia to a \u201csoft gel encapsulation manager\u201d in Smiths Falls, Ontario. With operations in 12 countries, Canopy is also recruiting for a few international jobs, including a regional manager for natural health products in Frankfurt and a manager of medical affairs in Cape Town.Most of Canopy\u2019s hiring is happening in Canada however, as the country is the global centre of the legal cannabis industry, said CEO Bruce Linton.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a burden for the globe but it\u2019s being borne in Canada because it has the most medical patients and it\u2019s the best place to hire the people to do the research,\u201d Linton said in an interview.Aurora Cannabis Inc. has grown to 1,700 employees worldwide from 35 when Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley joined the company in March 2016, Battley said in an interview. The Edmonton, Alberta-based company currently has about 140 openings and is bringing 60 new employees on board each month.There\u2019s plenty of interested candidates, with Aurora getting between 200 to thousands of applications for each posting. Competition for workers is fierce, with Canada\u2019s jobless rate at a four-decades low of 5.8 per cent.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing in people from mature industries who probably wouldn\u2019t have considered a career in the cannabis business two years ago,\u201d Battley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people coming in from the logistics business, we\u2019ve got people coming in from agriculture and different sciences, we\u2019ve got people coming in from oil and gas.\u201dThe latter industry, largely based in Aurora\u2019s home province of Alberta, is suffering from the slump in Canadian crude prices, which fell to a record low in November.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve been one of the bright lights in the Alberta economy,\u201d Battley said.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Meghan L.

The price of Brent crude dropped US$6 a barrel, or eight per cent, in just the 24 hours after OPEC announced the outcome of its meeting. This Thanksgiving, there was no OPEC gathering, but last Friday, the Brent price still slid nearly US$4, or six per cent, to its lowest mark in a year. Although the price has since stabilized, we cannot rule out a further slip in the weeks or months ahead.The recent decrease in oil prices is what academics like to call \u201cover-determined.\u201d Despite recent jitters about a looming spike in the price of oil, both supply and demand have conspired to bring down prices. New production has come on line in recent months, be it from Clair Ridge (BP\u2019s new mega-oil field in the North Sea), record amounts of shale oil coming out of the U.S., or simply production increases by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia. Other developments \u2014 such as the hope to resolve infrastructure bottlenecks in the U.S. and a new agreement between Baghdad and the Kurds to allow the restart of exports from Kirkuk\u2019s contested oil fields \u2014 promise even more oil in the months ahead. Unexpected sanctions waivers issued by the Trump administration mean Iranian oil will not be squeezed out of global markets just yet. Meanwhile, the robust growth in oil demand of the past years appears to be easing, especially with trade frictions looking persistent.Oil\u2019s price could get another knock soon, depending on the outcome of the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6. Some variant of any of the usual three outcomes is possible: a real deal, rhetoric about a deal, or no deal. But the market will be particularly sensitive to the result, given the other factors weighing down oil right now.Prospects for a real deal \u2014 one that brings significant quantities of oil off the market to boost prices for a sustained period \u2014 are not particularly bright. OPEC alone is no longer capable of delivering a real deal.One of the lessons of the past few years is that, given new forces in the market, particularly America\u2019s shale oil, OPEC countries must join with others if they are going to be able to effect a significant enough cut to oil markets to notably raise prices and restore balance. The much-heralded Declaration of Cooperation of December 2016 brought 11 other countries alongside OPEC\u2019s traditional members. True, OPEC has formally welcomed new members into its ranks since this time, but neither Equatorial Guinea nor Congo bring game-changing cutting capacity to the organization. A real deal requires that the diverse group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers that stood together in 2016 do so once again in two weeks\u2019 time.Nor, at the other end of the extreme, can Saudi Arabia deliver a \u201creal deal\u201d on its own. In past decades, Saudi Arabia was sometimes willing to bear the brunt of production cuts in order to stabilize the oil price. In the past few years, Riyadh has declared its unwillingness to do this, often invoking its experience in the 1980s when its economy stumbled as a result of it bearing deep and extended solo production cuts. In recent days, the Saudis seem determined to return to the production levels of 2016 \u2014 another way of saying they could cut current production by as much as one million barrels a day. The Saudis do have room to execute such a cut; they are now producing at record levels and even a major cut would still leave them with substantial exports.A real deal requires that the diverse group of OPEC and non-OPEC producers that stood together in 2016 do so once againSuch a more-or-less unilateral move could have immediate costs. First, as widely noted, it could draw the ire of President Donald Trump, just when he has declared his willingness to stand by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman after the CIA linked the royal to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In addition, a big Saudi solo cut could erode the sense of joint responsibility for global oil markets instilled by the Declaration of Cooperation. And, as we know from recent years, such a cut will invite other producers to the market \u2014 likely in less than a year thanks to American shale \u2014 bringing down the price once again, this time at the expense of Saudi market share.Nevertheless, domestic pressures could induce MBS to prioritize the short term \u2014 and favour what is essentially a solo cut \u2014 over the medium and longer run. It is difficult to assess the domestic strength of the crown prince in the wake of the Khashoggi murder. But the probable execution of those in his inner circle for an operation he likely sanctioned will weaken his power base. He may have calculated that he cannot compound this situation with an economy that stresses the country with more unemployment and slowed growth. The relatively higher oil prices of 2018 have given Saudi Arabia a reprieve from the economic difficulties and grumblings of 2017, when the Saudi economy actually contracted. The crown prince may perceive it as essential that he has some economic largesse to weather the immediate political storm. Over the medium and longer term, however, Saudi Arabia cannot be expected to sustain solo cuts in the face of a moderating price and a shrunken Saudi market share.\u2026 even a major cut would still leave (the Saudis) with substantial exportsAnother option for Dec. 6 is a deal in rhetoric across OPEC and its non-OPEC brethren, but no deal in practice. This is the most likely scenario, and the market will be watching for it closely, with an eye on Russia and Iraq in particular. Before 2016, the Russian government often pledged cooperation with OPEC but never delivered on it. In the recent months, Russia has been producing over 11 million barrels of oil, notably beyond what it was producing before the 2016 production cuts. Iraq has had a quiet but significant boom in recent months, reaching record levels of 4.7 million barrels a day with additional production increases on the horizon. With a new government in Baghdad under pressure from its population to deliver services, and pressure from Washington to sever energy ties with Iran, Iraq will resist reining in its oil production now.The final option for Dec. 6 is, of course, an overt no-deal scenario. It is the least likely of the options, but it is not impossible. Tensions are running high in the region, and confidence in Saudi leadership \u2014 generally perceived to be the responsible actor of OPEC \u2014 has been shaken. Should an obvious no-deal situation materialize, expect the price of oil to plunge quickly, particularly in light of current market expectations. An overwhelming majority of analysts expect a supply cut, according to a recent Bloomberg poll.We will most likely see some sort of action in Vienna on Dec. 6 and even before. Yet anything short of a re-enactment of the Declaration of Cooperation moment of 2016 should be seen as only a short-term boost to prices in early 2019 and a likely precursor to an eventual price drop as 2019 progresses. A go-it-alone approach by Saudi Arabia is not sustainable, just as an agreement to cut without Russian and Iraqi enthusiasm is likely to be an empty promise.\u2022 Meghan L.

Payments owed to contractors were held up, and in June 2017 the kingdom led an unprecedented boycott of neighbouring Qatar.\u201cDomestically, the Ritz arrests were a transformative development \u2014 economically and politically,\u201d said Hani Sabra, founder of Alef Advisory, a New York-based consultancy. They were the \u201ccrystallization of a process that had been building.\u201dOfficials say the arrests were necessary to level the playing field among investors and curb rampant corruption \u2014 an argument that resonates with many Saudis who often complained that the elite were above the rule of law. Some of the prince\u2019s supporters also say a short-term decline in investment is an acceptable price to pay for a fundamental overhaul that will help create a more transparent business community.The Saudi central bank, responding to Bloomberg questions, reiterated that the kingdom places \u201cno restrictions on transfers.\u201dBut the scale of the purge, which ensnared people like billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, has left many worried about appearing to be rushing for the exit. To secure their release, detainees agreed to pay settlements that totaled more than US$100 billion. Allegations of torture \u2014 denied by the government \u2014 and the lack of transparency over settlements made the operation look more like a shakedown.As a result, some Saudis who did subsequently take money out of the country used a web of companies to disguise their ownership, and avoided places with close ties to the kingdom. Many looked to Switzerland or funds elsewhere in Europe, investing in real-estate and private equity funds, some of the people said.\u201cIt would be stupid not to make contingency plans,\u201d one Saudi businessman said.One person involved in structuring international deals for Saudis said clients have been shying away from eye-catching purchases. Instead of buying a five-star hotel in London, for example, they would invest the same amount on warehouses in the north of England, the person said.Money was leaving the country before the purge, partly because the economy slowed as authorities imposed austerity in response to low oil prices, said Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. If anything, capital flight probably declined due to the \u201cfear of drawing attention,\u201d he said.Total outflows are estimated to rise 13 per cent this year to US$90 billion, about 10 per cent of GDP, compared with 2017, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.But such aggregate figures include foreign investments by state institutions. There\u2019s no way to pinpoint how much private Saudi money has been trying to escape a country that\u2019s embarked on aggressive new policies at home and abroad. (On the same day they rounded up business leaders, Saudi authorities are also widely believed to have put Lebanon\u2019s visiting prime minister under effective house arrest.)The purge took place days after global executives attended the prince\u2019s flagship Future Investment Initiative conference at the Ritz-Carlton and lavished praise on his economic plans.After the arrests, some major banks lowered their forecast for loans to businesses, a key gauge of domestic demand. That quarter, private growth slowed sharply \u2014 even though oil prices were rebounding.Lagging investment from locals and foreigners, added to new taxes and fees on expats, has helped push unemployment to the highest in more than a decade.In an interview the day after Khashoggi disappeared, Prince Mohammed said the jobless rate will start coming down next year. He also predicted a rebound in foreign investment \u2014 starting with a sizable non-oil deal to be announced at the FII conference later that month.But then the outcry over Khashoggi began to build, prompting bankers and executives to drop out and turning this year\u2019s event into a subdued affair. The announcement never came.Saudi Arabia will find it hard to attract foreign money because of concerns about the way the country is run, Mobius said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Dubai. \u201cIf the leadership has questionable governance, how about the companies?\u201dOne regional investor, the head of an Arab family office who\u2019s put money into the kingdom before, said he has no plans to do so again. \u201cSaudi Arabia is off my map now,\u201d he said, asking not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his existing business.His reasoning is simple. \u201cIf I see people taking their money out of Saudi Arabia, despite opportunities there, why should I bring my money?\u201d\u2013With assistance from Donna Abu-Nasr, Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster and Archana Narayanan.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "'We're at a crisis and we don't even realize it': The dark side of Toronto's housing boom", "description": "Affordable housing is almost impossible to find as tighter mortgage rules and a surge in immigrants has created an all-out war for rentals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-lottery-with-501-odds-reveals-dark-side-of-toronto-boom?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/regent-park.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 26, 2018 3:48 PM EST", "content": "Debbie Ross has the same chance of snagging an affordable apartment in Toronto as she does picking a long-shot at the Kentucky Derby.Ross is hoping to win one of 75 rental apartments in a lottery run by the city\u2019s public housing agency. She\u2019s up against 3,779 others, so the odds of winning are only about 50:1 but figures it\u2019s as good a chance as any of finding a place to live.Long priced out of home ownership, Ross is now being squeezed out of the rental market as the country\u2019s biggest population boom since 1957 sends prices surging in Canada\u2019s biggest city.The 56-year-old unemployed office worker pays $1,026 (US$776) for her one-bedroom apartment. Her savings and unemployment insurance are running out and she\u2019s been looking for a cheaper place but units that were in her price range only a few years ago have nearly doubled.\u201cIt\u2019s so stressful and I suffer from heart palpitations and anxiety,\u201d said Ross from her 24th-floor apartment where hanging plants and bright cushions create a refuge in a dingy building in constant combat with pest infestations.As U.S. President Donald Trump has clamped down on high-tech visas and amped up the anti-immigration rhetoric Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a more welcoming approach. Canada took in a record 413,000 people from abroad in the year through July 1, pushing population growth to 1.4 per cent, the fastest in the Group of Seven.Almost 100,000 of those immigrants have landed in Toronto in the past year, including refugee claimants, a surge in international students and workers chasing thousands of new high-tech jobs at companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Add in those who can\u2019t meet stricter mortgage regulations after house prices jumped 60 per cent in the past five years and it\u2019s been an all out war for rentals.\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point now where given the amount of people, industries we\u2019re attracting, we are already becoming terribly unaffordable for everyone,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of several books on urban issues. \u201cWe\u2019re at a crisis and we don\u2019t even realize it: Our transit, traffic problem and housing problem are urgent matters.\u201dSupply isn\u2019t beginning to keep up. Condo completions have been running near a five-year low of about 10,000 units, according to Altus Group Ltd. And only about 60 purpose-built rental buildings have been constructed since 2005, bringing a meager 11,620 units to market when the city\u2019s been creating about 17,000 renter households a year, according to property research firm Urbanation Inc.The result has been skyrocketing prices. Condo rents soared 7.6 per cent to an average $2,385 in the third quarter over the same period a year ago and were up 17 per cent for newly available purpose-built units, according to data from Urbanation. Meanwhile, the apartment vacancy rate sits at about 0.5 per cent.Homelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,That might still be a bargain compared with cities like San Francisco, where a one-bedroom went for US$3,333 in 2017 or New York where it cost US$2,811, though prices in those cities have stabilized over the past year.Those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder are getting hit the hardest.\u201cHomelessness is growing, couch-surfing is growing and this will have a lot of pressure on families and on the city itself,\u201d said Alejandra Ruiz Vargas, a member at Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now Canada, which represents low and moderate-income families.With asylum claims to Canada also doubling in the past year, it\u2019s getting harder for refugees to find housing too, said Lucy Chaimiti, executive director at Adam House, a refugee support group. It usually takes people four to six months to find housing after arriving in the city and they usually end up spending about 85 per cent of their social assistance income on housing, she said.City and provincial policymakers are beginning to wake up to the brewing affordability crisis. In an election dominated by housing last month, Mayor John Tory pledged to bring 40,000 affordable rental units to the city over the next decade, offering city land, cash incentives and to cancel or defer development charges and taxes.While there are rent controls on existing units, the new provincial government has dropped them on new construction in an effort to entice development. Some builders such as Tricon Capital Group Inc. have already jumped on the affordable bandwagon.Affordable housing needs to be created for those who \u201care not investment bankers or cannabis entrepreneurs,\u201d RioCan REIT Chief Executive Officer Ed Sonshine said in an earnings call in October. RioCan is interested in getting into the market, but government incentives needs to be higher, he said in a phone interview.Toronto meanwhile, needs to get more creative to broaden the types of housing available, said Florida, at University of Toronto. Companies could focus on housing that uses pre-treated timber or modular construction, speedier, cheaper home-building alternatives.\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting priced out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy students at the Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto, who are going to be some of the most successful students in Canadian business, are now saying it\u2019s doubtful they could ever afford a single-family home.\u201dMeanwhile, Ross is running out of options as she scrambles to secure future housing. She\u2019s anxiously awaiting to hear back from the lottery which is offering up a one-bedroom unit for $962 including utilities in the redeveloped Regent Park. The former crack haven is now a mixed-used neighbourhood that includes affordable rentals and market-priced condos alongside sports fields, an aquatic centre, community meeting spaces and cafes.The city will likely need dozens of such neighbourhoods to handle the influx in newcomers.At one point, Ross even called a shelter to see what her options would be if she was kicked out of her apartment. \u201cThey said you have to call weeks in advance. How do you call weeks in advance if you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to be homeless?\u201d\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Ontario sharpens axe as it readies plan to cut mounting $15-billion deficit", "description": "Ontario has the world's largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt, clocking in at $338 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/ontario-sharpens-axe-as-it-readies-plan-to-cut-mounting-deficit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ontario.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 15, 2018 9:43 AM EST", "content": "Investors will be watching for hints as how Ontario plans to start tackling the world\u2019s largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt when the Canadian province gives a snapshot of its finances on Thursday.Finance Minister Victor Fedeli will unveil the new government\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook in the provincial legislature starting at about 1:15 p.m. While not an official budget, the document will outline the government\u2019s initial assessment of a province that\u2019s growing moderately while steadily racking up debt.Ontario\u2019s deficit is poised to reach about $15 billion (US$11 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, more than double the previous government\u2019s forecast, while net debt stands at about $338 billion, the highest of any sub-sovereign borrower rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\u201cGiven that the new government stands for good management, I would expect them to address the deficit as a priority,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI would expect a significant reduction of the deficit fairly early in its mandate.\u201dPremier Doug Ford has committed to balancing the books over time and has already begun to rein in spending, scrapping a pilot basic income program and capping social assistance. Together with other measures, that could save $2 billion this year, according to report from Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Allowing other programs to lapse could save another $1 billion while freezing a minimum wage hike may support employment and boost revenues, the bank said.But the Progressive Conservative government, which swept to power in June, also made some costly campaign pledges which could push the budget shortfall to as high as $18.7 billion in 2019-20, according to TD. Those promises included a cut to corporate and personal income taxes and reduction in the gas tax.\u201cHow this is going to line up with the campaign promise to balance is going to be interesting,\u201d said Joey Mack, Toronto-based director of fixed income at GMP Securities LP. \u201cBut given all the announcements pointing to huge deficits, I don\u2019t think we will get too much reaction\u201d if the deficit stays below $18 billion, he said.Ontario is expected to grow at about 2 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent next year according economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Ontario bonds have declined 1.5 per cent this year, trailing the 1.3 per cent drop for Quebec and 1.1 per cent for the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch bond index of provincial borrowers. Investors in Ontario\u2019s 2.9 per cent bonds due 20128 demand about 67 basis points over similar duration federal Canada debt, according to bid prices in Bloomberg.While risk premiums aren\u2019t a source of big concern, the absolute yields are rising as the Bank of Canada and other central banks around the world increase interest rates to cool inflationary pressures. Since the end of June, when Ford took office, the yield investors demand to hold province\u2019s debt maturing between three months and five years have increased between 40 and 50 basis points, Bloomberg data show.\u201cAn interest rate increase of 25 basis points will cost Ontario taxpayers an additional $100 million a year in interest payments,\u201d Fedeli wrote in a Nov. 1 opinion column for the Toronto Sun. \u201cFor the government of Ontario, interest rate increases pose a significant challenge.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
