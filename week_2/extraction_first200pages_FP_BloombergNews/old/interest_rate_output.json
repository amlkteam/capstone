HSBC said that the gold market \u201cbecame highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,\u201d contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to \u201cmarket volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.\u201d It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC\u2019s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium. The precious metal surged more than 30% in the first three weeks of January, before tumbling at the end of the month.Read More: HSBC, BNP Repeatedly Breached Trading Limits in Market ChaosHSBC is not alone in its recent struggles with precious metals.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada set for bigger buying spree \u2014 here\u2019s where the billions might go", "description": "Next up may be provincial debt which is showing signs of credit strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-for-bigger-buying-spree-decision-day-guide", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stephen-poloz-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 6:00 AM EDT", "content": "As Stephen Poloz goes into his penultimate policy meeting as Bank of Canada governor on Wednesday, economists are trying to gauge how much of a buying mood he\u2019s in.With the country suffering one of its sharpest downturns since the Great Depression, Poloz is widely expected to dig deeper into his unconventional toolkit, whether that\u2019s at the April 15 meeting or later. The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt. \n\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years\nWhy Trudeau should put aside his personal agenda and ask Bank of Canada's Poloz to delay retirement\nCanada is at a critical juncture \u2014 if we don\u2019t transform our economy then we will face a greater crisis\nOne thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?Expanding PurchasesThe central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Provide ClarityAustralia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric Martin", "title": "\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years", "description": "In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-says-great-lockdown-recession-likely-worst-since-depression?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund predicted the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy\u2019s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns.In its first World Economic Outlook report since the spread of the coronavirus and subsequent freezing of major economies, the IMF estimated on Tuesday that global gross domestic product will shrink 3 per cent this year.That compares to a January projection of 3.3 per cent expansion and would likely mark the deepest dive since the Great Depression. It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockGita Gopinath, IMF's chief economist \n \nWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency. \nAdvanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs\nThe \u2018terrible agonizing noise\u2019 of Canada\u2019s economic data in a crisis like no other\nMillennials are getting crushed by back-to-back economic crises\nIn a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF\u2019s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks.

U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments.

He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'This is freezing the market': Once roaring, Canadian home sales brace for 30% drop from coronavirus", "description": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-home-sales-30-percent-drop-coronavirus?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/for-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 2, 2020 12:23 PM EDT", "content": "Real estate listings are drying up, open houses have been cancelled, and buyers are staying home. One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201d \nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nOpen houses going extinct as Canadian housing market grapples with coronavirus fallout\nMortgage rates on the rise again as coronavirus and oil shock weigh on lenders\u2019 minds\nReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt \n \nHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dRebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts", "description": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.\u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Funding CostsTypical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.\u201cThe big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,\u201d he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they\u2019re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.\u201cThe banks just can\u2019t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,\u201d Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.\u201cI believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada cuts rate for third time to 0.25% in bid to shield economy from coronavirus fallout", "description": "The last time the rate was this low was the global financial crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/breaking-bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-emergency-move?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/boc-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 27, 2020 11:15 AM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks and announced plans to acquire more commercial paper and government securities to help shield the nation\u2019s economy from coronavirus fallout.The central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers. \nOttawa asks banks, credit-card companies to lower interest rates\n\u2018We will overcome this:\u2019 G20 leaders vow to strengthen global financial safety net\nJack M. Mintz: Canada needs to think BIG now to avoid a long, deep recession\n\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett says negative interest rates puzzle him, but don't scare him", "description": "Buffett cautions he's not an expert in predicting interest rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/warren-buffett-says-negative-interest-rates-puzzle-him-but-dont-scare-him", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/warren-buffett-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 18, 2020 1:35 PM EDT", "content": "Warren Buffett said the prospect of negative interest rates is a bit confusing.\u201cThey puzzle me, but they don\u2019t scare me,\u201d Buffett said in a Yahoo Finance interview when asked if negative rates frighten him.U.S. policy makers have been seeking to grapple with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with the Federal Reserve on Sunday cutting its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used.

That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession.

Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank\u2019s isn\u2019t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada\u2019s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank \u2014 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois PerraultSees Canada\u2019s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP. Without fiscal stimulus, Q2 and Q3 GDP will contract.

Monday\u2019s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added. \nPeter Tertzakian: This crude war is about a lot more than oil prices and market share\nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nOil price war tests Canadian energy producers' years-long drive to cut costs\nThe oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growthBeata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank \n \n\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.Trudeau\u2019s TurnThe Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Stephen Spratt, Ruth Carson and Dana El Baltaji", "title": "'The market is panicking': Fed seen cutting rates to 0% within months, fuelling a global bond frenzy", "description": "The entire U.S. yield curve fell below 1 per cent for the first time in history as investors reached for longer-dated securities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/frantic-treasury-rally-sees-yield-curve-inside-1-for-first-time?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jerome-powell-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2020 10:45 AM EDT", "content": "The entire U.S. yield curve fell below 1 per cent for the first time in history as rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut policy rates to zero in the coming months drove investors to reach for longer-dated securities.Traders are pricing in about 80 basis points of cuts in March, and 100 basis points by July, which would drag borrowing costs down to zero.

Italian bonds plunged, sending the yield on 10-year debt to 1.3 per cent.Meanwhile, the yen and the euro strengthened. And the dollar, which suffered its worst week in two years, was up 0.2 per cent, as soaring demand for U.S. Treasuries canceled out concerns that more Fed cuts would hurt the greenback\u2019s appeal. The dollar has an edge over its peers by being the world\u2019s reserve currency of choice.On a TearTreasuries, the world\u2019s deepest pool of haven assets, have been rallying in the past few weeks as the virus wreaked havoc across the globe.

Most of the German curve is now trading under negative 0.55 per cent, which, together with the euro\u2019s advance, may give the European Central Bank food for thought when it decides on interest rates this week.\u201cWe know what the financial crisis looked like, the tech wreck, but this bond rally we\u2019re seeing is just unchartered waters,\u201d said Stephen Miller, adviser at GSFM, a unit of Canada\u2019s CI Financial Group. \u201cA global recession is now a probability, not a possibility.\u201dCentral Bank ActionFederal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that policy makers should be allowed to buy a broader range of assets if they lack sufficient ammunition to fight off a recession with interest-rate cuts and bond purchases.And money managers are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to turn to QE as soon as the middle of the year, while bets are increasing for the Bank of Japan to ease this month.\u201cThe market is panicking,\u201d said Shinji Hiramatsu, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. \u201cPosition adjustment, loss-cut buying and all sorts of buying are emerging.

While the data is generally healthy, the gains of recent months aren\u2019t likely to last if coronavirus concerns continue to seep into broader consumer and business confidence The report showed a moderate gain in employment but still reflects a deceleration in job growth from the monster employment gains seen in the first half of 2020 Get MoreBritish Columbia and Ontario posted the biggest job losses; they also saw the unemployment rate rise notably as more people searched for work, the report stated Quebec posted notable job gains of 20,000 continuing a trend of solid growth in employment in the province for several months, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent, the lowest since at least 1976.

When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nThat is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201d1990s ReplayPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.Missing SignalsFor Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d \nU.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rate: Read the official statement\nFalling victim to market fear may do more damage to your portfolio than the coronavirus itself\nJustin Trudeau opens door to possible aid for Canadian companies hit by virus\nPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.G7 CoordinationThe Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2020U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.Clarida StanceAs recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.No Silver BulletOne lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram and Michael Bellusci", "title": "TSX snaps six-day losing streak as global stocks rally on central bank hopes", "description": "Boost comes from news that finance ministers and bankers to hold teleconference on coronavirus response Tuesday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/rate-cut-hopes-fuel-tentative-rebound-in-canadian-stocks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 2, 2020 1:52 PM EST", "content": "Canadian stocks clawed their way into the green, snapping a six-day losing streak as expectations mounted central banks would cut interest rates to flight the growing impact of the coronavirus.The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose about 0.8 per cent to 16,382.02 at 11:21 a.m. in Toronto, buoyed by gains in telcos, utilities and real estate.

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a \u2018long lasting\u2019 epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks\u2019 action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points. \nOECD warns coronavirus could halve global growth\nCoronavirus will likely shave off 0.5% of Canadian GDP; 50bps BoC rate cut 'not impossible', analysts say\nCoronavirus to knock U.S. earnings growth to zero, Goldman says\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.\u201cGlobal central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201dWith interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.\u201cCentral banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, \u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.Japan to IndonesiaThe Bank of Japan backed up Monday\u2019s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia\u2019s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan\u2019s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan\u2019s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed\u2019s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn\u2019t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde\u2019s comments of last week.\u201cWe are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Less Effective?Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closed \n \nFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That\u2019s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world\u2019s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won\u2019t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they\u2019re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.\u201cRate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,\u201d said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Canadian investors gripped by fear amid coronavirus, economic chill from rail blockades", "description": "Canada's stock market rally has cracked.

Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday.Belski isn\u2019t so worried. \u201cWhile the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.\u201d Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.Wild RideMarket turbulence has surged.

Some investors have soured on banks because of concerns about declining interest rates, mortgage quality and high levels of consumer debt, which are a risk to the economy.\u201cThe focus changed to the insurers because they hadn\u2019t done well when the banks were performing at their peak,\u201d he said.\u201cLifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcome,\u201d Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a Jan. 28 report. \u201cAs long as growth concerns for the banks remain intense, this trend could continue.\u201dLifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcomeGabriel Dechaine \n \nWhen lifecos release fourth-quarter results next week, analysts are expecting them to show a strong finish to 2019.

But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.\u201cThe relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Dechaine.

The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group. Once Manulife is excluded, \u201cthe sector is trading inline to historical averages and to the Big Six,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Vildana Hajric", "title": "\u2018Sell first, ask questions later\u2019: Stocks tumble around the world as coronavirus spreads", "description": "'I'm starting to think cash is the right place to be for the next few weeks'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-futures-oil-tumble-yen-jumps-on-virus-fear-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/coronavirus-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 26, 2020 6:38 PM EST", "content": "Stocks slumped and bonds rallied as concern over the impact of a deadly virus that originated in China rattled global markets.The S&P 500 Index slid the most in almost four months, with energy and tech companies leading losses.

That\u2019s the view of Randall Malcolm, Toronto-based senior managing director of fixed income at SLC Management, which oversees $227 billion (US$173.8 billion).\u201cWe like to have liquidity in the 20-year part of the curve as we have liability-matching needs across all terms,\u201d Malcolm said in an interview. \u201cIt makes sense for them to issue for a few reasons.

Canada currently sells 10- and 30-year bonds \u2014 the last time Canada\u2019s Department of Finance issued 20-year bonds was in 1990, according to government data.A 20-year Canadian bond would yield around 1.65 per cent, according to Bloomberg Valuation estimates. That\u2019s ten basis points less than the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate. By comparison, U.S. Treasuries maturing in 20 years would yield 2.10 per cent, or 55 basis points above the Fed effective rate.Exploring new maturities could make sense at a time when Canada anticipates greater-than-expected deficits. Finance Minister Bill Morneau released estimates last month that showed a budget shortfall for the five-year period between 2019 and 2023 exceeding prior forecasts by about $35 billion.\u201cLocking in lower rates for longer terms gives Canadians greater confidence that a return to higher rates will not impact our standard of life as much,\u201d said Malcolm. \u201cAlso, if the government is going to fund long-term infrastructure projects to spur growth, it makes sense to match the term of the funding with the life of the asset.\u201dHowever, not everyone says Canada should introduce a new maturity. Instead, the country should increase the frequency of its 10- and 30-year bond offerings, Mark Chandler, head of fixed-income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview.A press officer at the Department of Finance in Ottawa said Canada doesn\u2019t have plans to issue a 20-year bond at the moment.

His warning of a U.S. housing bubble in 2005 when he was at Merrill Lynch proved prescient but he stayed bearish long after the economy had revived. He was bullish for five years starting in 2012 but has turned negative in recent years.This is a liquidity-driven market. Liquidity is your best friend on Monday and your worst coward on FridayDavid Rosenberg \n \nThe roaring stock market is essentially a \u201cbull market in financial engineering,\u201d stoked by the Fed Reserve\u2019s purchases of Treasury bills starting in October, interest rate cuts, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul (which handed America\u2019s top banks a US$32 billion windfall) and corporate share buybacks.\u201cLast year, was like, just throw a dart,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s indiscriminate buying. Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be like that. Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be easy.\u201dThe Debate Over Whether to Call It QE Is Over, and the Fed LostWhile economists only see a 30 per cent chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, Rosenberg said a retreat in spending on restaurants, movies and furnishings and other discretionary spending are harbingers of a slowdown, along with a deceleration in U.S. core inflation.\u201cWhen you stop hearing \u2018where are we going for dinner tonight?\u2019 and instead you start hearing \u2018who\u2019s cooking dinner?\u2019 then you know that a new form of frugality is taking place.\u201dHere\u2019s how he\u2019s battening down the hatches in his model portfolio:Gold\u201cGold is a place you want to be. I think that it\u2019s partly because its inversely correlated with interest rates. But it\u2019s also an insurance policy when things go wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a no-brainer, but this is close.\u201dBullion is off to a roaring start this year as strategists from Goldman Sachs to UBS Group AG called for $1,600 an ounce even before the Iranian crisis impacted global markets.

Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor. The country has also pushed companies to distribute dividends, introduce and/or expand share buybacks and have allowed for foreigners on corporate boards as shareholder activism picks up. \u201cThis is revolutionary in Japan.\u201dBonds in DragBond-proxies in the stock market, or what Rosenberg calls \u201cbonds in drag\u201d are also good investments as the economy heads into a downturn. Utilities, REITs and pipelines, which he calls asset-backed cash flow generators, are worth holding.\u201cIt\u2019s really more about putting together a portfolio of stocks \u2014 non-cyclical, liquid, strong balance sheets, with not much of a refinancing calendar that have been able to increase their dividends,\u201d he said.\u201cDownright cheap\u201d energy stocks are also favoured by Rosenberg. \u201cEnergy stocks are not priced for WTI where we are right now. They are priced for something that\u2019s gotta be at least 20 per cent \u2013 30 per cent lower.\u201dDefence stocks are a cheaper way to boost exposure to tech as countries beef up military spending. \u201cDefence is actually a technology.

Investors looking to diversify their portfolios are seeking shelter in low volatility assets that tend to be illiquid like infrastructure investments. \nCanada\u2019s biggest pensions may be at home on the world stage, but many others stay local to their detriment\nCPPIB posts over 2% return in second quarter\nCPPIB sells off holdings in two U.S. prisons on reputational risk\nBut the rapid dash to alternative assets by the stewards of retirement cash comes with risks, and it\u2019s caught the attention of regulators. One major worry is that a downturn in funds would struggle to pull cash out of illiquid assets. While pension funds typically hold debt until maturity it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be hurt by mark-to-market losses.The head of CPPIB said that while there\u2019s little to worry about in the near-term, investors should be very careful about the huge shift of assets from public to private markets which could trigger steeper selloffs and exacerbate a crisis.Trade Tensions\u201cYou have to be very careful to make sure that you truly understand the liquidity positions, that you truly understand if that thing turns out to not be liquid you can still cope, and if you can still pay the university, the pensioners,\u201d he said.The Toronto-based pension fund manages $409.5 billion (US$313 billion) in assets for about 20 million Canadian pensioners. Half of that is in illiquid assets, Machin said. CPPIB reported a 2.3 per cent return on investments for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Its ten and five-year annualized net nominal returns were 10.2 per cent and 10.3 per cent respectively.I do worry about the expansion of a lot of funds like us around the world into private illiquid assetsMark Machin \n \n\u201cOur view is that these global trade tensions will continue and create some weight on global trading and supply chains and technology. There is nowhere to hide from that so you need to diversify,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you sell, you have to hold something. For us, you\u2019d have to invest in something else either its cash or some physical commodities.\u201dCPPIB, which currently holds about 85 per cent of its assets outside of Canada, plans to boost exposure to better-yielding emerging markets, lifting that allocation to one-third of its portfolio in the next five years.

Ian Bremmer, a delegate at the World Economy Forum\u2019s annual meeting and founder of Eurasia Group, describes this year as a \u201ctipping point.\u201dThe theme is captured throughout the Davos program, which contains multiple panels on \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d and tackling inequality. Participants will also discuss the future of globalization and whether central banks are out of ammunition. \nInterest rates have been a tailwind for investors for 40 years. Will this be the decade that changes?\n'Major mindset change': What\u2019s in store for Canada\u2019s energy sector in 2020 \u2013 podcast\nBeware the pitfalls and perils of the gig economy\nHere are the hot talking points:Peak Globalization?The era of people, goods and money flowing increasingly unchecked around the world may have past its high point as governments pursue protectionism and erect more obstacles to migration. Already there are around 77 physical barriers delineating international borders compared with 15 in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, according to Bank of America. The World Trade Organization calculates the pace of growth in international commerce fell below the rate of economic expansion in 2019 for the fifth time since the financial crisis. Foreign direct investment inflows have been on the decline since 2015, says the United Nations.The U.S.-China trade war is at the center of the shift. But even with the signing of an interim deal, the Peterson Institute for International Economics reckons the average U.S. tariff on imports from China is still 19.3 per cent versus 3.1 per cent at the start of 2018. Away from Beijing, Trump is also seeking to remodel the World Trade Organization and potentially clamp down on European auto exports. The U.K. still needs to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.Still, the continued development of the digital economy, rising tourism and mounting reliance of companies on revenues generated outside their home market provide room for confidence globalization is evolving rather than ending.Peak Capitalism?JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc. Founder Laurence Fink, both of whom will be in Davos, are among those who have entered the debate over whether companies should better weigh stakeholders such as customers and employees, a departure from the decades-old shareholder-first mindset.Behind the shift: the rise of populism, concern wages aren\u2019t keeping up with assets such as equities and fears over climate change.The maturing millennial generation are a driving force too. When making investment decisions, 87 per cent of those born between 1981 and 1996 believe environmental, social and governance factors are important, according to Bank of America.Peak Inequality?The pressure to reduce inequality will become more urgent this decade as the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals approach their 2030 deadline. 193 governments have signed up to 17 goals, 169 targets and 304 indicators on how to end poverty, clean up the environment and share prosperity for all.There has already been some progress. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, last year\u2019s winners of the Nobel Prize for economics, estimate the average income of the world\u2019s bottom 50 per cent of earners also almost doubled since 1980.But William Gale of the Brookings Institution notes the 400 richest Americans owned 3.26 per cent of wealth in 2018, up from 0.93 per cent in 1982. The top 1 per cent also paid about a third of their income in tax in both 1979 and 2019, he says. Expect such numbers to be bandied about ahead of the U.S. election in November, with some Democrat candidates promoting higher corporate and wealth taxes.Peak Youth?For the first time, there are now more seniors than children in the world and that trend is set to escalate, according to the UN. The global fertility rate already halved from 5 children per woman in 1955 and the average life expectancy has increased from 31 in 1900 to 72 today and is tipped to reach 83 by the end of this century.While another 1 billion people are expected on the planet by 2030, the demographic mix will be starkly different. For starters, the number of those aged 65 or older will outnumber children under the age of 5.The growth of the working age population is also set to slow, straining pensions and healthcare resources. In a recent paper, Stanford University Professor Charles Jones said there is a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that global population will decline rather than stabilize in the long run, threatening economic growth.Peak Climate Change?The world faces a sweeping series of climate-related tipping points \u2014 from melting ice caps to droughts and dying coral reefs. Nature magazine in November collated the risks, which they described as a climate emergency that will compel political and economic actions on emissions. 21 of the hottest years on record came in the last quarter century.\u201cWe argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best,\u201d the article\u2019s authors wrote.The international effort to rein in fossil fuel pollution took a knock in December after marathon UN talks watered down language on issues they had agreed on in previous years.Peak oil demand?Hotter temperatures have put new scrutiny on the world\u2019s energy mix.This means renewable energy like solar and wind, plus electric vehicles are going to soar up the policy agenda at the cost of fossil fuel gurgling vehicles. Big Oil executives believe that peak oil demand is increasingly likely in the late 2030s.For example, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and the most profitable company in the planet, said on its initial public offering prospectus that oil demand may peak around 2035, with demand \u201cleveling off.\u201dPeak Cars?The 1.3 billion vehicles on the roads today are probably the most there will ever be. Megacities will house around two thirds of the global population by mid-century, cutting back on the need for expensive cars.Evolving urban architecture will also increasingly constrain car usage. The shift is already underway in mature markets. Only 26 per cent of U.S. 16-year-olds earned a driver\u2019s licence in 2017 compared with almost half just 36 years ago, according to Sivak Applied Research. Even if overall car sales remain robust, cheaper technology such as robotaxis and developments such as ride-sharing stand to take the shine off their attractiveness.Peak Central Banks?Central banks may have rescued the world from depression in the wake of the financial crisis, but their ability to turnaround their economies from here is limited after what Bank of America estimates is more than 700 interest rate cuts and around US$12 trillion in quantitative easing since 2009.Negative interest rates are already being blamed for hurting banks, while demographic shifts, record debt levels, technological disruption and bank deleveraging all sap the potency of monetary policy. That leaves politicians under pressure to loosen fiscal policy the next time trouble hits the world economy.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s home sales drop for first time in 10 months, but prices rise because of dwindling supply", "description": "Data reveal a tightening in a number of real estate markets across the country, especially Toronto", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-home-sales-drop-for-first-time-in-10-months-but-prices-rise-because-of-dwindling-supply?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 15, 2020 12:59 PM EST", "content": "Canadian real estate is increasingly becoming a seller\u2019s market as supply shrinks to decade lows, raising the prospect of rising prices and the re-emergence of froth in some major cities.New listings in cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa declined sharply at the end of last year, resulting in the fewest homes available for sale in 12 years, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported Wednesday.

Home sales, meanwhile, fell last month for the first time since February, extending a recent slowdown.Sales in Toronto dropped 3 per cent in December, with new listings in that market down 5.7 per cent.Even with the recent slowdown, national home sales for all of 2019 rose 6.5 per cent from the previous year, reflecting stronger demand from lower interest rates, a strong labour market and rising population.

Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Tight Toronto housing market pushes prices to record highs with biggest gains in three years", "description": "'Expect further acceleration in 2020 if there is no relief on the supply front'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/tight-toronto-housing-market-pushes-prices-up-most-since-2017", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 7, 2020 12:07 PM EST", "content": "Home sales dropped in Toronto in December, but prices continued to rise as demand outstripped a dwindling supply of units available for purchase.The number of homes sold in Canada\u2019s largest city fell 3 per cent from November, the biggest decline since February, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Tuesday.

Calhoun ran GE\u2019s aircraft engines division from 2000 through 2004 and ascended to the vice chairman role before leaving the company in 2006.Affable and diplomatic, he\u2019s also very connected. Calhoun serves on the Caterpillar Inc. board with Muilenburg and oversees Blackstone\u2019s private equity portfolio.He will serve as a \u201cstabilizer\u201d as Boeing works itself out of the Max crisis, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with Teal Group.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt with Congress and regulators this is a lot better, and in the short run that matters a lot,\u201d Aboulafia said.But in the longer term, Boeing faces daunting product-development decisions \u2014 starting with whether or when to replace the 737 Max \u2014 that will be difficult for a company outsider with no engineering background, Aboulafia said.\u201cAs long-term leader, GE plus private equity would appear to be not the right background given their needs right now,\u201d he said of Calhoun.One of the criticisms of Muilenburg, an aerospace engineer who spent his entire career at Boeing, was his lack of experience running commercial aircraft programs. The former Boeing CEO ascended through the defence division.One of Calhoun\u2019s first moves Monday was to reach out to FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to discuss the leadership transition at Boeing, said a personfamiliar with the call who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak about it.\u201cWe expect that Boeing will support that process by focusing on the quality and timeliness of data submittals for FAA review, as well as being transparent in its relationship with the FAA as safety regulator,\u201d the agency said by email.Fall From GraceMuilenburg\u2019s departure caps an extraordinary fall from grace for an Iowa farmer\u2019s son who had dreamed of turning Boeing into a globally admired corporate paragon, much as Welch did for GE. For two years as CEO, Muilenburg seemed to have the Midas touch. Then a brand-new Lion Air 737 Max plunged into the Java Sea on Oct. 29, 2018.While the plane\u2019s design was largely set before Muilenburg became CEO, he bore responsibility for the company\u2019s initial muted response \u2014 and the media firestorm that ensued when a second Max crashed less than five months later in Ethiopia. He would later describe the Max tragedies as the most difficult moments of a career spanning more than three decades, all at Boeing.Muilenburg, 55, joined the company from Iowa State University as an intern in 1985. Over the next three decades, the aerospace engineer rose to increasingly prominent positions at the defence business of the Chicago-based manufacturer. As head of the division, he drove deep cuts to maintain profits when Pentagon spending was stagnant.Sales BoomHe succeeded McNerney as CEO in mid-2015 amid the biggest sales boom in aviation history, fuelled by low interest rates, readily available financing and the rapid expansion of low-cost airlines, particularly in Asia. Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner started generating cash months after Muilenburg took office, after a decade of losses. The plane, along with the highly profitable 737, funded the increasingly generous returns the company lavished on investors.An avid cyclist fuelled by diet Mountain Dew, the whip-thin Muilenburg brought an unapologetic, hard-charging edge to Boeing. \u201cCompete to win,\u201d became a company mantra. He demanded deeper discounts from suppliers while creating new businesses that poached sales from its partners in everything from cockpit electronics to the mini jet engines housed in an aircraft\u2019s tail.The efforts helped turn Boeing into the most valuable U.S. industrial company, surpassing GE\u2019s dimming star, as the planemaker\u2019s market capitalization surged past US$200 billion. Under Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s shares more than tripled through early 2019, far outpacing the broader market.But the hard-nosed approach came back to haunt Boeing and its CEO. Responding to a preliminary accident report about the Lion Air crash, the company infuriated the carrier, one of its largest Max customers, by highlighting maintenance miscues on the doomed aircraft.Boeing MistakesBoeing shocked pilots around the world after the accident when it revealed that an obscure flight-control subsystem known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System played a role in the accident.While the company had described MCAS to Max operators, it had removed references from flight-crew manuals. The Lion Air pilots had no knowledge of the system, which was tripped by an erroneous sensor reading and then shoved the plane\u2019s nose down more than 20 times until they lost control.Regulators worldwide began grounding the Max hours after the March crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, even as Boeing\u2019s leaders and the FAA stood by the plane and recommended more investigation before taking action. In the aftermath, Muilenburg sent a message to employees saying he was \u201cconfident in the safety of the 737 Max.\u201dHis tone changed over the following weeks and months. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from both of these accidents,\u201d Muilenburg said in an interview in September. \u201cWe\u2019re humbled, and learning, but we\u2019re also confident. We know we have a great company with great people.\u201dSnowballing ProblemsIt wasn\u2019t enough.Boeing\u2019s problems snowballed as additional problems arose and regulators expanded their review of the Max beyond MCAS. There was the revelation that a cockpit light that might have alerted the crews to the sensor malfunction was inoperable in most Max jets because of a coding error. While Boeing had known of the issue for more than a year, it didn\u2019t alert the FAA or airlines until after the Lion Air crash.As the grounding dragged on, Boeing faced the logistical challenge of storing hundreds of factory-fresh planes while keeping cash-strapped suppliers afloat. Fairly or not, the company\u2019s laser focus on cash and costs reinforced a narrative that it had been lax on safety.The leadership change was lauded by Michael Stumo, the father of Samya Stumo, who died on the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10. She was the grand niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader.Michael Stumo called the crash \u201cpreventable\u201d and said Boeing now needs to clean house on its board.\u201cMr. Muilenburg\u2019s resignation is a good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation,\u201d Stumo said in a statement. \u201cNow that it\u2019s known what he and top Boeing officials knew, yet ignored, prior to the crashes, it has become clear how the company eroded in quality over the years.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Alan Levin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Forget interest rate decisions.

That may help unlock shareholder value. Neither Power Financial nor Power Corp. have regained their pre-2008 financial crisis highs, unlike the country\u2019s big banks.Power Corp. also said the new structure should allow the company to focus on financial services, where it faces relentless pressure on fees from ETFs and robo advisers, and from declining interest rates for its life insurance business.

He views stock valuations, at 10.5 times next year\u2019s estimated earnings, and 10 times his 2021 profit forecast, as \u201creasonable given the uncertain growth outlook.\u201d\u201cWe think the sector needs to demonstrate an EPS catalyst in order to improve sentiment towards the stocks,\u201d Malhotra said in a note Monday.The eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has returned 10 per cent so far this year. The index fell 11 per cent last year, after posting an 11 per cent increase in 2017 and a 25 per cent surge in 2016.Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan also cut his forecasts, and now sees 4 per cent growth in 2020 and 5 per cent in 2021. \u201cWe believe annual EPS revisions are an important factor regarding near-term share performance,\u201d he said in a note Wednesday.National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine pared his 2020 earnings expectations for Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for each of the next two fiscal years. He lifted his forecasts for National Bank of Canada for both years. Issues facing the banks include margin pressure from low interest rates and credit, Dechaine said.\u201cWhile credit trends are \u2018normalizing\u2019 as opposed to spiking, domestic indicators such as rising insolvency rates and November\u2019s weak jobs data will likely maintain upward pressure on loan losses,\u201d Dechaine said in a Dec. 8 note. He expects the industry EPS loan-loss rate to rise to 36 basis points in 2020, and 38 basis points in 2021, from 33 basis points in fiscal 2019.Not all forecasts for the industry are so dire.

While the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures.Consumption has long propelled Canada\u2019s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade.

But a slew of bad data may provide the central bank with more ammunition if it decides to lower borrowing costs at its next meeting on Dec. 4.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the economy to decelerate to a yearly pace of 1.5 per cent in 2019 and 2020, in line with expectations for slower global growth.Bloomberg.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-f69ded79bc9a28a7f2367df16b746d8f-5ebcb13a4a85d');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-f69ded79bc9a28a7f2367df16b746d8f-5ebcb13a4a85d');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-f69ded79bc9a28a7f2367df16b746d8f-5ebcb13a4a85d'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Surge in number of Canadians who can't pay their debts has economists worried \u2014 and scratching their heads", "description": "Insolvencies are accelerating at a pace that's been associated with periods of distress, yet the economic backdrop has been positive", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/rising-insolvency-readings-raise-red-flags-in-canada-sort-of?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/insolvency.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 18, 2019 1:25 PM EST", "content": "A surge in the number of people who can\u2019t play their debts is raising eyebrows in Canada.Some 11,935 consumers filed for insolvency in September, according to the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy \u2014 a 19 per cent increase from a year earlier and the biggest annual gain since 2009. So far in 2019, there have been 102,023 consumer insolvencies, the second-most for the first nine months of a year in records dating back to 1987.While the increases are coming from low levels, the trend is a worrying development that suggests cracks are starting to appear in Canada\u2019s household debt landscape, at least for the most extended individuals. That would be all the more concerning, since it could foreshadow pressure on the country\u2019s financial system. And it\u2019s a bit of a puzzle, given the economic backdrop has been positive, including an unemployment rate that\u2019s dropped to historically low levels. \nShrinking disposable income pushes more Canadians into debt\nMore than a third of Canadians have no retirement savings, half live paycheque to paycheque, poll finds\nWith the Bank of Canada on hold, watch our $2.19 trillion household debt load grow\n\u201cNormally there\u2019s a story you can tell, like there\u2019s some underlying weakness that shows up with a bit of a lag in personal bankruptcies and insolvencies,\u201d said Stephen Gordon, an economics professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to see that now. It\u2019s perplexing.\u201dInsolvencies are accelerating at a pace that\u2019s been associated with periods of distress: the start of the 2008-09 financial crisis, immediately before the 1990-92 recession, and during the period of pronounced economic weakness in 1995-96 that was tied to the Mexican peso crisis.The significance of the latest data is open to debate. For one thing, the insolvency numbers are at odds with other indicators that show a more benign environment for household debt. For instance, mortgage arrears were 0.23 per cent nationally at the end of July, close to the lowest they\u2019ve ever been, and delinquency rates on non-mortgage debt remain subdued.It's perplexingStephen Gordon, economics professor \n \nIn addition, a strong labour market, rising wages, interest rates that are lower than they were at the start of the year and a recovery in home prices all suggest borrowers should have more breathing room, not less.It\u2019s \u201chard to square\u201d the jump in insolvencies with that backdrop, according to David Tulk, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. \u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t a trend that would represent the average borrower, but is instead catching the fringe that have over-extended themselves,\u201d he said in an email.That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s downplaying the insolvency numbers, but rather they confirm his prior concerns about Canadian households. \u201cWhat I worry about more is that households use the retrenchment in rates to add even more leverage, and then we get an employment shock,\u201d he said.Brett House is more sanguine. While the latest surge in filings is \u201ca bit concerning\u201d given low unemployment and low interest rates, the deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto said \u201cthere are a number of important factors that temper the implications of the September print.\u201dFor one thing, the share of insolvencies to the total amount of household debt is falling. There were 5.3 filings for every $1 billion ($760 million) in total household debt as of September, versus 17.8 in 1997.Adjusting for population growth, the numbers also looks less dramatic. For instance, some 0.06 per cent of the Canadian workforce filed for insolvency, based on September numbers, versus 0.09 per cent a decade ago \u2014 though the rate has moved higher over the past 20 years.Tulk said he won\u2019t read too much into one month\u2019s worth of insolvency data. But if next month\u2019s print shows a further increase and if things look shaky elsewhere, \u201cI will be sufficiently nervy,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb153e7cbd');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb153e7cbd');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb153e7cbd'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Scott Deveau", "title": "Brookfield assets cross half a trillion dollars, helped by Oaktree", "description": "'As our cash generation continues to grow, we will need to decide if, when, and how to return capital to shareholders'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/brookfield-assets-cross-half-a-trillion-dollars-helped-by-oaktree", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/bruce-flatt.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 14, 2019 2:37 PM EST", "content": "Brookfield Asset Management Inc. said its assets swelled to more than half a trillion dollars at the end of the third quarter and it had over US$65 billion in capital available to continue its spending spree.Assets ballooned to almost US$511 billion after the Toronto-based alternative asset manager closed its purchase of a 61.2 per cent stake in Oaktree Capital Group at the end of the quarter.\u201cAll of this positions us well for the coming several years,\u201d Bruce Flatt, Brookfield chief executive officer said in a letter to investors Thursday with its quarterly results. \u201cAs our cash generation continues to grow, we will need to decide if, when, and how to return capital to shareholders.\u201d \nBrookfield deal could open door to international markets for Genworth MI Canada, analyst says\nBrookfield plans offer for majority stake in India\u2019s debt-laden Suzlon Energy\nBrookfield weighs bid for Iberian hydro assets owned by China Three Gorges\nThe company\u2019s next round of funds, including credit, should reach US$100 billion, he said.Brookfield shares reached a record high of $77.23 in Toronto and have gained 45 per cent this year for a market value of about $79 billion (US$60 billion).Low RatesInstitutional investors are increasingly looking to alternative assets managers, like Brookfield, with interest rates low and potentially going lower when a global slowdown occurs, Flatt said.With rates in Japan and Europe already in negative territory, Brookfield believes the world is in a new phase of global rates in a range of -2 per cent to 2 per cent for the next five to seven years, he said.\u201cThis is particularly relevant for us and will positively impact on all asset values and businesses that generate cash,\u201d he added.Fee-related earnings from the company before performance fees increased 35 per cent year over year, excluding the impact of the Oaktree acquisition, which closed at quarter end, Brookfield said.

Compensation per employee at the Toronto-based firm is up 18.6 per cent since fiscal 2007 when adjusted for nominal wage growth, according to company filings and calculations by Bloomberg. That\u2019s made Chief Executive Officer Darryl White\u2019s mission to improve efficiencies more difficult.Canada\u2019s biggest banks are more profitable than ever, with years of low interest rates and a stable economy fuelling record consumer borrowing, and strong housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto spurring demand for mortgages. Like their counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the firms are increasingly turning to technology and automation to drive down costs. \nAs boomers cash out of their businesses, the big banks are cashing in through deal financing\nRoyal Bank of Canada cracks Wall Street\u2019s top 10 list for advising on M&A deals\nCanadian banks brace for tougher times as \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 era winds down\nThat\u2019s good for the banks, but less beneficial for workers: Average compensation across the biggest Canadian lenders is down 1.8 per cent over 11 years. Canadian banks that have made big forays into the U.S., as well as other regions with high wages, are bucking that trend.Bank of Montreal, which owns Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, took over Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in 2011, U.K. fund manager F&C Asset Management in 2014 and a transportation-finance business from General Electric Co. the following year, and there have been additional capital-markets deals in the U.S. since. Those acquisitions have swelled Bank of Montreal\u2019s ranks \u2014 with higher-paid professionals to boot.The company, meanwhile, has been working to control its expenses. It\u2019s targeting an adjusted efficiency ratio \u2014 a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue \u2014 of 58 per cent or better by the end of fiscal 2021. In the third quarter, it was 59.9 per cent, the lowest in at least six years.\u201cOur bank-wide revenue per employee is among the highest in the Canadian banking sector and, as a consequence, our cost per employee is on the higher side as well \u2014 the two items are very much related,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an email. \u201cWe continue to make progress on improving the bank\u2019s overall efficiency.\u201dU.S. PurchasesIt\u2019s not the only Canadian bank whose compensation has swelled with U.S. acquisitions.Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s 5.4 per cent increase in per-employee pay came after the company spent much of the early 2000s expanding in U.S. retail banking, with takeovers of Banknorth Group Inc. in Maine, Commerce Bancorp Inc. in New Jersey and South Financial Group Inc. to expand in Florida and the Carolinas. Those acquisitions helped fuel a 65 per cent expansion in Toronto-Dominion\u2019s workforce between 2007 and 2018.Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s business mix has much to do with a 7.1 per cent increase in per-employee compensation since 2007. Growth in wealth management and capital markets over the past decade at the country\u2019s largest lender has topped expansion at Canadian rivals, which have smaller operations in those areas. A drive to be a Top 10 investment bank in the U.S. also boosted pay, since capital-markets compensation is higher in the country than in Canada.Pay hasn\u2019t been an issue for all Canadian banks expanding abroad. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, for example, is seeing the benefits of taking over Cambodia\u2019s Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd., a process that began in 2014 with the purchase of a 10 per cent interest and grew into a 90 per cent controlling stake by 2016. National Bank\u2019s per-employee compensation dropped 20.5 per cent over 11 years.\u201cThe explanation is essentially the growth of the number of employees we\u2019ve had in Cambodia, where the average salary is significantly lower than the Canadian average,\u201d CEO Louis Vachon said in an interview. \u201cIn 2014, we had 600 employees in Cambodia, and by the end of this year we\u2019ll be over 5,000.\u201dLower WagesNational Bank acquired the rest of ABA Bank in October. Employees in Cambodia, who now represent almost a quarter of the parent company\u2019s overall workforce, have an average annual compensation of around $10,000, compared with $110,000 for Canadian employees, according to the bank.At Bank of Nova Scotia, a 14 per cent decline in per-employee compensation came after the Toronto-based company boosted its employee base by two-thirds in the 11-year period. About 80 per cent of the additional workers are in international banking, in countries with lower wages than in Canada. Scotiabank has expanded with several Latin American acquisitions, including purchases in Chile, Peru and Colombia.\u201cOur footprint is what makes Scotiabank unique,\u201d spokesman Clancy Zeifman said, \u201cand more than half of our employees work outside of Canada.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo and Divya Balji", "title": "Brace yourself for bigger deficits and energy unease under a Trudeau minority", "description": "Investors and analysts weigh in on what to expect from a Liberal minority in parliament", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/canadian-election-2019-trudeau-minority-to-bring-bigger-deficits-energy-unease?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 22, 2019 11:05 AM EDT", "content": "Larger federal deficits, continued uncertainty for the energy sector and a potential push to reduce bills in the telco sector are in store for Canada after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term on Monday, investors and analysts say.Trudeau\u2019s Liberals were reduced to minority status in parliament and will need the support of other parties to push legislation through.

For bond investors, the companies do have the cash flow to meet their interest payment, he added.Deficits to Expand\u201cIn terms of economics you\u2019re going to see deficits increase. I think it will be a less popular destination for international funds, for money, for investing,\u201d said Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management. \u201cMy gut feel is we will see deficits, we will see less productive spending, less attractive environment to invest funds.\u201dThe Liberals pledged to increase the government deficit to $27.4 billion (US$21 billion) next year to fund new campaign promises, bringing it above 1 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2012.\u201cSignificantly larger\u201d budget deficits are expected given that the Liberals may need to rely on NDP support for some programs,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO.

The narrowing rate differentials between Canada and the U.S. lends support to the Canadian dollar, she said.Monetary policy has been the driver of economic growth in Canada, but now that rates are much lower they will be a lot less effective going forward, which means having effective fiscal policy is going to be much more critical than it was in the past, PIMCO\u2019s Devlin said.\u201cThe loonie, which is a gauge of what investors think, hasn\u2019t reacted much, which means markets were priced for this,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Toole, credit portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management, who helps manage $70 billion in fixed income, in Toronto. \u201cThere is still a sense from investors that Canada is still steady as it goes, it\u2019s got a sound government.\u201dTelcos ConcernAnother sector that could be impacted include telecommunications companies, Macquarie\u2019s Doyle said. The Liberal party\u2019s pledge to cut cellphone bills by 25 per cent could be supported by the NDP and Bloc Quebecois.During the election campaign, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party pledged to cut wireless services costs by 25 per cent within four years and the New Democratic Party also indicated that if elected, it would implement price caps on mobile phone and internet services that would save families about $10 (US$7.53) per month. The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association said last month that wireless prices have already dropped by about 30 per cent over the past three years.\u201cTrudeau\u2019s policy will weigh on telco companies, though I don\u2019t expect a big selloff,\u201d Manulife\u2019s Petursson said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Susanne Barton", "title": "How the election result could clip the wings of Canada\u2019s high-flying loonie", "description": "A trader\u2019s guide to Canada\u2019s tight election", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-minority-rule-a-traders-guide-to-canadas-tight-election?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 18, 2019 2:12 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s dollar is the best-performing major currency this year and the nation\u2019s stocks are going strong. But now isn\u2019t the time for investors to rest on their laurels. The upcoming federal election is the next big event to test the market\u2019s resilience.With less than a week left to the Oct. 21 vote, Liberal Party Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in a neck-and-neck race with Conservatives leader Andrew Scheer. While the most likely scenario is a government that doesn\u2019t command an absolute majority in its own right, some strategists say that a minority administration led by Scheer could be better for the loonie in the near term than one under Trudeau.\u201cBetween a Liberal-led minority and a Conservative-led minority, we expect the first one to be more CAD-negative,\u201d Francesco Pesole, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank, said in an Oct. 17 report. \u201cThe balance of risks for the loonie appears tilted to the downside.\u201d( function() { pnLoadVideo( \"videos\", \"PvPQMElSILM\", \"pn_video_30964\", \"\", \"\", {\"controls\":1,\"autoplay\":0,\"is_mobile\":\"\"} ); } )();The loonie has been in the No. 1 spot among Group-of-10 currencies this year, rising almost 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar amid a sound economy and a low unemployment rate. Canada\u2019s benchmark equity index has rallied 15 per cent in 2019, making it one of the top gainers among developed markets. It was little changed against the greenback Friday.A Conservative minority government would be better for market sentiment than a Liberal minority administration, according to Pesole. He said this is in part because it would likely exclude smaller parties that oppose more oil pipelines, a subject that has been a focus of political debate. \nThese are the tax proposals that could affect your bottom line this election\nThese are the election promises that could affect your personal finances\nJack Mintz: Unity of Canada's polarized regions will be the ultimate test for election winner\nA rebound in housing, solid economic growth and one of the strongest job markets in recent times has helped give Trudeau something positive to talk about during his campaign. While major central banks in other parts of the world have been cutting interest rates, the Bank of Canada has been reluctant to do so thus far \u2014 strengthening the Canadian dollar\u2019s position as one of the highest yielders among G-10 currencies.Michael Hsueh, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, says a Trudeau-led minority government could be negative for the Canadian dollar given the reduced capacity to pass legislation. It could also potentially hinder growth in oil, a key industry for Canada, one of the world\u2019s largest energy exporters.The Oil FactorStewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of the elections. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and has promised to remove regulations Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.The loonie, often seen as a petrocurrency, has benefited from the nation\u2019s massive oil exports. Still, bringing more oil reserves to market has divided Canadians \u2014 with two pipelines being scrapped on Trudeau\u2019s watch.Foreign-exchange strategists are concerned that a Trudeau-led government, propped up by other left-leaning parties, could be an obstacle in passing legislation favourable to business leaders and the country\u2019s energy sector.A Liberal minority government is \u201clikely to push for more regulation and rules on capital inflows into Canada,\u201d which could be negative for the Canadian dollar, Mark McCormick, global head of currency strategy at Toronto-based TD Securities, said in an email.Stock MarketWhile Canadian politics rarely play a significant role in the nation\u2019s equity market, a minority government could be positive for stocks, according to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\u201cAlthough on average the market has posted relatively strong performance post federal elections, there appears to be little to no performance preference around the outcome,\u201d he said in a September report. \u201cThe only potentially meaningful outcome appears to be a minority government versus a majority government.\u201dSince 1935, Canadian stocks have returned on average 12 per cent in the 12 months after the election of a minority government, compared with 8 per cent in the year following a majority victory, according to Belski\u2019s research.For others, volatility is the name of the game. Stripping out the global rout in 2008, National Bank Financial\u2019s Warren Lovely said that Canadian stocks had a \u201cmixed/choppy\u201d performance after a minority government was formed from 2004 to 2011.\u201cIn terms of capital markets, the formation of a minority government creates greater potential uncertainty \u2013 especially if a coalition government is the end result,\u201d Credit Suisse\u2019s equity analyst Andrew Kuske said in an Oct. 8 report.Still, election-related market moves might be short-lived this month with both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve reporting their monetary policy decisions on Oct. 30. Futures traders are pricing in almost no probability of a rate cut at the BOC meeting, while a quarter point reduction from the Fed is seen as likely by the market. Canadian two-year yields on Wednesday climbed above their U.S. equivalents by the most since 2017 \u2014 a good sign for loonie bulls.Trade deals will also have an impact on the Canadian dollar. The U.S. and China are still working to finalize their trade deal, which is likely to boost investors\u2019 appetite for risk, a positive for the currency. And on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC that he expects the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to be approved in Congress before the American Thanksgiving holiday.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson, Doug Alexander and Kevin Orland", "title": "David Rosenberg pegs Canada's recession odds at 80% in 'crude, condos and cannabis' economy", "description": "Some economists at Bloomberg's Canadian Fixed Income Conference say Canada won't be a bright spot in global economy for much longer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/david-rosenberg-pegs-canadas-recession-odds-at-80-in-crude-condos-and-cannabis-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadian-flag.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 17, 2019 2:07 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy has been a bright spot in the dimming global economy \u2014 but perhaps not for much longer, according to several bold calls at Bloomberg\u2019s Canadian Fixed Income Conference Wednesday.David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc., was the most bearish, putting odds of a recession in Canada at 80 per cent as slowing global growth swamps any fiscal stimulus ahead. He sees the Bank of Canada cutting interest rates four times as a result.\u201cThe way I look at the Canadian economy right now, it\u2019s really quite bifurcated,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cI call it the Triple C economy: there\u2019s crude, condos and cannabis.\u201d \nA fortune lies in the oilsands, but many voters want to leave it there\nCanadian business growing more frustrated as politicians focus on pocketbook issues over economy\nImproving job numbers, wages will keep fuelling our love of debt\nCanada has remained fairly resilient in the face of global weakness with rising immigration feeding labour market and wage gains, along with a rebounding housing market. But there are mounting concerns that it can\u2019t remain an indefinite holdout as the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown among trading partners take their toll.Rod Balkwill, executive director of Saskatchewan\u2019s Treasury Management Branch, said he sees a 60 per cent to 70 per cent risk of a recession, noting the housing market\u2019s strength is \u201cpretty narrowly based.\u201d Charles Allain, an executive director in Nova Scotia\u2019s finance department, said he\u2019s raised the odds substantially.\u201cThis time last year, I would\u2019ve said a very small potential of 10 per cent to 15 per cent,\u201d said Allain. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to think it\u2019s closer to 50 per cent now.\u201dThe consensus is that slower growth is on the horizon: economists expecting Canadian gross domestic product to decelerate to 1.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent last year. That\u2019s compared with 2.3 per cent forecast in 2019 for the U.S. from 2.9 per cent in the prior year.But predictions of recession were outliers at the conference. The probability of a recession was 25 per cent at the most recent Bloomberg survey of economists, compared with 35 per cent in the U.S.\u201cThe drivers of the economy continue to be our old friends of housing in particular coming back, but in terms of investment and trade we don\u2019t have a huge amount of optimism surrounding those sectors,\u201d said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, who sees a 30 per cent to 40 per cent chance.National Bank of Canada Chief Economist Stefane Marion concurred, saying the fundamentals that underpin the Canadian economy are still quite strong and inflation continues to hug the Bank of Canada\u2019s inflation target of 2 per cent.If a recession does come, it \u201ccould actually be a lot more severe than people think,\u201d according to David Wolf, part of the asset allocation team at Fidelity Investments Canada.\u201cThe reason for that is it\u2019s most likely to come from abroad,\u201d Wolf said, adding that it could result in Canada\u2019s first credit-cycle retrenchment since the early 1990s.Wolf said he\u2019s underweight the Canadian dollar and expects to see a \u201cpretty significant depreciation in the currency\u201d over the medium to long term.\u201cCanada actually stands out for us as being one of the more vulnerable economies despite what looks like a pretty good environment right now,\u201d Wolf said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jeff Kearns", "title": "The IMF cuts its global growth forecast for the fifth time in a row to the weakest in a decade", "description": "'The world economy faces difficult headwinds'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trade-woes-push-imf-global-growth-outlook-to-decade-low-of-3", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/imf-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 15, 2019 12:09 PM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund made a fifth-straight cut to its 2019 global growth forecast, citing a broad deceleration across the world\u2019s largest economies as trade tensions undermine the expansion.The world economy will grow 3 per cent this year, down from 3.2 per cent seen in July, with the 2020 estimate lowered to 3.4 per cent from 3.5 per cent, the fund said Tuesday in its latest World Economic Outlook.

Officials from around the world will convene as President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies remain one of the biggest global threats. Investors are awaiting more clarity on whether a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks last week will ease global uncertainties.The global growth estimate for 2019 was as high as 3.9 per cent in mid-2018. The IMF cited subdued economic momentum and weaker investment, slashing its estimate for the growth in trade volume to a \u201cnear standstill\u201d pace of just 1.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent last year, though it also sees a pickup to 3.2 per cent in 2020.The IMF report said \u201crisks seem to dominate the outlook,\u201d but recent monetary easing in many countries \u201ccould lift demand more than projected, especially if trade tensions between the U.S. and China ease and a no-deal Brexit is averted.\u201dThose threats and others have prompted warnings from both leaders of the global institutions as new leadership takes over. Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, previously World Bank chief executive officer, took over as IMF chief Oct. 1, succeeding Christine Lagarde. World Bank President David Malpass was selected in April.Georgieva painted a downbeat picture in her first major address last week, saying a deeper slowdown could require coordinated fiscal stimulus. She has said her first priority is to help member nations lower the risk of crises and cope with potential downturns.Business leaders are more circumspect too. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon also took a cautious tone on the global economy Tuesday, calling out trade tensions and geopolitical issues as the bank reported its third-quarter earnings.Growth EstimatesIMF economists dimmed their views across the largest economies. The fund cut its U.S. 2019 growth estimates by 0.2 percentage point to 2.4 per cent, but raised it by the same margin to 2.1 per cent next year.Euro-area growth was reduced this year and next, to 1.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent. Estimates for Germany, France, Italy and Spain were lowered for both years. This year\u2019s U.K. growth forecast was reduced to 1.2 per cent. China projections were reduced for both years, to 6.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively.The IMF says continued policy support in major economies and stabilization in some stressed emerging economies are expected to lift growth modestly over the rest of 2019 and into 2020.\u201cThe world economy faces difficult headwinds,\u201d the outlook said. \u201cDespite the recent decline in long-term interest rates creating more fiscal room, the global environment is expected to be characterized by relatively limited macroeconomic policy space to combat downturns and weaker trade flows, in part reflecting the increase in trade barriers and anticipated protracted trade policy uncertainty.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s real estate market seen in full recovery mode as sales and prices gain in September", "description": "Country's oil-producing regions the only ones showing any weakness", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-real-estate-market-is-in-full-recovery-mode", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 15, 2019 11:06 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s realtors produced another strong month of sales and prices in September, with gains in most major markets in a sign of strength for the nation\u2019s housing market.The number of units sold rose 0.6 per cent last month, extending a recent jump in activity that have seen transactions rise 16 per cent from a year ago, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday.

While the gains were all full-time, they were entirely public-sector positions and self-employed. Private sector jobs dropped by 21,000, with continued weakness in goods-producing industries.On the plus side, not only is employment growing, but so are wages. Hourly pay was up 4.3 per cent in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 3.7 per cent pace in August. The last few months have seen the strongest year-over-year increases in a decadeGet MoreTotal hours worked in September were up 1.3 per cent from a year earlier, from a pace of 1.2 per cent in August The economy added 70,000 full-time jobs in September, with part-time employment down 16,300. Canada has added almost 300,000 new full-time jobs this year One difference in the September report from recent trends is that most of the job gains reflected largely lower unemployment levels rather than rising labor force participation. The number of unemployed Canadians fell by 46,900 in September, while the labor force increased by just 6,800.

In July, the fund lowered its projection to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next year \u2014 its fourth downgrade since last October.The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdownIMF chief Kristalina Georgieva \n \nGlobal institutions, economists and investors are blaming the U.S.-China tariff conflict as a prime factor for slowing global growth. The trade tensions have partly caused manufacturing to tumble and weakened investment, creating a \u201cserious risk\u201d of spillover to other areas of the economy like services and consumption, Georgieva said in prepared remarks in Washington on Tuesday. Global trade growth is close to a standstill, she added. \n'Economic prosperity at risk': Business groups warn parties ignoring major challenges facing Canada \u2014 like a recession\nTrade war is plunging world growth to its lowest level since the financial crisis, OECD warns\n'Riddled with risk': Canada's economic growth threatened by geopolitical threats, report says\n\u201cThe global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,\u201d she said, noting that the fund estimates that 90 per cent of of the world is seeing slower growth. By contrast, two years ago, growth was accelerating across three-quarters of the globe in a synchronized upswing, she added.\u201cUncertainty \u2014 driven by trade but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions \u2014 is holding back economic potential,\u201d Georgieva said. Not only that, but the economic rifts could \u201clast a generation\u201d with possible shifts such as broken supply changes and siloed trade.\u201cThere is also in my view a risk of complacency,\u201d she said in an on-stage conversation with Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene in Washington following her speech. \u201cWe are decelerating, we are not stopping, and it\u2019s not that bad. And yet, unless we act now, we are risking a potential more-massive slowdown.\u201dThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development trimmed its forecast last month, while World Bank President David Malpass said Monday that the lender is preparing to downgrade its assessment from a projection of 2.6 per cent it made in June.A deeper slowdown would require more fiscal support, Georgieva said. \u201cIf the global economy slows more sharply than expected, a coordinated fiscal response may be needed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not there\u201d but it\u2019s better to be too early with it than late.On monetary policy, Georgieva said central banks should keep interest rates low where appropriate, \u201cespecially since inflation is still subdued in many countries and overall growth is weakening.\u201d She warned, however, that very low or even negative interest rates can come with \u201cnegative side effects and unintended consequences\u201d that can lead to financial vulnerabilities.\u201cMonetary and financial policies cannot do the job alone.

The moves will help trim the shortfall by as much as US$8 billion.GE\u2019s stubborn pension deficit, with added pressure from falling interest rates, has complicated Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp\u2019s efforts to put the Boston-based company on more stable ground. The CEO, who took the helm a year ago, has said debt remains one of the company\u2019s thorniest problems, alongside a slumping power business and lingering insurance liabilities. \nGE falls after Madoff whistleblower alleges its finances \u2018more serious than Enron or WorldCom accounting frauds\u2019\nHow did a global power house like General Electric fall so far, so fast?\nGE shares soar after CEO John Flannery ousted; Larry Culp takes helm\nThe efforts to reduce debt are encouraging, though a pension freeze is likely to damage employee morale, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said in a note. \u201cIn a situation of \u2018corporate battlefield surgery\u2019, this tends to be a typical, if unfortunate, casualty.\u201dThe pension changes, which will reduce GE\u2019s industrial net debt by as much as US$6 billion, follow similar moves by large companies including Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. as 401(k) retirement plans have gained favour.

Culp said last month at an industry conference that interest rates could create a US$7-billion headwind for the pension this year.The shares fell less than 1 per cent to US$8.55 at 10:24 a.m. in New York.

The risk premium on the company\u2019s 3.373 per cent bonds due 2025 tightened nearly 8 basis points to 145.6 basis points, according to Trace bond price data. The cost to protect its debt against default for five years fell 9 basis points to 131.8 basis points, according to ICE Data Services.Beginning in 2021, about 20,000 employees in GE\u2019s main U.S. pension plan will stop accruing new benefits, under the plans GE unveiled Monday. About 700 employees in a supplementary plan will also be affected. At that time, GE will contribute 3 per cent of eligible compensation to a 401(k) plan and will provide matching contributions of 50 per cent on as much as 8 per cent of eligible compensation.The company, which closed its pension plan to new entrants in 2012, said retirees already drawing pension benefits won\u2019t be affected. GE will offer a lump-sum payment to 100,000 eligible former employees who haven\u2019t started receiving their monthly pension payments.\u201cReturning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today\u2019s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\u201d GE\u2019s chief human resources officer, Kevin Cox, said in the statement. GE had 283,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year, including about 97,000 in the U.S.GE aims to reduce the net debt of its industrial businesses by US$25 billion, and Culp has said he wants to reduce GE\u2019s debt-to-earnings ratio to 2.5 times by the end of next year. The pension changes come several weeks after the company announced a US$5-billion debt tender.Since taking the helm in October 2018, Culp has been aggressive in his effort to fix the ailing company. He sold GE\u2019s biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp. for US$21.4 billion, divested a jet-leasing unit and unloaded part of GE\u2019s stake in Baker Hughes, easing investors\u2019 liquidity concerns.The portfolio changes have helped bring in about US$38 billion in new cash, giving the company funds for the pension moves.

The Financial Times first reported the cuts.The plan drawn up by HSBC\u2019s interim chief executive officer, Noel Quinn, envisages role reductions focused on the European and U.S. operations, which have been a drag on profitability at a lender that makes most of its money in faster-growing Asian economies. A spokeswoman for HSBC declined to comment.In August, John Flint was ousted as CEO of HSBC and replaced with Quinn in part because of his failure to get to grips with the bank\u2019s cost base. Quinn, working with Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson, began working on a cost-cutting plan immediately after his appointment, the person familiar with the matter said.Cutbacks were already on the rise after the London-based bank began encouraging managers to look for greater savings through a program known internally as Project Oak. That plan allowed managers to assign expenses incurred cutting jobs from their teams to a central account, rather than having to allocate the cost to their own budgets.Banks across Europe are cutting jobs as they struggle to deal with a combination of low interest rates and sputtering economies. Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale SA are among those shrinking their workforces.HSBC was relatively insulated from these pressures due to its outsized exposure to Asia.

It will continue to charge a fee of 65 US cents per contract for options trades.Double-WhammyAmeritrade is more exposed than its closest rivals because the company gets more than a third of its revenue from commissions in fees, said David Ritter, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\u201cIt\u2019s a double-whammy for them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the biggest of the big like Schwab, they\u2019re best able to absorb and monetize in other ways.\u201dWhile the San Francisco-based company, with about US$3.75 trillion of client assets, gets a majority of its revenue from net interest income, its decision to eliminate commissions comes at a perilous time because of historically low interest rates. Last month, the brokerage said it was cutting 600 jobs, or about 3 per cent of its workforce, citing \u201can increasingly challenging economic environment.\u201dSchwab\u2019s move also may prompt Ameritrade and E*Trade to reconsider a merger, Ritter said.Schwab previously doubled its suite of no-commission ETFs in March, bringing its total to more than 500 at the time. BlackRock Inc. iShares products were added to its platform, Schwab ETF OneSource, with 90 funds. Several fund issuers including State Street Global Advisors, Invesco Ltd., WisdomTree Investments Inc., J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. also planned to add to their commission-free offerings already on the platform.The cut to zero commissions is an inevitable industry trend that Schwab is trying to get ahead of, its Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford said in a separate statement Tuesday.\u201cWe are seeing new firms trying to enter our market \u2014 using zero or low equity commissions as a lever,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIt has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait.\u201dRobo-AdviceThe company last cut its retail trading commissions to US$4.95 from US$6.95 in February 2017, matching cuts by Fidelity. Since then, assets at the firm have grown by about US$800 billion from a combination of market gains and net new inflows.The brokerage can make up for lost revenue by offering advice to clients approaching retirement, said Alois Pirker, Aite Group\u2019s research director for wealth management.\u201cThey\u2019re looking at their client base and saying, \u2018what do our clients need right now?\u2019 They need advice and they need portfolios,\u201d Pirker said.Schwab has a range of advice offerings, from a free basic robo-advice platform to dedicated financial advisers, whose fees can start at 0.8 per cent of assets per year.For Schwab, offering free trades is the ultimate extension of its roots in the 1970s as a discount broker.\u201cEliminating commissions ensures my ultimate vision is realized \u2014 making investing accessible to all,\u201d Schwab\u2019s billionaire founder and Chairman Charles Schwab said in the statement.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "After best rally since 2000, Canadian stocks face a wall of worry", "description": "TSX expected to gain only 1.7% this year after the best start in almost two decades", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/after-best-rally-since-2000-canada-stocks-face-a-wall-of-worry?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tsx2_np2-e1494531193469.jpeg", "publishedAt": "October 1, 2019 10:25 AM EDT", "content": "The best start to the year since 2000 for Canada\u2019s stock market brought a surge of superlatives \u2014 fresh highs and record profit forecasts.Yet, expectations for the rest of the year are nowhere as rosy as the rally seen in the first quarter.

It could be last year\u2019s fourth-quarter sell-off that\u2019s prompting investor anxiety about a possible rehash this time around.

Half aren't on the S&P/TSX index\nExpectations that the Fed would cut rates had investors anticipating narrower interest margins from banks in the U.S. and Canada, and that sent their stocks lower, said Laura Lau, senior portfolio manager at Brompton Corp. Financials make up nearly 33 per cent of Canada\u2019s benchmark. Oil stocks, which account for more than 10 per cent of the gauge, have also been the pariahs of the market.After climbing more than 12 per cent at the start of the year, Canada\u2019s benchmark stock gauge gained less than 2 per cent in each of the two subsequent quarters. That\u2019s still the longest quarterly rally since March 2017.\u201cSeptember was an important inflection point for the TSX,\u201d said Tina Normann, technical research analyst at Eight Capital. \u201cThe composite broke out to new highs driven by financials. This coincided with the Canadian 10-year yield stabilizing along with most global yields,\u201d she said.Still, signs of fatigue were visible at the peak of benchmark\u2019s ascent. At its Sept. 20 high, the S&P/TSX Composite flirted with the overbought level and quickly slipped back down, snapping a four-week winning streak.In the U.S., traders are bracing for a big shock as downside options that expire within the next month become expensive.After suffering from a volatile third quarter, caution prevails ahead of more U.S.-China trade talks next week, the upcoming profit reporting season, federal elections where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is fighting for his political life and Bank of Canada\u2019s monetary policy decision. These events are slated for October alone.The sight of an inverting U.S. Treasury yield curve and President Donald Trump\u2019s relentless tweets about trade relations with China has put a shine on defensive and value stocks. Utilities, real estate and financials were among the top gainers in the third quarter and in September:\u201cOne thing is clear, we\u2019re definitely not going to be seeing interest rate hikes any time soon,\u201d John Goldsmith, head of Canadian equities at Montrusco Bolton said on BNN Bloomberg on Tuesday. \u201cThat definitely puts the onus on what\u2019s considered to be defensive sectors.\u201dEarnings season will be key to monitor the effects of slowing global growth and any spillover effects of the 18-month-old trade war. While profit estimates for companies listed on the Canadian benchmark have grown, the U.S. paints a different picture as CFOs have preemptively cut their forecasts at a rate not seen in three years.\u201cFour quarters of decelerating earnings may have reached a bottoming point primarily due to low interest rates and easier comparisons,\u201d Normann said. \u201cThis creates a path for stronger earnings growth in 2020.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Liberal promises would lead to four more years of deficits \u2014 each above $20 billion", "description": "That\u2019s despite new revenues including 3% tax on digital giants and luxury tax on $100,000 plus cars and boats", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/liberals-promises-new-spending-and-four-more-years-of-deficits-each-above-20-billion-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/justin-trudeau-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 30, 2019 10:39 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, fighting for his political life three weeks away from an election, is seeking a second mandate from voters to increase the nation\u2019s debt to deliver tax cuts and spending.In a costed platform released Sunday, the incumbent Liberals detailed a $57 billion (US$43 billion) plan over four years \u2014 worth about half a percent of annual gross domestic product \u2014 and pledged to pay for it with fresh borrowing, should they retain power.The plan represents a doubling down by Trudeau on deficit spending his team says is needed to stoke growth and provide struggling households, many of them with high levels of personal debt, with help.

The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada\u2019s budget would be back in balance.Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he\u2019s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.\u201cI will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity \u2014 if they really think so \u2014 are going to help Canadians,\u201d Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.Trudeau\u2019s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation\u2019s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory \u2014 but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That\u2019s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years\u2019 time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada\u2019s AAA credit rating.There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional C$2 billion as early as next year by undertaking \u201ca new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.\u201dThey also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion. It would take effect April 1 and be expected to raise more than $500 million next year. The Liberals also plan to impose a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars and boats worth more than $100,000.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Liberals promises new spending and four more years of deficits, each above $20 billion", "description": "That\u2019s despite new revenues including 3% tax on digital giants and luxury tax on $100,000 plus cars and boats", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/liberals-promises-new-spending-and-four-more-years-of-deficits-each-above-20-billion-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/justin-trudeau-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 30, 2019 9:43 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, fighting for his political life three weeks away from an election, is seeking a second mandate from voters to increase the nation\u2019s debt to deliver tax cuts and spending.In a costed platform released Sunday, the incumbent Liberals detailed a $57 billion (US$43 billion) plan over four years \u2014 worth about half a percent of annual gross domestic product \u2014 and pledged to pay for it with fresh borrowing, should they retain power.The plan represents a doubling down by Trudeau on deficit spending his team says is needed to stoke growth and provide struggling households, many of them with high levels of personal debt, with help.

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve pumped US$53.2 billion into the market to calm nerves and regain control over interest rates \u2014 its first intervention since the dark days of Lehman Brothers.\n\nCate Gillon/Getty Images\n\nThe whirlwind day left traders with a host of questions, including the big one: Now what? Shortly after 4 p.m., the Fed announced it would intervene with another repurchase operation on Wednesday.\u201cToday was a bit of a watershed event,\u201d said John Fath, managing partner at BTG Pactual Asset Management.Plumbing ProblemOvernight financing is a basic function, but it\u2019s so sensitive that many Wall Street dealers and corporate treasurers decline to talk openly about it. Privately, market participants likened the events of the past few days to to a plumbing problem \u2014 the result of forces that, for most people, are largely hidden from view.Unlike in 2008, Tuesday\u2019s abrupt rise in short-term rates wasn\u2019t evidence that the financial system was in trouble. Rather, it was the result of a confluence of forces, including corporate tax payments and big Treasury auctions and, ultimately, the swelling U.S. budget deficit. \nDavid Rosenberg: Get ready for the loonie and rates to fall, because our economy is sputtering\nWhy negative interest rates in the U.S. would be the real \u2018bonehead\u2019 move\nCanada, U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand only major bond markets now without negative rates \u2014 if they go, we\u2019re in trouble\nMark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Bank of America, saw it coming. He warned in a Sept. 13 note that the so-called dollar funding markets were about to be tested.Corporations had to withdraw cash from money market funds and bank accounts to make quarterly tax payments, while Treasury buyers had to settle up with Uncle Sam for recent purchases. On Friday alone, about US$20.4 billion flowed out of money-market funds, according to Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC.Such technicalities aside, the developments nonetheless showed the Fed was losing control over short-term lending, one of its tools for implementing the monetary policy that helps guide the entire economy.The market was so topsy-turvy that the effective fed funds rate rose, even as economists predict the central bank will reduce the benchmark at its policy-making meeting on Wednesday.The tumult also points to another worrisome sign: Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury bonds and bills that the Trump administration is using to fund a growing budget deficit. What\u2019s more, many dealers have curtailed trading because of reforms implemented after 2008, making markets more prone to volatility.Growing PressureTuesday\u2019s intervention marked the culmination of days of growing strains. Everyone knew pressure was building, said the head of rates financing at one major bank. But few expected a spike like this.By early Tuesday morning, dealers were whispering that the overnight repo rate would open at about 6 per cent, well above the 3.5 per cent where it had closed the night before.It was even worse than the dealers had feared \n \nAs usual, Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, was making daily calls to check that counterparties were executing transactions at the prevailing market rate. Some of them were quoting 3 per cent. Sabatino knew the clearing rate was much higher \u2014 between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.\u201cIt\u2019s normal price discovery, but now complicated when the market is in flux,\u201d he said.Then, at 7:38 a.m., the bid-ask spread flashed on dealing screens: 8 per cent \u2013 6 per cent.It was even worse than the dealers had feared.The message was clear: the Fed would have to step in like it used in the days before the financial crisis \n \nThe repo rate kept rising, eventually reaching as high as 10 per cent. By 9 a.m., a half hour before the stock market was to open, the fed funds rate was bumping up against the Fed\u2019s upper limit.The message was clear: the Fed would have to step in like it used in the days before the financial crisis. At 9:17, the Fed confirmed what everyone already suspected: it would conduct an overnight repurchase agreement operation from 9:30 to 9:45. The move would inject as much as US$75 billion of liquidity into the market.Then, messages began flying across Wall Street. Rumours swirled that the Fed operation had been abruptly canceled. Only this wasn\u2019t a rumour: the Fed was having technical problems.The timing was horrible. New York Fed President John Williams, senior vice president of market operations Lorie Logan and first vice president Michael Strine were all expected in Washington for the two-day central bank meeting.With anxiety growing, the Fed bumped the time to 10 a.m. Within 15 minutes, it injected US$53.2 billion, bringing rates back down, at least for a time.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked a worse day for this to happen,\u201d said Thomas Simons, senior economist at Jefferies LLC.It had been more than a decade since traders at the central bank jumped into U.S. money markets to add cash. And they seemed to get the reaction they wanted Tuesday morning, instantaneously driving down key short-term rates that had spiked, threatening to muck up everything from Treasury bond trading to lending to companies and consumers.But the move didn\u2019t last long.By the end of the trading session, rates were grinding back up, prompting Fed officials to fire off a second missive late in the day: They would be back Wednesday morning to offer another $75 billion of cash.With files from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Enda Curran", "title": "Oil-price shock couldn't come at a worse time for global economy in grip of deepening downturn", "description": "'A negative supply shock like this ... is just what we don't need'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-price-shock-couldnt-come-at-worse-time-for-world-growth?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/saudi-aramco-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 16, 2019 10:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record oil-price surge after a drone strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for a world economy already in the grip of a deepening downturn.While the severity will depend on how long the price spike endures, the development will further erode business and consumer confidence that already are fragile amid the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing global demand. A manufacturing slump around the world is hammering growth in export powerhouses China and Germany.\u201cA negative supply shock like this, when global growth is in a synchronized slowdown with many geopolitical hotspots simmering, is just what we don\u2019t need,\u201d said Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore. \nCrude prices jump most on record in the single worst sudden disruption to the oil market ever\nAttack on Saudi oil facilities knock out half the kingdom\u2019s supply, raises prospects of US$100 oil\nYemeni rebels promise more oil attacks to come, but \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 U.S. points finger straight at Iran\nThe oil shock comes amid a flurry of warning signs for the global economy. Data Monday out of China included the worst single-month reading for industrial output since 2002. In July, the International Monetary Fund reduced its global growth outlook \u2014 already the lowest since the financial crisis \u2014 to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent next; a rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009.Variable ImpactThe impact from the oil-price spike will vary around the world.Emerging economies nursing current account and fiscal deficits \u2014 like India, South Africa and others \u2014 run the risk of large capital outflows and weaker currencies.Exporting nations will enjoy a boost to corporate and government revenues, while consuming nations will bear the cost at the pump, potentially fanning inflation and hurting demand. As the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil, China is vulnerable to rising crude prices, while many countries in Europe also rely on imported energy.With inflation not an immediate concern in the global economy, the bigger worry is the effect a price shock will have on global demand that\u2019s already weak.\u201cInflation is not really an issue at the moment,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. \u201cBut the production shortage and price increase will choke purchasing power and thus weigh on spending at a precarious moment for the global economy.\u201dDovish Response?An IMF analysis in 2017 found that a one-year, one-standard-deviation shock to oil supply \u2014 in which the oil price jumps more than 10 per cent \u2014 would erode world output by about 0.1 per cent for two years.The news from Saudi Arabia boosts the chance of additional monetary policy support from central banks in anticipation of higher energy costs that are effectively a tax on consumers, David Mann, chief economist for Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television.\u201cWe would argue this adds to the reasons why we are going to see more dovish surprises from central banks over the next few weeks,\u201d Mann said.The Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates again this week and their meeting will be followed by the Bank of Japan, which is under pressure from investors to loosen monetary policy further.

Investments in private credit were virtually zero in 2006.

With concerns about a new global economic slowdown causing interest rates to plunge, and about US$15.6 trillion of global debt paying less than zero, it\u2019s increasingly urgent for portfolio managers to find new sources of returns.

This includes corporate, real estate and structured deals.While it\u2019s benefited CPPIB, Graham is cognizant of the risks, as demand leads to a deterioration in deal terms. Investors could also get saddled with losses if credit conditions sour and they can\u2019t unload under-performing assets.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing less and less liquidity across the board, and in some of these markets I\u2019m not sure if there is liquidity at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s a big issue is going to be very institution specific.\u201dCPPIB returned 1.1 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, as net assets grew $8.6 billion to top $400 billion for the first time.

The fund is looking to grow particularly in China, India and Brazil.

Wednesday\u2019s decision is a statement-only affair. The next day, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will give a speech in Halifax to provide more details on the central bank\u2019s deliberations around the decision. \nExpect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by the end of the year: David Rosenberg\nCanada, U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand only major bond markets now without negative rates \u2014 if they go, we\u2019re in trouble\nLook for a dovish Bank of Canada next week \u2014 with cuts coming soon, economists say\nSwaps trading suggests investors are fully pricing in a cut by December, with strong odds of a second by this time next year. Odds for a rate cut on Wednesday are less than 10 per cent.Even two cuts over the next 12 months would still leave Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies \u2014 raising the question of whether the domestic outlook truly justifies the northern nation\u2019s outlier status.While Canada\u2019s expansion is hardly remarkable, it stands out by virtue of having largely weathered the recent global slowdown. After a sluggish start to the year, growth in Canada accelerated to a strong 3.7 per cent annualized pace in the second quarter, giving it a very decent 2.1 per cent performance for the first half.Canada\u2019s housing market, meanwhile, is recovering; inflation is at target; and wage gains are accelerating. The Canadian data are hardly screaming rate cut.Nor are forecasts overly gloomy.Economists, including those at the central bank, continue to see growth averaging more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, which outside of the U.S. is as good as it gets in the Group of Seven.Of course, the Bank of Canada could mark down its forecasts for exports and investment, and the second-quarter GDP numbers also raised concerns about the underlying strength of consumption. But without a global recession, the base case will continue to call for half-decent growth, tempering the need for rate cuts.Risk ManagementYet, the one thing Poloz has practiced as governor is a reluctance to put too much weight on base case projections. He adopted a risk management framework in 2013 \u2014 well before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2014 that essentially moved the focus away from pinpoint forecasts to thinking about what could produce unexpected deviations. It\u2019s a play-it-safe strategy.When conditions were calling for rates to go up, risk management took the form of hyper data dependency. Policy makers were worried that more expensive credit could trigger an unwanted downturn so they were willing to go slow with hikes, waiting for the data to reaffirm their analysis.Now, with downside risks at the forefront and conditions suggesting cuts are in order, waiting may no longer be the best type of risk management strategy. Which is why Poloz, in the middle of the oil price shock in 2015, cut interest rates at the time.

The central bank of Denmark first cut its main rate below zero in 2012 to maintain the krone\u2019s peg to the euro. Seven years later, there\u2019s still no sign rates will turn positive. Recently, the chief executive of one of Denmark\u2019s biggest banks said he\u2019s girding for another eight years of negative rates. \nDiane Francis: When the next recession hits, we\u2019ll have a hell of a time clawing our way out of it\nBanks are now paying people to borrow money \u2014 and that\u2019s a really bad sign for the global economy\n\u2018The fog will not clear\u2019: Why another volley of tariffs, or tweets, could plunge the global economy into a recession\nBerg has previously spelled out all the ways in which negative interest rates are hurting the financial industry (with smaller loan losses marking a rare bright spot). Before negative rates, banks operated in a world in which deposit funding was cheaper than market funding. That world basically no longer exists.Earlier this month, Jyske Bank became the first in Denmark to announce it will start charging its wealthiest retail depositors, or those holding more than 7.5 million kroner US($1.1 million). But the country\u2019s biggest lender, Danske Bank, has said it won\u2019t do the same.In the \u201csurreal\u201d world in which interest rates are below zero, as Berg puts it, the people running Europe\u2019s banks need to come up with new ways to make money. That\u2019s especially true if retail clients react to negative deposit rates by withdrawing their cash.\u201cThere are financial stability threats for any significant transition in terms of how the structure of the system looks,\u201d he said by phone. It\u2019s \u201csimilar to what applies to any other industry. The textile industry also had to restructure itself at some stage.\u201d\u201cIf you continue to stay in this environment, something needs to give,\u201d Berg said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a conditional forecast that can be influenced in a benign way by management actions.\u201dIf you continue to stay in this environment, something needs to giveJesper Berg, director general of the Financial Supervisory Authority \n \nThe Danish bankers\u2019 association wants the central bank to look into easing the burden of negative rates on the financial industry by expanding a deposit facility that lets lenders park excess reserves at zero per cent. Berg says he won\u2019t join the debate because only the central bank can make that call.If more commercial banks end up passing on the cost of negative rates to their retail depositors, then people may start hoarding cash. That would put even more pressure on the financial industry to shrink. Berg also points out that the current benign business cycle has helped keep loan losses low, but that may change.\u201cWith higher provisions in a less benign phase of the business cycle, with pressure on net interest income, with pressure on fees, then the daily business would look less attractive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis applies across Europe, across large parts of the world, and obviously management will have to react.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte and Doug Alexander", "title": "Royal Bank of Canada pushes efficiencies, less risk at investment bank amid trading slump", "description": "Revenue at RBC Capital Markets fell to $2.03 billion in the fiscal third quarter, down 5.7 per cent from a year earlier", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/rbc-pushes-efficiencies-less-risk-at-investment-bank-amid-trading-slump", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/rbc-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 26, 2019 2:01 PM EDT", "content": "Royal Bank of Canada is looking to greater efficiencies while cutting down on risks in its capital-markets division as the pace of trading and dealmaking slows amid global economic uncertainties.Revenue at RBC Capital Markets fell to $2.03 billion (US$1.53 billion) in the fiscal third quarter, down 5.7 per cent from a year earlier and less than the second quarter\u2019s $2.17 billion.

Meanwhile, its ratio of compensation to revenue was at 37.9 per cent in the quarter, higher than the annual average over the past two years.The bank also is taking steps to reduce risks in its trading book. The average value at risk, a probabilistic measure of potential losses in a daily trading session, decreased to $23 million from $34 million at the end of April due to reduction of fixed-income inventories in the second quarter and lower market volatility in the first half of the year, a bank official said by email.RBC is further paring risks as more than US$16.1 trillion of bonds trade with a negative yield, while stock prices remain fairly lofty, meaning investors have to decide which market is correctly assessing economic and geopolitical developments. Inverted government yield curves in several developed economies suggest the chances of recession are increasing, even as investors keep bidding for new corporate bonds at historically low coupons.While investment-banking fees are down this year, Royal Bank \u201chas a strong investment-banking pipeline,\u201d including a number of \u201cmarquee deals,\u201d Bolger said.

It\u2019s looking more like a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Less than two decades ago, Argentina crashed out of an IMF program, defaulted on debt and plunged into depression. As Fund officials arrived in Buenos Aires over the weekend to assess the country\u2019s current $56 billion bailout \u2013- and decide whether to keep doling out cash \u2014 some of the same warning signals are flashing.President Mauricio Macri just got trounced by the populist opposition in a nationwide primary vote, after his IMF-backed program \u2013- based around budget austerity and the world\u2019s highest interest rates \u2014 failed to pull the economy out of recession.His defeat cued a market rout that was spectacular even by Argentina\u2019s standards of volatility. The peso slumped 20 per cent in a week, and yields on government bonds surged -\u2013 pushing the implied risk of default above 80 per cent. \nIn calls and emails, Argentine execs seek jobs abroad to escape crisis\nPeople in Argentina are pulling millions of dollars from the banks amid currency crisis fears\nArgentine peso ends higher after central bank sells dollars\nCough up?The IMF delegates, who arrived in Argentina on Saturday and immediately began meetings with policy makers, face a tricky choice with unwelcome echoes from two decades ago: risk making the turmoil even worse by withholding a $5.3 billion instalment due next month -\u2013 or cough it up, even though the program\u2019s future looks highly uncertain.They\u2019ll also have to figure out the economic plans of opposition chief Alberto Fernandez \u2013- who\u2019s likely to head a less market-friendly government. The IMF team will meet Fernandez\u2019s economic aides later on Monday. While elections are still two months away, Macri\u2019s 15-point primary defeat has led analysts to write him off as a lame duck.\u201cThe IMF has put a lot in \u2014 not just money, but prestige,\u201d said Hector Torres, a former executive director at the Fund who represented South American countries.\u201cThe fact that the arrangement is not performing well right now is an embarrassment,\u201d he said. And the September instalment is \u201cgoing to be a difficult call.\u201dUntil this month, Argentina was roughly on track to meet an IMF target of balancing the budget this year (excluding interest payments). The Fund may cite that performance in the first half of the year as grounds for handing over next month\u2019s payout, according to Priscila Robledo, Latin America economist at Continuum Economics in New York.\u201cThat\u2019s what I think will be the justification: \u2018Nothing happened at the end of June, we\u2019re all fine\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nIn this file photo taken on Aug. 11, 2019, presidential hopeful for the Frente de Todos party Alberto Fernandez gestures after voting during primary elections in Buenos Aires.\n\nALEJANDRO PAGNI/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Won\u2019t be met\u2019Since the ballot reverse, Macri\u2019s government has begun to loosen policy. It froze fuel prices and boosted subsidies, in an effort to shield the poorest Argentines as the peso\u2019s latest slide threatens to push inflation even higher.Fitch Ratings now predicts a primary deficit of 1 per cent, though the government still says it will meet IMF budget targets.\u201cThe Fund might say its evaluation going forward is that they won\u2019t be met,\u201d said Daniel Marx, who negotiated with the IMF two decades ago as Argentina\u2019s finance secretary, and now heads research company Quantum Finanzas in Buenos Aires. In that case, \u201cthe disbursement could be at risk.\u201dThe central bank could also breach IMF targets, as it burns through cash to defend the peso, Marx said. \u201cNow that they\u2019re starting to intervene in spot markets, that might affect net reserves.\u201dThe bank managed to steady currency and bond markets last week. But debt due after 2028 trades below 50 cents on the dollar \u2013- a potential red flag for the Fund.The Fund might say its evaluation going forward is that they won't be met \n \n\u2018No possibility\u2019The IMF has special criteria, which it tweaked after the Greek crisis, for jumbo loans like the one Macri got \u2013- and compliance is reassessed at each review. Two of them are key for Argentina right now: the Fund has to be satisfied that a borrower\u2019s debt is sustainable and that it has decent prospects of access to private capital.Judging by the markets, Argentina may struggle to meet those benchmarks. That opens a range of possibilities, including what the IMF calls \u201creprofiling\u201d \u2013- an extension of debt maturities, with few other changes \u2013- or the kind of restructuring brokered by the Fund for Ukraine in 2015, which involved haircuts too. IMF officials declined to comment for this story.Fernandez, who trumpets his experience working with the IMF as cabinet chief in the years after the 2001 crisis, insists that there\u2019ll be no replay. \u201cThere\u2019s no possibility that Argentina will fall into default if I\u2019m president,\u201d he said on Wednesday.Fernandez has been vague about policy commitments and says talks with the IMF are Macri\u2019s responsibility while he\u2019s president. The opposition chief has said the program must be revised to allow Argentina to grow again.\u2018Some form of haircut\u2019He\u2019ll likely start by arguing that Argentina, with bills coming due to private creditors too, will need more time to repay the Fund, said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management in New York, which oversees about $6 billion.\u201cFernandez\u2019s first request will be to reschedule,\u201d Esteruelas said. If a deal can\u2019t be hammered out, \u201cprivate sector debt holders would have to take some form of haircut.\u201dOrdinary Argentines also have traumatic memories of failed IMF programs. Many blame the Fund for the epic collapse of two decades ago, one reason why Macri\u2019s decision to go to the IMF last year was so risky.Late in 2001, after a series of missed budget targets and re-upped IMF loans, the government announced it was preparing to restructure debt. Argentines rushed to the banks to pull their money out \u2013- and found their deposits had been frozen by authorities, an event known as the \u201ccorralito.\u201dA week later, the IMF finally pulled the plug, declining to disburse more funds. Mass protests erupted, leading to dozens of deaths. The political system convulsed, with four presidents succeeding each other in the space of a month. In the longer run, Argentina was frozen out of world markets for over a decade, and millions saw their savings wiped out.Read More: Argentina\u2019s Decades-Long Boom-to-Bust Curse Claims a New Victim\u2018The bank\u2019s problem\u2019Most analysts say things aren\u2019t that dire today \u2013 including Alberto Ramos, who was on the IMF\u2019s last trip in 2001 as an economist.Argentina has done a better job this time of sticking to its program, and \u201cwithout the IMF we would be talking about a much more difficult situation\u201d said Ramos, now chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs. But he said the country\u2019s turbulent history means there\u2019s always a risk of social panic. \u201cThat\u2019s another layer of difficulty to this.\u201dAnother one is the prospect of an extended transition of power. There\u2019ll be a four-month gap between the Aug. 11 primary and the swearing-in of a new government. And the Fund has its own leadership vacuum: Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief who signed off on Argentina\u2019s loan, is in transit to the European Central Bank and may not be replaced for weeks.\u201cThe IMF is in a serious pickle,\u201d said Esteruelas. \u201cIt reminds me of the saying: If you owe the bank $100, it\u2019s your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, it\u2019s the bank\u2019s problem.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Nir Kaissar", "title": "In elevated market, Warren Buffett is missing from the chatter.

Interest rates have reached a permanent low. U.S. stocks have reached a permanent high. FAANG stocks will rule markets for all time. Value investing is dead.During previous bouts, Warren Buffett, America\u2019s patron saint of investing offered his sage \u2014 and inevitably unpopular \u2014 perspective. When the dot-com mania raged in the late 1990s, he famously warned against chasing internet stocks. And during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he implored investors not to give up on U.S. stocks. Of course, neither episode turned out to be different from the innumerable ones that preceded it, at least when it comes to investing.This time, Buffett has been uncharacteristically missing from the chatter, but that doesn\u2019t mean his views are any less clear, or any less worth paying attention to. \nJust what is Warren Buffett getting up to in Europe?\nBill Ackman pays ultimate homage to idol Warren Buffett with $686-million bet on Berkshire Hathaway\nWarren Buffett admits he was an \u2019idiot\u2019 for not buying Amazon earlier as Berkshire acquires stake\nLet\u2019s start with Buffett\u2019s favourite stock market barometer, the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. As its name suggests, it measures the total value of the stock market as a percentage of GDP. In simple terms, a lower ratio is bullish and a higher one is bearish.The ratio was prescient during the last two downturns. It shot up to 146 per cent at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, a record at the time and well above its average of 89 per cent since 1975, according to numbers compiled by the World Bank. It peaked again at 137 per cent just before the financial crisis in 2007. Where is the market cap-to-GDP ratio now? It notched a fresh high of 154 per cent in 2017, according to the latest available number, and is almost certainly higher today given that the U.S. stock market is up roughly 7 per cent since the end of 2017.So it\u2019s probably safe to say that Buffett doesn\u2019t love the lofty level of the stock market. And judging by the record US$122 billion of cash he\u2019s hoarding at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it\u2019s also safe to assume he doesn\u2019t expect the market to remain elevated forever. Buffett\u2019s cash pile is more than half the value of Berkshire\u2019s US$208-billion portfolio of public companies, and since 1987 his cash allocation as a percentage of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio was only higher in the years leading up to the financial crisis.At the same time, the few stocks that do appeal to Buffett suggest his faith in value investing is unshaken despite a miserable decade of underperformance for the strategy. Roughly 45 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s stock portfolio is allocated to the financial sector, and eight of the portfolio\u2019s top 12 holdings are financial stocks \u2014 a deeply contrarian bet. The sector has been hampered for much of the last decade by tighter regulation and low interest rates. While profits have picked up recently, many investors fear that a prolonged period of low rates will keep a lid on profits for the foreseeable future.\n\nWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway attends the annual Berkshire shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2019.\n\nJOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs a result, the financial sector has been one of the cheapest sectors by most measures for years. It\u2019s still the most represented sector in many value indexes, including a 21 per cent allocation in the S&P 500 Value Index and 23 per cent in the Russell 1000 Value Index. That\u2019s apparently not enough for Buffett, whose allocation to the sector is double that.Much has been made of Buffett\u2019s uncharacteristic pivot to technology stocks in recent years, but that, too, is mostly a value play. Apple Inc. makes up nearly 90 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s 27 per cent allocation to the technology sector. When Buffett began buying Apple in early 2016, it was a bona fide value stock. It boasted an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, and an average price-to-cash flow ratio of 7.5 during the first quarter of that year, well below the S&P 500\u2019s P/E ratio of 19.5 and P/CF ratio of 10.9. Apple is pricier today, but it\u2019s still the largest name in the S&P 500 Value Index, with a hefty 8.3 per cent allocation.Buffett has said that he regrets passing on Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. when the companies were younger, but don\u2019t mistake the maestro. The fact that he isn\u2019t loading up on them today, despite having plenty of cash to do so, speaks volumes. Amazon trades at a jaw-dropping P/E ratio of 73 and Alphabet at 27, which is the furthest thing from value. Buffett already has a small 0.5 per cent allocation to Amazon on the recommendation of one of his deputies. Don\u2019t count on him making meaningfully more room for Amazon or Google at current prices.For now, Buffett is paying a price for his dissent.\u00a0 Berkshire\u2019s return trailed the S&P 500 by 0.9 percentage points a year from 2009 to 2018, including dividends. It\u2019s not the first time. Buffett lagged the market by 3.2 percentage points a year around the Nifty Fifty craze from 1971 to 1975 and by 6.1 percentage points a year during the dot-com boom from 1995 to 1999.Still, Berkshire\u2019s portfolio remains unabashedly Buffett: big profits at a reasonable cost. The portfolio has a weighted-average return on capital of 12 per cent, compared with just 7.9 per cent for the S&P 500. And it\u2019s far cheaper. Buffett\u2019s portfolio has a P/E ratio of 16.5, based on 12-month trailing operating earnings per share, compared with 21 for the S&P 500.There\u2019s little indication, in other words, that Buffett is wavering from his long-standing investing principles. It\u2019s a timely example, even if Buffett is no longer eager to say so.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ranjeetha Pakiam", "title": "Gold could hit $1,600 within three months, UBS says", "description": "Gold is proving its worth as a haven this year as China and the U.S. trade blows, with a significant escalation on Friday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/ubs-says-its-staying-long-gold-with-prediction-price-may-hit-us1600-within-three-months?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gold3333.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 26, 2019 9:24 AM EDT", "content": "Gold will extend its winning ways as the U.S.-China standoff harms growth, risking a deeper slowdown and inviting more central-bank easing, according to UBS Group AG, which jacked up price forecasts with a prediction the precious metal may hit US$1,600 within three months.\u201cThe trade war between the U.S. and China has escalated to a new level,\u201d Giovanni Staunovo and Wayne Gordon, analysts at the wealth-management unit, said in a report received on Monday.\u201cGold has demonstrated its safe-haven qualities and we stay long the metal, a trade we initiated in mid-May.\u201d \nDividend stocks are being touted as a substitute for bonds, but the reality is much more complicated\nRecession talk is growing.

But he had other ways to increase pressure, Pillsbury added, including giving the final green light to sales of F-16s to Taiwan that have been signed off on by the State Department. The administration has notified Congress it intends to go ahead with the sale.Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has also advised the administration, agreed that an increase in tariffs was the most likely course of action, though it could be staged to give China more time to respond.Trump\u2019s order to U.S. companies to abandon China would mean very little in the short-term, Scissors said. But the president does have other ways he could increase pressure on U.S. companies to stop doing business with China, particularly if he chose to invoke a national security emergency and ban tech companies from selling certain products to Chinese buyers.\u201cIt\u2019s worth the market being a little nervous that U.S. tech companies are involved with China and that they are providing China with dual-use technologies,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the hawks are angry about. So the president can take action against those companies not by \u2018I hereby order,\u2019 but by starting a process where the direct pressure on them goes up.\u201dChina\u2019s newest tariffs came earlier Friday in retaliation for Trump\u2019s latest planned levies on Chinese imports, which have pushed U.S. stocks and commodities lower. The move takes aim at the heart of Trump\u2019s political support \u2014 factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time when the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing.Trump reiterated his criticism of the Fed after Powell\u2019s remarks were released earlier Friday morning: \u201cMy only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u201d Trump said in one of his tweets, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\u2026.My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019The news from Beijing rekindled concerns about the world\u2019s two largest economies and a global growth outlook that\u2019s already looking shaky.Some of the Chinese countermeasures will take effect starting Sept. 1, while the rest will come into effect from Dec. 15, according to the announcement from China\u2019s Finance Ministry. This mirrors the timetable the U.S. has laid out for 10% tariffs on almost $300 billion of Chinese shipments.China will put an extra 5 per cent tariff on American soybeans and crude-oil imports starting next month. The resumption of a suspended extra 25 per cent duty on U.S. cars will resume Dec. 15, with an additional 10% on top for some vehicles. With existing general duties on autos taken into account, the total tariff charged on U.S.-made cars would be as high as 50 per cent.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called China\u2019s move \u201cunfortunate but not unexpected.\u201d\u201cThe fact of the matter is that nobody wins a trade war, and the continued tit-for-tat escalation between the U.S. and China is putting significant strain on the U.S. economy, raising costs, undermining investment, and roiling markets,\u201d Myron Brilliant, the chamber\u2019s head of international affairs, said in a statement.After Trump gave the go-ahead earlier this month for tariffs on the almost $300 billion in Chinese imports that haven\u2019t been hit by higher duties, China halted purchases of agricultural goods and allowed the yuan to weaken.Possible ActionsOther than possibly raising the tariffs set to kick in Sept. 1, it isn\u2019t clear what action Trump might take. Inside the White House, hawks have been pushing for a direct intervention in currency markets by the Treasury by pointing to a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing, which many economists have blamed on tariffs imposed by Trump and uncertainty surrounding his trade war with China.Just how effective a Fed cut or an intervention would be is unclear. The relevant Treasury fund has US$92 billion in it. Even if the Fed were to join in, as it has in past interventions, and match that amount, a US$180 billion injection into a $5 trillion per day global foreign-exchange market might have a limited effect. It might also unnerve markets and have longer-term economic consequences.Beyond that, the administration could raise further barriers to Chinese investment in the U.S. or target China\u2019s energy supply by revoking waivers that allow Beijing to continue purchasing oil from Iran and Venezuela. Trump could also take steps to further isolate Huawei Technologies Co., which the U.S. deems a security threat, in its bid to supply 5G technology in the U.S. Or, Trump could take a harder line against Beijing over human rights and the autonomy of Hong Kong, where protests have raged for weeks.Fentanyl OrderU.S. and Chinese negotiators have spoken by phone and are planning another call in coming days. People familiar with their intentions previously said that the Chinese delegation is sticking to their plan to travel to the U.S. in September for face-to-face meetings, which may offer a chance for further reprieve.Trump also ordered mail carriers to search for deliveries of the drug fentanyl coming from China.\u201cAlso, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE\u201d deliveries of the illegal drug. It isn\u2019t clear what the carriers\u2019 responsibilities are in halting those shipments, which have helped fuel an opioid epidemic in the U.S.\u2026.all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop \u2013 it didn\u2019t. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019Stopping shipments of illegal fentanyl that enter the U.S. is a job that typically falls to government agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, Food and Drug Administration and Customs and Border Protection.Illegal Chinese fentanyl is increasingly entering the U.S. through the Mexico border via drug traffickers instead of being sent directly. It\u2019s unclear if Trump also wants to stop legal fentanyl, often used by cancer patients to treat pain, from entering the U.S. as well, which would cause an outcry from patients.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres and Rich Miller", "title": "Fed's Jerome Powell says U.S. economy in favourable place but faces 'significant risks'", "description": "'Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/feds-jerome-powell-says-u-s-economy-in-favourable-place-but-faces-significant-risks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/powell-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 23, 2019 10:42 AM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is in a favourable place but faces \u201csignificant risks\u201d as growth abroad slows amid trade uncertainty.\u201cTrade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States,\u201d Powell said in the text of his remarks Friday to central bankers gathered at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \u201cWe will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labour market and inflation near its symmetric 2 per cent objective.\u201dCiting slowing global growth and muted inflation, the Fed cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than a decade, reducing its target range by a quarter-percentage point to 2 per cent-2.25 per cent. Powell described the rate reduction at the time as \u201ca mid-cycle adjustment to policy,\u201d telling reporters on July 31 that it wasn\u2019t the beginning of a long series of cuts. \nFed saw its July rate cut as insurance for growth and inflation, minutes show\nCanadian inflation holds steady in July, giving Bank of Canada one less reason to cut rates\nG7 leaders are too busy squabbling to do anything about a world economy teetering toward recession\nBut in his remarks Friday, he noted that events since that meeting \u201chave been eventful.\u201d\u201cWe have seen further evidence of a global slowdown, notably in Germany and China. Geopolitical events have been much in the news, including the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong Kong, and the dissolution of the Italian government,\u201d Powell said, also mentioning another salvo in President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which was matched by new countermeasures by that nation earlier Friday.\u201cIn principle, anything that affects the outlook for employment and inflation could also affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that could include uncertainty about trade policy,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThere are, however, no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.\u201dInvestors have fully priced in another quarter point reduction when the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 17-18, according to federal funds futures contracts. Powell\u2019s remarks suggest the committee remains in heightened risk-management mode.\u201cWe are carefully watching developments as we assess their implications for the U.S. outlook and the path of monetary policy,\u201d he said.Powell\u2019s remarks examined U.S. monetary policy since the Second World War. He broke the analysis into three long-run questions: Can the central bank restrain inflation? Can the central bank buffer inevitable financial excess? Can the central bank still provide stimulus and counter-cyclical policy in a time of very low interest rates?He answered the first two positively, saying that the Fed has the tools to quell inflation, while the post-crisis financial system is more resilient and monitoring has improved. Answers on the third question are a work in progress, he said.\u201cOur economy is now in a favourable place, and I will describe how we are working to sustain these conditions in the face of significant risks we have been monitoring,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "CIBC shares surge on profit beat in U.S. unit", "description": "Shares surged the most in more than 20 months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/cibc-profit-beats-on-strength-in-retail-commercial-banking-units", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/cibc-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 22, 2019 10:23 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\u2019s shares surged after third-quarter results showed its U.S. operations and higher revenue lifted profit above analysts\u2019 estimates.The company\u2019s commercial-banking and wealth-management division in the U.S., which includes the PrivateBank operations CIBC acquired two years ago, was the quarter\u2019s best-performer, with a profit jump of 6.2 per cent.

Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig told investors in May that earnings this year would be \u201crelatively flat\u201d partly due to higher spending. The positive results out of the U.S. helped counter a 13 per cent decline in CIBC\u2019s capital-markets business and a 1 per cent drop in Canadian commercial banking and wealth management.\u201cOur commercial banks continue to perform exceptionally well,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said in a phone interview. \u201cTheir loan and deposit growth is very strong and they continue to be very well managed.\u201dProfit at Canada\u2019s fifth-largest lender was $1.4 billion (US$1.1 billion) for the period ended July 31, with adjusted earnings of $3.10 a share, the Toronto-based lender said Thursday in a statement, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by four cents. CIBC raised its quarterly dividend 2.9 per cent to $1.44 a share. Shares of the bank rose as much as 3.3 per cent to $102.74 in trading in Toronto.Loan ProvisionsStill, CIBC saw continued weakness in its domestic mortgages and rising loan-loss provisions even as larger rival Royal Bank of Canada posted improvements in those areas for the three-month period.CIBC once had enviable mortgage growth, trouncing other banks with 12 per cent year-over-year gains through 2017 \u2014 until the pendulum started to swing the other way at the end of last year. The domestic mortgage book contracted for the third straight quarter with C$201 billion in balances, down 1% from a year earlier.Investors and analysts have been watching for signs of deteriorating loans since short sellers earlier this year said that CIBC and other banks are ill-prepared for worsening credit conditions. CIBC set aside $291 million for soured loans in the quarter, up from C$255 million in the previous three months and 21 per cent more than a year earlier \u2014 and higher than analysts expected.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with our portfolios and think that they\u2019re performing extremely well,\u201d Glass said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing from a systemic basis that gives us pause.\u201dJames Shanahan, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said he sees \u201cbroader concerns\u201d about credit quality. \u201cElevated credit costs and increased impairments in the business-loan portfolio are more concerning and offset what is a modest beat,\u201d Shanahan said in an interview.Other key takeaways:CIBC defied analysts\u2019 pessimistic expectations quarter after quarter for almost four years, until missing estimates in the fourth quarter of 2018 \u2014 and subsequent periods since. CIBC broke that streak in the quarter ended July 31.Net interest income was $2.69 billion, up 4.5 per cent and rebounding from a slowdown earlier in the year.The bank also announced that CFO Glass will step down Oct. 31 to be replaced by Hratch Panossian, currently executive vice president, global controller and investor relations.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Royal Bank of Canada profit misses on weak equity trading", "description": "RBC had $653 million in profit from RBC Capital Markets, a 6.4 per cent decline", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/royal-bank-of-canada-profit-misses-on-weak-equity-trading", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/rbc-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 21, 2019 10:21 AM EDT", "content": "Royal Bank of Canada posted fiscal third-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, hurt by a slowdown in the company\u2019s capital-markets division.Canada\u2019s largest lender by assets had $653 million (US$491 million) in profit from RBC Capital Markets, a 6.4 per cent decline, the result of lower trading revenue and a drop in investment-banking fees, according to a statement Wednesday.

Yet Canadian personal-and-commercial banking remains the company\u2019s biggest division. The operation posted a 7.9 per cent jump in earnings to a record $1.61 billion, representing almost half of overall profit at the bank. Wealth-management earnings rose 11 per cent to $639 million.The Toronto-based lender saw improvements in two areas of concern for investors and analysts: expenses and provisions. Growth in non-interest expenses cooled after three quarters of accelerated growth as the bank invested in technology and spent more on hiring, marketing and new initiatives. Still, costs reached a record $5.99 billion, up 2.3 per cent from a year earlier.\u201cAs the revenue headwinds might be picking up, given the interest rate outlook, we saw that we needed to slow that rate of growth,\u201d Bolger said. \u201cWe expect to continue to grow expenses, albeit at a much slower rate than what we\u2019ve been growing over the last couple years.\u201dRoyal Bank has been facing elevated levels of provisions and impaired loans this year, notably in its wholesale lending portfolio in areas such as the U.S. oil-and-gas industry. In the third quarter, the bank set aside $425 million, little changed from the previous quarter and up 20 per cent from a year earlier.Royal Bank\u2019s shares were little changed at $99.44 at 9:51 a.m. in Toronto. The stock has risen 6.4 per cent this year, outperforming the 4.4 per cent gain for the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Separately, Royal Bank said that Doug McGregor, group head of RBC Capital Markets and RBC Investor & Treasury Services, will retire on Jan. 31 after 37 years at the bank. Derek Neldner, global head of investment banking at RBC Capital Markets, will become group head of capital markets effective Nov. 1, while Doug Guzman, who oversees wealth management and insurance, will take over Investor & Treasury Services.Other takeaways from the bank\u2019s quarterly results:The company routinely expands mortgage balances by about 5 per cent each quarter, topping growth at its rivals. Domestic mortgage balances rose 5.9 per cent to $257.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter.Most Canadian banks increase their quarterly dividends twice a year. Royal Bank stuck to that tradition, boosting its payout 2.9 per cent to $1.05.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jordan Fabian and Laura Davison", "title": "Trump says the U.S. is 'very far from a recession' but floats stimulus ideas anyway", "description": "Trump said he's open to a range of possible actions, including a payroll tax cut or bypassing Congress to reduce taxes by indexing capital gains", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-says-the-u-s-is-very-far-from-a-recession-but-floats-stimulus-ideas-anyway?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/trump-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 21, 2019 8:52 AM EDT", "content": "President Donald Trump has consistently rejected a growing number of forecasts that his trade war with China and slowing global growth are pitching the U.S. economy toward recession.

Bush in 1992, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Herbert Hoover in 1932.For Trump, the economy may be even more important than for his predecessors. His low-40s approval rating is already perilous for an incumbent, and the economy is the main factor keeping him afloat. He scores poorly on most other policy issues and on questions of leadership and character.\u201cI think the word recession is a word that\u2019s inappropriate \u2019cause it\u2019s just a word that certain people \u2014 I\u2019m going to be kind, certain people and the media are trying to build up, because they\u2019d love to see a recession,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.Yet, when asked about the economy, the president said he and his advisers have discussed \u201call types of options,\u201d including the payroll tax cut, which supports Social Security and Medicare.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at various tax reductions\u201d but the White House does that \u201call the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about doing anything at this moment.\u201dMy life would be a lot easier if I hadn't taken China on. But I like doing it because I have to do itU.S. President Donald Trump \n \nWhite House officials say the president has decided against cutting payroll taxes for now. One person familiar with the internal discussions said the idea had been floated by Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, but that even the suggestion of it had caused others to bristle. They said it would send a message to the outside world that the administration is worried about the state of an economy that Trump continues to insist is strong.While the president remains bullish, he and his economic advisers have been casting about for ways to cut taxes to foster growth amid troubling signs. Business investment is cooling and manufacturing has weakened. U.S. factory activity deteriorated in July to an almost three-year low, according to the latest figures from the Institute for Supply Management.This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has suggested sweeping tax cuts while facing political headwinds. Before the mid-term elections last fall, he floated a 10 per cent middle class tax cut \u2014 much to the surprise of his own aides and allies in Congress. He never released any specifics about the cut, and after Republicans lost control of the House in the election, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the idea was no longer being pursued.Any new Trump tax cut plan is not likely to be welcomed on Capitol Hill. The Constitution mandates that tax legislation originate in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi will refuse to consider bills that could buoy the re-election chances of the president and his party.Even congressional Republicans are hesitant to put forward tax cut legislation, worried that would suggest that the economy is faltering heading into the 2020 campaign season.\u201cAt this point, recession seems more of a political wish by Democrats than an economic reality,\u201d Michael Zona, a spokesman for Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in an email.Major tax cuts all require congressional approval, but Trump, along with top advisers including Kudlow, believe that he can index capital gains to inflation without Congress, a move that would cut taxes for investors. White House officials are looking at using an executive order to direct the Treasury Department to issue regulations adjusting the original purchase price of an asset \u2014 such as a stock or real estate \u2014 upward with inflation, minimizing the \u201cgain\u201d on which an investor is taxed.Treasury Department officials are skeptical that this can be done without Congress and are concerned it could face legal challenges.Such an action would also do little to stave off a potential slowdown or curry favour with voters. Indexing capital gains would only expand the economy by about 0.11 per cent in the long-run, according to the Tax Foundation. And very few people outside the top 5 per cent of earners, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, have capital gains income allowing them to to take advantage of the break.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Fergal O'Brien and Piotr Skolimowski", "title": "Recession warnings are piling up for the battered global economy", "description": "Today bond markets sent their biggest recession warnings since the financial crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/recession-warnings-pile-up-for-the-battered-global-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/dollar3.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 14, 2019 8:21 AM EDT", "content": "Another day, another round of bad news highlighting the risk that the global economy is headed for a serious downturn.China reported the weakest growth in industrial output since 2002.

That\u2019s counter to the expectation of markets, where forward rates point to some easing over the same period.The surprising robustness of the domestic economy may be keeping the bulk of analysts in the more hawkish camp. As global trade uncertainty mounts, key Canadian indicators continue to beat expectations \u2014 including back-to-back trade surpluses \u2014 with growth in the second quarter tracking faster than expected. \nCanada loses 24,200 jobs in July, pushing unemployment rate higher\nCanadian housing starts decline 9.6% in July on multi-unit drop\nWhy strategists are so bullish on Canadian stocks, even in the midst of a trade war\n\u201cPoloz will need to see a substantial weakening in domestic data before the bank changes its stance,\u201d Dominique Lapointe, an economist at Laurentian Bank, said by phone from Montreal. \u201cThe extent to which global tensions translate into lower business investment and exports in Canada has yet to be seen.\u201dOf the 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, nine expect the Bank of Canada to remain on hold to the end of 2020. Domestic banks are among the more optimistic \u2014 with Toronto Dominion, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, National Bank and Laurentian expecting Poloz to hold well into next year.But not all are convinced, with six analysts predicting at least one cut amid escalating U.S.-China trade tension that is raising doubts about the global growth outlook, and which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week.Trade and investment are most at risk for Canada. While underlying export strength is at its strongest since 2015, evidence of slowing global demand is mounting. Inventory-to-sales ratios are at recession-era highs in both the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, and leading indicators for Canadian exporters are deteriorating. Signs are also emerging that the nation\u2019s red-hot labor market is cooling off.Royal Bank of Canada expects Poloz to cut rates in the first quarter of next year, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce moving their call ahead to that same period earlier this week. Capital Economics, meanwhile, expects the central bank to lower its benchmark to 1 per cent by the end of 2020.Yet, there are plenty of arguments in favour of a hold. Canada\u2019s economy in the second quarter probably grew at a faster pace than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank\u2019s target.Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, sees another good reason for Poloz and his colleagues to buck the global easing trend. \u201cDo they want to go back to 2015 where they cut rates and stoked a big acceleration in credit and home prices? That\u2019s pretty fresh in their minds,\u201d Kavcic said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they want to go there right now.\u201dA re-acceleration in housing activity in many Canadian cities and some of the strongest wage growth in a decade, even as headline employment slows down, also has the potential to underpin consumption in the second half.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rupert Rowling", "title": "'The genie is out of the bottle': Gold is having its best week in 3 years after breaching $1,500", "description": "Gold has risen 4.3 per cent this week, the largest increase since April 2016", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle-gold-is-having-its-best-week-in-3-years-after-breaching-1500?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gold-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 9, 2019 8:16 AM EDT", "content": "Gold is poised for its best week since 2016 as the metal holds onto gains that propelled it past US$1,500 an ounce and silver trades near a 14-month high.Both metals have rallied amid worries about the global economic outlook and as central banks around the world continue to cut interest rates.

It\u2019s still up 14 per cent for the year, compared with 15 per cent for the S&P 500.The nation\u2019s economy has strengthen since the beginning of the year, the labour market has been on a tear and Canada\u2019s real estate market \u2014 a bellwether of the economy \u2014 has seen signs of stability with strong prices and increasing sales in major cities like Toronto.To top it off, inflation of 2 per cent ties with the U.K. for the highest in the Group of Seven and right at the Bank of Canada\u2019s target.Technicals argue caution.The intermediate moving average convergence divergence momentum indicator is trending on a sell signal, suggesting that the current correction needs more time to play out, according to Tina Normann, technical research analyst at Eight Capital.\u201cTherefore look for limited upside toward the 16,300 zone on any near term rally,\u201d she said in a note.Investors would need to see stabilization in bond yields before committing capital to the market, she said and added that a more attractive entry point will likely present itself in mid-September.Canada\u2019s 30-year bond yield reached a record low of 1.39 per cent on Wednesday and one segment of Canada\u2019s government-bond yield curve reached its most inverted level since 2000 earlier this week as traders added to bets the nation\u2019s central bank will wind up cutting interest rates. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce moved forward its call for a Bank of Canada rate cut to the first quarter of 2020 from the second quarter on Wednesday.So where can investors put their money north of the border?\u201cIn light of stock market weakness, we believe that the positive attributes of regulated utility stocks could be attractive to a number of investors,\u201d said Robert Kwan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said in an Aug. 7 report.The S&P/TSX Utilities Index has climbed 23 per cent this year and investors flocked to safer sectors. \u201cThe allure of regulated utility stocks is driven by no material exposure to trade wars (e.g., no China exposure),\u201d Kwan said. They also get a tailwind from environmental, social and governance considerations with respect to investment fund flows and long-term interest rates that are within striking distance of record lows, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Enda Curran and Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "World economy headed for its first recession in a decade amid deepening trade dread", "description": "Economists are starting to war game for how a recession could happen", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/world-economy-headed-for-its-first-recession-in-a-decade-as-trade-fears-spread?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/canary-wharf.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 7, 2019 11:05 AM EDT", "content": "The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is nudging the world economy toward its first recession in a decade with investors demanding politicians and central bankers act fast to change course.The latest setback hit German industrial production, which in June registered its biggest annual decline in almost a decade, highlighting the severity of a manufacturing slump in Europe\u2019s largest economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand made surprise interest-rate cuts trying to safeguard their economies from global headwinds.In the U.S., recession risk is \u201cmuch higher than it needs to be and much higher than it was two months ago,\u201d Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary and a White House economic adviser during the last downturn, told Bloomberg Television. \u201cYou can often play with fire and not have anything untoward happen, but if you do it too much you eventually get burned.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-c428c77c2ce2145300e0754e1cd84e70-5ebcb4d0739e3');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-c428c77c2ce2145300e0754e1cd84e70-5ebcb4d0739e3');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-c428c77c2ce2145300e0754e1cd84e70-5ebcb4d0739e3'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nSummers, a Harvard professor, still sees a less than 50/50 chance that the U.S. enters a recession in the next 12 months. Investors are much more bearish: A closely watched segment of the yield curve, the difference between 10-year and three-month U.S. Treasury debt, inverted the most since 2007, indicating bets on protracted weakness.U.S. stocks fell in New York, bonds rallied globally, and havens including gold and the yen gained ground. The yield curve for both the U.S. and German economies are flashing warning signs of a downturn.As U.S.-China trade relations sour, policy interest rates are going down. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday stunned investors by dropping its benchmark rate by 50 basis points, double the expected reduction and sending the kiwi tumbling. Thailand also surprised, cutting by 25 points. India\u2019s central bank lowered its rate by an unconventional 35 points.While tight labour markets globally and the recent shift by central banks should provide a cushion, economists are starting to war game for how a recession could happen. Their fears are mainly centred on the damaging effects of tariffs. \nAs U.S. and China lock horns in worsening trade battle, Canadian business investment feels the fallout\n\u2018At the edge of a cliff\u2019: Oil prices could plummet to $40 if U.S.-China trade war drags down global economy\nGold tops $1,500 as investors rush to find shelter amid gathering global storm\nUnder one scenario, U.S. President Donald Trump would carry through with his latest threat to impose 10 per cent tariffs on a further US$300 billion of Chinese goods, drawing a retaliation from President Xi Jinping. While the direct cost of those tariffs is likely to be small, it is the uncertainty created by a further escalation of the trade war that could weigh on investment, hiring and ultimately consumption.Morgan Stanley economists predict that if the U.S. puts 25 per cent tariffs on all Chinese imports for four to six months and the country hits back, a global economic contraction is likely within three quarters. The tensions also extend beyond the U.S and China to include Japan and South Korea as well as Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union.Global FalloutThe worry is without a trade truce soon, markets will extend their recent slide and uncertainty-plagued companies would pull back further on investment, extending the pain of manufacturers to the services sector. Then, an otherwise tight job market would start to crack and consumers would retrench.While central banks would likely cut interest rates and perhaps resume quantitative easing, that may no longer be enough to revive animal spirits this time and governments might not be fast enough to loosen fiscal policy.\u201cWith no end in sight, there are significant downside risks to our forecasts for U.S. and global growth,\u201d Bank of America Corp. economists warned clients this week. \u201cIf the trade war escalates \u2014 this could include a more explicit currency war \u2014 uncertainty would be considerably higher and financial conditions much tighter.\u201dWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cAsset purchases \u2014 if the ECB and others take that path \u2014 will be less effective this time than they were in the past. Conventional policy space is limited. Unconventional policy is of limited effectiveness. Best hope it\u2019s not needed.\u201d \u2014 Tom Orlik, chief economistMuch depends on consumer and corporate confidence.JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s global manufacturing purchasing managers index already shows contraction. With Germany in a funk, the European Central Bank is poised to unleash a renewed round of stimulus as soon as September, potentially including a rate cut further into negative territory, to fight a deepening slowdown.In the U.S., manufacturing growth has slowed for four straight months and Citigroup Inc. equity strategists have cut their earnings forecast for S&P 500 companies.Then there are consumers. Those in China and the U.S. have continued to spend, perhaps encouraged to by tight labour markets. But JPMorgan economists reckon the pace of global hiring in the second half of this year will slow to its softest since 2012-13. One early warning sign: Car sales in China are reeling from a historic slump.Barely finished cleaning up from their last recessions, central banks are swinging back toward rescue mode. Having cut rates a week ago for the first time since 2008, the Federal Reserve is on course to do so again next month and investors are pricing in further action by year-end. That\u2019s despite Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s signal that he\u2019s undertaking more of a mid-cycle adjustment than a pronounced easing cycle.Trump on Wednesday upbraided the Fed again, citing the three rate cuts in Asia-Pacific in the past 24 hours. \u201cThey must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW,\u201d the U.S. president tweeted. \u201cIncompetence is a terrible thing to watch, especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily.\u201d\u2026.proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!).

In Europe, investors are tracking the chances of a no-deal Brexit later this year, while there are tensions in the Middle East between Iran and the U.S.Further support for the rally has come from central-bank buying, with authorities in China, Russia, Poland and Kazakhstan all boosting holdings.

Trump weighed in on Williams\u2019s remarks, saying a day later that he liked his first statement much more than his second. \nHow a U.S. recession could derail the Canadian economy\nTrump urges Fed to do more than a \u2018small rate cut\u2019\nGet ready for the biggest week of 2019 for the world economy\nRate OutlookThe meeting still contains drama. It\u2019s unclear how much opposition even a quarter-point cut will face within the FOMC, or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing.Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U.S. economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond.\u201cFor a lot of them, 25 will feel like a down payment,\u201d said William English, a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time.\u201dWhat Our Economists Say\u201cUncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well-telegraphed rate cut looming at present. Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing.\u201d\u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg economistsBefore Williams spoke on July 18, investors were pricing in a quarter-point cut. Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation. Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a \u201crisk management\u201d approach.In his remarks, Williams reviewed his long-standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero. Investors took it as a signal that a half-point move might be on the table, until the New York Fed issued the clarification.That steer, combined with a solid \u2014 though not spectacular \u2014 report on second-quarter economic growth, reduced the chances of a half-point cut to \u201calmost zero,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago.The data showed the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.1 per cent, slower than the first quarter but above the 1.8 per cent expected by economists.Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all. That group includes two current FOMC voters, Kansas City\u2019s Esther George and Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren, so resistance could spur two dissents. The meeting\u2019s minutes will be released on Aug. 21, providing a fuller picture of any divide, and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime.Several economists expect the committee\u2019s post-meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter-point cut as early as September, without committing the Fed to such a move.\u201cThe intention is likely to do another 25, but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York.Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations. Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news. Since the Fed last met, the U.S. and China have returned to the trade negotiating table, and fresh U.S. employment and spending numbers have come in strong.\u201cThat\u2019s a tricky issue for him,\u201d said English. \u201cSince June, the data\u2019s been pretty good.\u201dHe may also get questions on whether the Fed would join the U.S. government in intervening to weaken the dollar to aid U.S. exports after Trump told reporters last week that he had not ruled it out.Balance SheetFinancial markets will also watch for an early end to the runoff of securities from the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. That process, scheduled to conclude at the end of September, modestly tightens policy by removing downward pressure on long-term bond yields.Economists were divided on whether officials will want to halt the runoffs when they cut interest rates. Few saw an immediate cessation as likely, but some said it would simplify communications about the direction of monetary policy.\u201cThe markets won\u2019t be affected either way, but it\u2019s a cleaner message\u201d if the Fed halts the runoffs, Coronado said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Simon Kennedy", "title": "Get ready for the biggest week of 2019 for the world economy", "description": "The Fed isn't the only event this week with the ability to shape the outlook for the global economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/get-ready-for-the-world-economys-biggest-week-of-2019", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/globe1.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 29, 2019 8:58 AM EDT", "content": "There will be no chance of a summer break for investors or policy makers in coming days as they brace for what might be the busiest week for the world economy this year.The highlight is Wednesday\u2019s decision by the Federal Reserve with markets and economists virtually united in predicting Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues will cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.Some Fed watchers predict officials will cut their benchmark by half a percentage point, but the signal is that they will eschew a bigger move in favor of a quarter point reduction.

Then on Thursday, the ISM manufacturing report is expected to show industry is stabilizing and continuing to expand. Friday\u2019s trade data will be pored over for evidence that the skirmish with China is having an effect. Also next week, the Treasury will say on Wednesday how much money it needs to borrow amid rising budget deficits.Europe, Middle East and AfricaIt\u2019s a big week for data after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week paved the way to cut interest rates in September and perhaps relaunch bond-buying. Tuesday is set to witness another decline in euro-area confidence while the following day is likely to confirm that the economy slowed in the second quarter to half the pace of the 0.4 per cent of the prior three months.

Banks across the Persian Gulf region will probably move to ease if the Fed cuts as expected.AsiaBank of Japan policy makers finish a meeting on July 30. About a a third of economists in a survey published last week said they expect policy makers to strengthen their pledge to maintain rock-bottom interest rates rather than do nothing and risk a sharp appreciation of the yen should the Fed cut rates. Still, some officials see little to be gained from such a tweak, according to people familiar with the matter.

He argues lower interest rates, an accelerating housing market, a solid labour market, record high stocks and overall decent investment returns will support consumption.\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see a pick up in big ticket items again,\u201d Demers said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not great because we\u2019re relying on debt, but in terms of dynamics, it looks more positive over the next 12 to 18 months in an environment where rates are going down, and not up.\u201d \nDelinquency rates climb to two-year high as Canadian credit card balances grow\nCanadians\u2019 insolvency problems might not be as bad as everyone thinks, C.D. Howe says\nWith the Bank of Canada holding interest rates \u2026 just how vulnerable are Canadians to debt?\nHome sales skidded to their lowest since 2012 last year as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market. Automobile sales also suffered in Canada, with 2018 marking the first annual drop since the last recession. The malaise has been reflected in the pace of household credit growth, which has slowed to a crawl: It rose just 3.4 per cent in May, the weakest annual pace since 1983.But the Canadian housing market \u2014 east of Manitoba, at least \u2014 is already showing signs of shaking off that weakness. Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show prices through June in the Greater Toronto Area are 3 per cent higher on a six-month average basis, while Ottawa and Montreal have seen even faster gains, up 7.6 per cent and and 6.4 per cent respectively. In addition, the 11.5 per cent increase in resale volumes in the GTA signals \u201cvery strong,\u201d demand, Demers said.\u201cThe soft landing is behind us,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you think about the GTA and Canada in general, we\u2019re looking more at a re-acceleration.\u201dThe high household debt level \u201cremains a big concern and a headwind to the Canadian dollar,\u201d said Demers, and without a strong capital spending boom, the lingering debt burden will mean it\u2019s tough to \u201coutperform trend growth\u201d once rates eventually move higher, constraining disposable income.In the shorter term, however, Demers is more bullish on Canada, partly because the country\u2019s equity market may be less exposed to trade-war uncertainty. He sees car sales stabilizing this summer, and the housing market in central Canada continuing to accelerate. Gross domestic product for May on Wednesday will give an indication of whether the country\u2019s economic upswing remains on track.\u201cThe pace of credit growth should pick up in the second half of this year,\u201d as more \u201ctrend-like\u201d household spending returns, Demers said. \u201cThis removes a lot of the downside risks regarding households we saw earlier this year.\u201dConsumer confidence highest in a year and a half \n \nOne more reason to believe big-ticket spending is set for a rebound is the recent surge in consumer confidence measures, which are closely tied to the state of the economy and moves in stock markets. The Bloomberg Nanos economic mood index reached 59.06 this month, the highest level in a year and a half. Periods of elevated consumer confidence tend to coincide with increases in home and vehicle sales.The fear of missing out is also fuelling the nation\u2019s debt habit.40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they're spending more than they earn \n \nA survey by Manulife Bank of Canada found almost 40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they\u2019re spending more than they earn, and 12 per cent attribute the imbalance to an excess of costly outings with friends or family.A lot of that has to do with the pressure of social media, according to Rick Lunny, the bank\u2019s chief executive officer, who says especially for younger people who haven\u2019t had time to build savings, the rising cost of housing and child care leaves little to spend on entertainment.\u201cEverybody\u2019s on social media,\u201d Lunny said by phone. \u201cEverybody seems to have a better life than you.

The statistics agency also noted its \u201ctrading-day adjustment,\u201d where it accounts for the number of heavier shopping days in a calendar month, may have skewed the May results to the downside.

The last time they expressed worries was at a decision in October 2017, though the gains then had been much sharper.Alternatively, Bank of Canada officials may simply brush off the appreciation \u2014 if they acknowledge it at all \u2014 as a reflection of solid growth. Recent data show the economy was much stronger in the second quarter than anyone expected, while U.S. growth is slowing. Price pressures are also stronger in Canada, with underlying inflation at about the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target for more than a year.Most economists believe the Bank of Canada could probably buck any minor easing trend by the Federal Reserve, and remain on hold indefinitely. Pollick is one exception, with the CIBC strategist predicting a cut next year due to the \u201ccurrency channels.\u201dInvestors too are still placing large odds on one cut over the next 12 months, market data suggest. But that\u2019s a far cry from the almost full percentage point cut being priced in for the Fed.\u201cWe\u2019re in what I\u2019m going to call a resilient pocket where Canada can look a lot better than the rest of the world, at least in the foreseeable future,\u201d Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management Ltd., told BNN Bloomberg last week.The Bank of Canada has been quiet on the subject in recent weeks, but the last time Poloz spoke in May he reiterated his belief there\u2019s underlying strength in the economy and that interest rates are poised to continue rising once headwinds dissipate. The Bank of Canada has already raised borrowing costs five times since mid 2017.For someone labeled a currency dove almost from the instant he became Bank of Canada governor, there is an irony to his current predicament.Poloz has always hated the label, or any other insinuation he is predisposed to any policy bias. In fact, he\u2019s sought to do the opposite \u2014 wean investors off guidance and place the emphasis on data and the economic outlook.If he was more dovish early on in his mandate, it\u2019s because the data dictated a change in policy. When the data dictated the need for hikes in 2017, he hiked. And in times of heightened uncertainty, the smart move has been to remain cautious.So, even if the dollar is mentioned, the focus on Wednesday will still likely be on how policy makers are interpreting the recent numbers, and how they assess global risks potentially impacting Canada.The offsetting forces between elevated global uncertainty and the stronger Canadian economy may leave the Bank of Canada wanting to keep its current \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach intact Wednesday in order to leave all its options open.Another possibility is they choose to raise red flags about the weakening global outlook undermining business investment and exports, going as far as to cut their medium-term growth forecasts and watering down any talk about future hikes. That could knock the dollar down a peg or two.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s jobs market stalls after monster gains in first half of year", "description": "Decline comes after two months of gains", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/update-1-canada-economy-sheds-2200-jobs-in-june-after-two-months-of-gains", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/service-canada.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 5, 2019 11:08 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s booming labour market geared down in June, with employment little changed and a slight uptick in the jobless rate from historical lows.The economy shed 2,200 jobs on the month, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus economist expectations for a gain of about 10,000.

Half of that came from manufacturers. Employment in goods-producing industries is down by 9,400 in the first six months of 2019.Wages, however, are showing signs of strength. Annual hourly wages gains accelerated to 3.8 per cent in June, the fastest since May last year and up from 2.8 per cent in May. Pay gains for permanent workers climbed 3.6 per cent, also a sharp increase. The year-over- year acceleration largely reflects weakness this time last year.Total hours worked accelerated to 1.8 per cent from 1 per cent in May, the most since last fall.Bloomberg.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-1dfb19629eaf23ac986a7fa9cebc1a3d-5ebcb5d1f286a');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-1dfb19629eaf23ac986a7fa9cebc1a3d-5ebcb5d1f286a');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-1dfb19629eaf23ac986a7fa9cebc1a3d-5ebcb5d1f286a'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto home sales surge 10%, narrowing affordable options for buyers", "description": "New listings down in tight market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-rise-in-june-as-supply-remains-constrained?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/house-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 4, 2019 1:34 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales jumped again in June, nudging prices higher and narrowing affordable options for buyers.A total of 8,860 homes changed hands in Canada\u2019s biggest city in the month, up 10 per cent from the same month a year earlier, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Thursday. New listings fell 0.4 per cent to 15,816, leading to increased competition between buyers and price increases across certain segments.Benchmark prices, which adjusts for the type of housing sold, rose 3.6 per cent to $798,500 from a year ago, driven by gains in semi-detached homes, townhouses and condos.The average price of a home increased 3 per cent from last June to $832,703. While sales of detached homes surged 19 per cent from last year, they were the only segment to see prices drop on an average basis, falling 1.4 per cent.Toronto home sales have bounced back in recent months after slumping amid tighter mortgage-lending rules and higher interest rates in the past year.

The decline was largely driven by sales in the core of the city, which saw sales fall 5.6 per cent compared to a gain of 2.7 per cent in the greater Toronto region. Still, condo prices continued to rise overall, with the benchmark price up 7.5 per cent in June to $539,500 from the same month a year ago.Slight ReliefThe number of condos leased jumped 15 per cent in the second quarter to 9,749 from the same period last year, as listings grew by 29 per cent.Rents continued to rise but at a slower pace.

AsCentral guardian of the world\u2019s second-biggest currency area from Nov. 1, giving press conferences after each ECB policy meeting, her opinions will be key even if she leans on colleagues such as Philip Lane to craft detailed plans.For the European Union leaders who nominated her, a smooth transition from Mario Draghi is key \u2014 Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that \u201cwe have someone who gives guarantees that they won\u2019t constitute a rupture\u201d with the current president\u2019s strategy. \nChristine Lagarde to succeed Mario Draghi as ECB chief just as economy weakens\nA Lagarde-run ECB might mean a very different kind of presidency\n\u2018Utterly frustrating\u2019: IMF\u2019s Lagarde dismayed over protectionism tearing down free trade she helped build: Kevin Carmichael\nHere is a selection of what Lagarde has said about the central bank\u2019s actions and challenges:Outright Monetary TransactionsDraghi\u2019s flagship tool for fighting the euro-zone debt crisis has never been used but it\u2019s still critical that the incoming chief backs it. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann\u2019s opposition to the bond-buying program known as OMT may have scuttled his own shot at the top job. Lagarde was in the audience when Draghi pledged in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro, and spoke in favor of OMT after the program was announced weeks later.\u201cMany of the right decisions have been taken. Most recently, initiatives by major central banks \u2014 the European Central Bank\u2019s OMT bond-purchasing program, QE3 by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan\u2019s expanded Asset Purchase Program \u2014 are big policy signals in the right direction.\u201d \u2014 Sept. 24, 2012, Washington DCNegative Interest RatesShortly after the BOJ followed the ECB in adopting a negative interest rate in 2016, Lagarde praised the tool while saying more time is needed to assess its side effects. That\u2019s an issue on the Governing Council\u2019s agenda now as officials consider whether to cut rates further and keep them below zero for longer.While banks complain that negative rates \u2014 effectively a charge on their overnight reserves \u2014 hurt profitability, the ECB says that\u2019s outweighed by the boost to the economy. Lagarde thought so as well.\u201cIf we had not had those negative rates, we would be in a much worse place today, with inflation probably lower than where it is, with growth probably lower than where we have it.\u201d \u2014 March 18, 2016, Ho Chi Minh CityQuantitative EasingDraghi had to fight hard against skeptics both outside and within the ECB\u2019s Governing Council to launch his broad-based asset-purchase program. He finally announced it in January 2015, as the euro zone was teetering on the edge of deflation. Lagarde responded the same day.\u201cWe welcome the measures announced today that will strongly reinforce the ECB\u2019s accommodative stance. The planned expansion of the ECB\u2019s balance sheet will help lower borrowing cost across the euro area, raise inflation expectations and reduce the risk of a protracted period of low inflation.\u201d \u2014 Jan. 22, 2015, IMF statementFiscal SupportLagarde has demonstrated realism when it comes to central banks\u2019 ability to counter the next downturn, backing the ECB\u2019s repeated calls for governments to offer more support with better fiscal policies. She has urged nations to strike a better balance between growth, debt sustainability and social objectives.\u201cMonetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, and should anchor expectations\u2026. The reality is that many economies are not resilient enough. High public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will. For many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d \u2014 April 2, 2019, WashingtonEuropean ReformsDraghi and his colleagues have also spent years urging governments to pursue structural reforms to bolster their economies, cries that have intensified as populist movements challenge European cohesion. Lagarde is on board with that as well, advocating flexible hiring practices, modernizing and harmonizing insolvency regimes, and spending more on innovation.\u201cOur goal should be clear: Restarting convergence and ensuring the fruits of economic growth are shared broadly across the EU. This will help restore faith in the European project.\u201d \u2014 Feb. 14, 2019, MunichFresh StimulusThe ECB and the Federal Reserve are expected to ease their monetary stances as soon as this summer in response to a global economic slowdown amid risks including U.S.-driven trade protectionism and Brexit. For that strategy, Lagarde has delivered praise, while again reminding governments that central bankers can\u2019t do it alone.\u201cThese policy responses have provided vital support over the past few months.\u2026 When the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will, policy makers may need to use all policy tools to maximize their combined effect. This means supporting demand through decisive monetary easing and fiscal stimulus wherever possible.\u201d \u2014 June 5, 2019, IMF blogRadical TheoryFinally, Lagarde has dipped into a topic that tends to make central bankers shudder \u2014 Modern Monetary Theory. Typically advocated as an argument for governments to worry less about budget deficits and use fiscal firepower to achieve full employment, monetary officials see it as poison to their independence. While Lagarde said MMT is no panacea, she didn\u2019t reject it outright.\u201cWhile it is tempting, when you look at the sort of mathematical modelling of it, and it seems to stand, there are big caveats about it, such as if the country is in a liquidity trap, such as if there is deflation. Well then, in those circumstances, it could possibly work for a short period of time probably, because interest rates stay low until such time when they start going up. And then it is a bit of a trap.\u201d \u2014 April 11, 2019, IMF press conferenceBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Simon Kennedy", "title": "Christine Lagarde to succeed Mario Draghi as ECB chief just as economy weakens", "description": "Lagarde becomes the first woman to run euro-area monetary policy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/christine-lagarde-to-succeed-mario-draghi-as-ecb-chief-amid-weakening-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/christine-lagarde.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 2, 2019 2:28 PM EDT", "content": "Christine Lagarde is set to swap the helm of the International Monetary Fund for that of the European Central Bank, becoming the first woman to run euro-area monetary policy just as the bloc\u2019s economy looks in need of fresh stimulus.Lagarde was nominated to succeed Mario Draghi as president of the ECB when his eight-year term ends on Oct. 31. European governments turned to the 63-year old onetime lawyer and former French finance minister on Tuesday after hours of negotiations over a package of top EU jobs.In moving from Washington to Frankfurt, Lagarde will be tasked with driving monetary policy in a 19-nation economy which Draghi has already signalled will need more help, likely in the form of lower interest rates and possibly with the resumption of quantitative easing. Inflation is running at barely half the ECB\u2019s goal of just under 2 per cent despite years of negative rates and 2.6 trillion euros (US$3 trillion) of bond purchases. \nA Lagarde-run ECB might mean a very different kind of presidency\nIMF cuts global outlook to lowest since the financial crisis\n\u2018Utterly frustrating\u2019: IMF\u2019s Lagarde dismayed over protectionism tearing down free trade she helped build\nInvestors will likely bet that as a seasoned crisis-fighter, Lagarde will share Draghi\u2019s taste for aggressive and innovative monetary policy, especially as her appointment means the more hawkish Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann misses out. Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Financial markets are already pricing an ECB rate cut by September, in line with predictions by ECB watchers at Bloomberg Economics and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Morgan Stanley said the choice of Lagarde increases their \u201cconviction\u201d that the ECB will eventually resume buying bonds.Lagarde last week described the world economy as hitting a \u201crough patch\u201d and advised central banks to continue to adjust their policies in response. In June 2014, she said she would \u201ccertainly hope\u201d the ECB would conduct QE if inflation stayed sluggish \u2014 months before it announced it would do so.Moliere\u2019s TreesShe also praised Draghi\u2019s 2012 commitment to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro and recently echoed his call for governments to do more to battle future downturns. In March, she linked the need to fortify the euro area to the words of playwright Moliere: \u201cThe trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.\u201dJust last September, Lagarde dismissed speculation she could take over the ECB, telling the Financial Times she was a \u201d bit annoyed and fed up\u201d with the suggestion and that she was \u201cnot interested\u201d in the role. Only one economist surveyed last month predicted she would get the job, with Weidmann seen as the most likely winner in a tight race dominated by men.France has now twice secured the presidency of the two-decade-old ECB. Draghi, an Italian, was preceded by Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, who replaced Dutchman Wim Duisenberg.In common with Trichet, whose appointment was held up by a trial involving the bailout of Credit Lyonnais, Lagarde brings a history of legal wrangles. They culminated in a conviction of negligence in 2016 over her handling of a multi-million euro dispute linked to the same bank.Lagarde\u2019s appointment also means the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve will be headed by former lawyers, a shift from the era when central banks were run by academic economists such as Ben Bernanke. That risks opening her up to criticism that she lacks the knowledge to set monetary policy.\u201cShe\u2019s very political, she\u2019s very wise, and I would assume she has the best economists that can help her with this,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment. \u201cIt is a little puzzling because she\u2019s not known as one of the leading economic minds out there.\u201dShe does boast political nous though, which will be needed to unite fellow ECB officials when setting policy \u2014 especially if they run low on monetary ammunition and need to nudge governments to step up support of the economy.\u201cShe has the political skills needed to build consensus on the Governing Council, is a good communicator and has the standing and backbone to defend the ECB\u2019s decisions on the larger European stage \u2014 though she may still face skepticism in Germany,\u201d said Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \u201cShe would be forceful in calling on member states to make use of the fiscal space.\u201dEU Council President Donald Tusk dismissed concerns about Lagarde\u2019s lack of formal economic training. She will make a \u201cperfect\u201d ECB president, he said in Brussels.Alongside Sabine Lautenschlaeger, Lagarde will be one of two women on the six-member Executive Board. They are likely to be the only two female participants in the 25-member Governing Council, which includes the governors of euro-region national central banks and has long been dominated by men.Broader ViewLagarde was also the first woman to serve as managing director of the IMF, being first appointed in 2011 and then handed another five year term in 2016. She will now leave more than 1 1/2 years before that is due to end, likely sparking a fight between capitals over whether a European should always run the lender or if it\u2019s time for an emerging-market candidate to do so.At the IMF, Lagarde helped negotiate the fund\u2019s biggest ever bailout when it handed fresh aid last year to Argentina. She also sought to give emerging economies such as China more of a voice in its management, while putting greater emphasis on issues including climate change and income and gender inequality. That helped broaden the fund\u2019s image beyond its reputation as an advocate of budget cuts.She sometimes clashed with countries whose monetary policy she will now help set. As the leader of one of Greece\u2019s major creditors, she found herself both pressuring the country to accept austerity to keep it in the euro-zone while at the same time persuading its European partners to allow debt relief. In 2018, she and Weidmann disagreed publicly after she called upon Germany\u2019s government to spend more and close its current account surplus.Lagarde was educated in France and the U.S., working as an intern in the U.S. Congress for a time. On graduating from the University of Paris, Nanterre, she joined the Paris office of Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP. She focused on employment law and mergers and acquisitions, rising through its ranks to become a partner in 1987 and then its chairman in 1999.Then-French President Jacques Chirac launched her political career in 2005 by appointing her minister for trade. She went on to serve as minister for agriculture before becoming the first woman to become finance minister in a Group of Seven economy in June 2007.She held that role as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. set off a global recession and paved the way for the euro-area debt crisis. During the all-night talks of policy makers that followed she often sought to boost morale by passing M&M\u2019s chocolates around fellow finance chiefs.\u201cIf it had been Lehman Sisters rather than Lehman Brothers, the world might well look a lot different today,\u201d she once said.A past member of France\u2019s synchronized swimming team, Lagarde said her experience in the pool had taught her how to \u201cgrit your teeth and smile.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Utilities, energy bonds rule in Canada in longer-duration world", "description": "They've been given a boost this year by rising expectations that the Bank of Canada will eventually have to cut interest rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/utilities-energy-bonds-rule-in-canada-in-longer-duration-world", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/altagas.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 2, 2019 11:36 AM EDT", "content": "Canada investors holding utilities and energy bonds are finally being rewarded, though it has little to do with the power businesses.AltaGas Ltd. and other energy companies are among the largest issuers of longer-term bonds in Canada and they\u2019ve been given a boost this year by rising expectations that the Bank of Canada will eventually have to cut interest rates.\u201cThe most duration sensitive bonds are outperforming and utilities and energy companies issue longer-dated bonds,\u201d said Nicholas Leach, portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management, which has $134 billion (US$102 billion) under management.

Conference Board data showed sentiment fell in June to the lowest since 2017 on Tuesday. At the same time, survey respondents turned bearish on U.S. stocks at one of the fastest paces since the global financial crisis. The deterioration marks a swift turn from similar data in May that marked the best sentiment in 15 years.To Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield Asset Management LLC, there\u2019s reason to believe consumer confidence peaked back in October 2018. That \u201crepresents a warning for the overall investment cycle given that confidence measures historically peak fairly close to the overall bull market,\u201d he wrote in an email.Slowing earnings growthIt\u2019s one of Wall Street\u2019s big dramas. Did earnings growth peak as effects from President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul sunk in? Companies in the S&P 500 posted three straight quarters of 25 per cent profit growth last year. This year, analysts expect earnings for the benchmark to come in at US$166.20 a share. Sure, that\u2019s still a gain of four per cent from last year, but down from the near-eight-per-cent increase that was expected in January.It remains true that peak earnings growth doesn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of the stock market cycle. Richard Bernstein Advisors research has shown that since 1980, earnings growth has peaked 11 times, and in the years following 10 of those periods, S&P 500 returns were positive.Still, the direction of earnings is closely intertwined with stock market returns. In 2000, S&P 500 profit growth topped out in the same quarter that marked highs for the index. When the benchmark rolled over in 2007, earnings gains had been waning for three quarters. Profits may not be doomed to fall this year, but they\u2019re likely not going to get much better, either.Jobless claims bottom?It\u2019s looking possible jobless claims hit a trough for the current economic cycle. In April, weekly claims dropped to 192,000, the lowest number since 1969, and the count has been higher ever since. Estimates for Thursday\u2019s release call for 220,000, above the last reading.If the pattern continues, investors should take note. Jobless claims and the S&P 500 have moved inversely since the turn of the century, with bottoms in the data coinciding with peaks for stocks. Andrew Zatlin of SouthBay Research Inc., the top Bloomberg-ranked jobless claims forecaster, sees \u201cpre-recessionary signals\u201d in the data.\u201cWhen Initial Claims are the same as the prior year, it\u2019s a sign that businesses have stopped growing,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIn the year to date (24 weeks), most weeks have been at or above the prior year\u2019s nominal levels.\u201dMovement of goodsStrategists at Morgan Stanley often cite a more unconventional index as a sign off worry \u2014 the Cass Freight Index, which in essence measures the flow of goods through shipments. The gauge recently fell 6.5 per cent year-over-year and now stands at a \u201ccritical level,\u201d according to the firm. If it slips any further, the index may be signalling a recession, strategists led by Mike Wilson warned.In the most recent report, Cass Freight said \u201cWe see the shipments index as going from \u2018warning of a potential slowdown\u2019 to \u2018signaling an economic contraction.\u201d\u2018Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Boesler and Rich Miller", "title": "Fed's Powell reiterates case for interest rate cuts amid increased economic risks", "description": "The Fed chairman also highlighted the importance of the central bank's autonomy from political interference, but didn't mention Trump by name", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/feds-powell-reiterates-case-for-interest-rate-cuts-amid-increased-economic-risks", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jerome-powell-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 25, 2019 2:22 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have increased recently, reinforcing the case among policy makers for somewhat lower interest rates.\u201cCrosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy,\u201d Powell said Tuesday in the text of remarks to be delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.His comments echoed those he made last week following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

While the Fed left its key rate unchanged, it dropped a reference to being \u201cpatient\u201d on borrowing costs.

His vote marked the first dissent of Powell\u2019s 16-month tenure as chairman.Policy makers were starkly divided on the path for policy. Eight of 17 penciled in a reduction by the end of the year as another eight saw no change and one forecast a hike, according to updated quarterly forecasts.In the statement, officials downgraded their assessment of economic activity to a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace from \u201csolid\u201d at their last gathering.The pivot toward easier monetary policy shows the Fed swinging closer to the view of most investors that Trump\u2019s trade war is slowing the economy\u2019s momentum and that rates are too restrictive given sluggish inflation.Trump\u2019s attacks on the Fed risk casting a political shadow over whatever policy decision the Fed makes, though Powell and his colleagues say they\u2019re focusing only on the economic goals Congress gave them.Officials noted that \u201cgrowth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year\u201d and that indicators of business fixed investment \u201chave been soft.\u201d They repeated that the labour market \u201cremains strong.\u201dInvestors have been betting the Fed will reduce rates at its next meeting in late July, though a majority of economists surveyed earlier this month don\u2019t expect a move until December.Recent U.S. economic data have been mixed. Consumer spending held up in May but job gains were disappointing, and some gauges of business sentiment have cooled on uncertainty around the outlook for trade. The Fed remains bedevilled by inflation continuing to undershoot the central bank\u2019s 2 per cent target despite unemployment being at a 49-year low.What Our Economists Say\u201cBloomberg Economics retains the view that if economic data firm somewhat and trade tensions cool, the Fed may avoid embarking on insurance cuts \u2014 or at the very least will deliver far less accommodation than what markets have started to price in.\u201d \u2013Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Eliza WingerCentral bankers are likely hoping for greater clarity over Trump\u2019s trade war with China.

A replacement would have to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.Trump\u2019s team conducted the legal analysis and came to a conclusion that has remained closely held within the White House, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It isn\u2019t clear whether Trump directed the legal review, and the people didn\u2019t describe the outcome.A White House official who declined to be identified said he wouldn\u2019t comment on what he called alleged discussions from months ago. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said demoting Powell isn\u2019t currently under consideration.\u201cIt\u2019s not happening today so therefore I have nothing to say on it,\u201d Kudlow told reporters at the White House.Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in an email: \u201cUnder the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause.\u201d \nJerome Powell says he wouldn\u2019t resign at Trump\u2019s request while Yellen worries attacks will undermine Fed\nTrump complained to wealthy donors in the Hamptons about Jerome Powell\u2019s rate hikes\nJanet Yellen is leaving the Fed when Jerome Powell is sworn in, giving Trump more sway over world\u2019s most powerful bank\nBloomberg News reported in December that Trump discussed firing Powell out of frustration over the central bank\u2019s interest rate increases.While Trump still regularly expresses his displeasure with the Fed in tweets, talk of removing Powell has subsided. Trump told Powell in a March phone call, \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with you,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal.The Federal Reserve Act provides explicit protection for all Fed governors against removal by the president except \u201cfor cause.\u201d Courts have interpreted the phrase to require proof of some form of legal misconduct or neglect of basic duties. A disagreement over monetary policy wouldn\u2019t meet that bar.However, it\u2019s less clear whether the president can demote a chair, removing him or her from the top position while leaving the person as a Fed governor.Scott Alvarez, who served as the Fed\u2019s general counsel for more than a decade until 2017, said Powell may be protected thanks to changes Congress made to the law four decades ago.Up to that point, the president simply named the Fed chairman from among governors already confirmed by the Senate. But in 1977, lawmakers amended the act, requiring the Senate to confirm chair and vice-chair nominees for four-year terms separately from the confirmation of their governorships, which run as long as 14 years.Alvarez said the courts would likely interpret the 1977 change as removing not only the president\u2019s unilateral authority to name the chair, but also the ability to dismiss him or her without cause. There is, however, no precedent for such a move and no way to know how the courts would rule if the Fed, or Powell himself, challenged the demotion.I guess I'm stuck with you.U.S. President Donald Trump \n \nThe White House legal team developed its analysis after Trump in December privately discussed firing Powell following an interest rate increase that roiled global financial markets. The Fed has raised rates seven times since Trump took office.Fed policymakers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. No rate move is expected immediately, though economists and investors generally agree the central bank will cut borrowing costs this year.Powell, who became chairman in February 2018, has drawn Trump\u2019s ire for not being more accommodating of his trade war with China. The president has repeatedly complained that the Fed, under Powell, has stymied growth and financial markets by raising rates.\u201cHe\u2019s my pick \u2014 and I disagree with him entirely,\u201d Trump said last week in an interview with ABC News. \u201cFrankly, if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn\u2019t have raised interest rates so much we would have been at least a point and a half higher.\u201dTrump had a casual dinner with Powell and Fed Vice-Chairman Richard Clarida in February, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time. The Fed released a statement shortly after the meeting saying that the group discussed the U.S. economy\u2019s performance and outlook, but that Powell didn\u2019t share his expectations for monetary policy.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump as he announces Jerome Powell\u2019s nomination to the Federal Reserve.\n\nCarlos Barria / Reuters\n\nPowell told the CBS News program 60 Minutes in March that he didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to comment on Trump. But Powell also said he doesn\u2019t think the president has the authority to fire him. \u201cThe law is clear that I have a four-year term. And I fully intend to serve it,\u201d he said.Even if he could demote Powell, Trump can\u2019t choose the chair of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee. By tradition, committee members select the Fed chair as their chairman, but they are free to choose anyone on the panel. In the absence of a chair, the committee\u2019s vice-chair \u2014 traditionally the president of the New York Fed \u2014 would run the meetings.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration\u2019s analysis of demoting Powell points to \u201cchaos\u201d in the White House.\u201cWhat we have learned through the decades is that when monetary policy is tampered with politically, the average middle-class person is hurt,\u201d Schumer told reporters Tuesday. \u201cPresident Trump has no understanding of history, he has no understanding that there are people who know these issues better than him.\u201dCurrently, five of the Fed\u2019s seven seats are filled, and Trump is weighing candidates for the other two seats. Trump has named four people since last year for those two seats, none of whom made it through Senate confirmation.By voicing his frustrations with the Fed, Trump breaks with at least two decades of tradition of presidents refraining from publicly commenting on monetary policy. Presidents, however, have reportedly applied pressure on rates.Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker recounted in a recent memoir that in 1984, President Ronald Reagan ordered him not to raise rates before elections. Former President George H.W. Bush urged Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates in a June 1992 interview with the New York Times.Trump on Tuesday took his pressure campaign against central bankers to the European Central Bank. The president accused the euro area and China of weakening their currencies to gain an economic advantage, calling out ECB President Mario Draghi for pledging monetary stimulus just before the Fed meeting this week.Draghi said at the institution\u2019s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, that \u201cadditional stimulus will be required\u201d if the economic outlook for the 19-nation euro area doesn\u2019t improve.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Drop in auto production leads surprise decline in Canada\u2019s factory output", "description": "Motor vehicle production fell 8.9%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/drop-in-autos-leads-surprise-decline-in-canadian-manufacturing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/auto-plant.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 18, 2019 1:24 PM EDT", "content": "Factory production unexpectedly fell in Canada on a temporary slowdown in the auto sector.Manufacturing sales fell 0.6% in April, Statistics Canada said Thursday from Ottawa.

But he already knows how he\u2019d respond to potential levies.\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive to fly a bar of gold,\u201d Boyd said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto bureau. \u201cWe would just refine it somewhere else.

Global trade jitters have strengthened the U.S. dollar at the expense of the Mexican and Canadian currencies, significantly reducing Agnico\u2019s costs, he said.In the hour-long interview, Boyd discussed a wide range of issues, from consolidation in the gold industry to the succession plan for a company he has helmed for more than 20 years.Growth OpportunitiesDespite two mega-mergers in the gold space in the past year, Boyd has no interest in large M&A and believes most consolidation will happen between companies with market values of $1 billion to $3 billion. He\u2019s not worried about any of the world\u2019s giants making a run at Agnico and says he doesn\u2019t waste time looking over his shoulder. Instead, he plans to focus on running his existing portfolio while looking for small acquisitions in safe jurisdictions.Gold\u2019s GainsGold equities, which have underperformed spot gold prices in the past year, are on the verge of a breakout, Boyd says. That\u2019s one point he\u2019s been making while actively wooing high-wealth European generalist investors recently, meeting one day over lunch in Vienna and dinner in Monaco. The current rally in gold prices isn\u2019t about tariffs, he says, but rather the buildup of a number of factors, including a \u201ctired\u201d stock market, \u201cwobbly\u201d economic growth, and rising sovereign debt levels around the world.Resistance has been strong at US$1,360-$US1,370 an ounce of gold; Boyd believes it will take a cut in U.S. interest rates to propel the market above that level. \u201cGold came out of the chute in early 2016 and investors showed up again and the equities took off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could be at that point now.\u201dMoney to SpendWith cash flow set to ramp up, Agnico will be able to continue its 36-year streak of dividends, but the company will also take a look at its balance sheet, Boyd said. \u201cWe have debt maturing so we\u2019ll pay that as we come due.\u201dThe next major tranche \u2014 about $360 million \u2014 at roughly 6.6 per cent interest is due in April 2020, he said. \u201cIt would be nice to reduce that because we could go to the market today and get 4.5 per cent, for 10- to 15-year money.\u201d\n\nDrilling at the Pinos Altos mine in Chihuahua, northern Mexico.\n\nCourtesy Agnico-Eagle\n\nSuccession PlanIn a high-risk sector characterized by ups and downs, Boyd stands out for his longevity.

Only about $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) of Canadian uninsured mortgages have been pooled in RMBS deals, or about 0.1 per cent of the country\u2019s mortgage debt, according to rating company DBRS Ltd. No lender has widely marketed such a deal since September, when private lender MCAP sold $254 million of the notes.While previous efforts to kick-start an RMBS market have borne little fruit, this time may be different as Canadian home prices are rising at the slowest pace this decade amid higher interest rates, regulatory changes and tax increases designed to reign in surging prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. \nBank of Montreal joins Poloz\u2019s push to bolster market for residential mortgage-backed securities\nThe Bank of Canada is pushing a private mortgage-backed securities market \u2014 but is anybody buying?\nStephen Poloz\u2019s \u2018call to arms\u2019 for mortgage market shakeup is something worth fighting for\n\u201cWhile lenders are very well equipped to manage normal market risks, I suspect they are rather unwilling to take on the additional risk of future government intervention in the housing markets,\u201d said Andrey Pavlov, a professor of finance at Beedie School of Business of Simon Fraser University in Greater Vancouver. \u201cTherefore, lenders are likely more interested today than they have ever been in hedging their residential real estate exposure, and mortgage backed securities would be a good way to do so.\u201dLenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and returns \u2014 too much risk it turned out during the U.S. financial crisis when shady loans made it into MBS tranches. There\u2019s been little evidence risky mortgages have become a feature in Canada. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property.On top of raising funds, the sellers of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital they have to set aside to cover eventual losses should they meet certain conditions, including selling significant portions of the lower rated, higher risk bond tranches.Longer TermThe notes are repaid as borrowers pay down debt. The legal duration of the bonds could be significantly longer than the expected repayment rate suggests. This could be a useful tool for lenders to offer longer-term mortgages in a country where most of the home loans have a 5-year term. The repayment of the bonds can be adapted to the repayment of the underlying collateral.Up until 2016, Canadian lenders relied heavily on Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., the country\u2019s national housing agency to insure mortgages with down payments of less than 20 per cent and then packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities to fund obligations. But as part of its efforts to curb taxpayer exposure to the housing market, the government made it more difficult to get insurance. The market for uninsured mortgages took off \u2014 MBS based on the debt less so.\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing education job around investors just to highlight the difference between that product and the CMHC product, and we are investing in that so that the market grows over time,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an interview last week. The RMBS \u201cmarket is not nearly as developed as the CMHC mortgage bond market is. I would say our hope is over time that market will grow, and the banks generally I believe are interested in issuing that product.\u201dThe Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of participants in the bond market, has been working since at least last year to analyze the conditions and incentives that would be required to expand interest in the asset class, according to the minutes of their meetings. It conducted a focus group last month with mostly buy side institutions about the disclosure on the underlying collateral and other features they may require. The group, known as CFIF, was scheduled to discuss the issue again at a June 4 meeting.Data PortalOne way to bolster investors\u2019 confidence in deals would be by setting up a public database of mortgages used in securitization deals including anonymized details of the borrower, property and loan performance, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said last month.

While the research surrounding Canada\u2019s reviews has been serious, the end result each time has only been minor changes. \nBoC upbeat about outlook as it leaves rates unchanged, but will proceed with caution\nBank of Canada done raising rates until end of 2020, with 40% chance of cut, poll says\nWilliam Watson: Without going full Trump, maybe we could (slightly) politicize interest rates\nThe biggest tweak, made in 2011, gave the Bank of Canada more time to reach its target. The underlying objective \u2014 to focus exclusively on price stability and use 2 per cent inflation as an operational guide \u2014 has been largely untouched.So why hasn\u2019t the case for change been more compelling?Officials at the Bank of Canada, whose next mandate renewal takes place in 2021, boil it down to a few things:\u2013 The system is not perfect, but the framework has been largely successful even with the recent difficulties in hitting the target. Price pressures and inflation expectations are stable, and economic cycles over the past two decades have been less volatile than has been historically the case.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Fed policy makers meet in Chicago this week to debate whether to change their inflation target.\n\nAl Drago/Bloomberg\n\n\u2013 One of the biggest benefits of inflation targeting is it\u2019s much easier to communicate, and for people to understand, than more complex approaches.\u2013 Perhaps more importantly is an acknowledgment that there is a false precision to the whole business of inflation targeting. Economics isn\u2019t an exact-enough science to really allow them to get it perfectly, which is why Canadian policy makers are happy to allow inflation to move within a range \u2014 1 per cent to 3 per cent \u2014 and would become worried only if they see a real risk of the band being breached. The 2 per cent \u201ctarget\u201d is simply the midpoint.\u201cFor now what we\u2019ve got is the inflation target and it\u2019s done a good job for us,\u201d is how Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz recently put it.On the idea of average inflation targeting being touted widely, for example, Poloz says it makes a lot of sense theoretically \u201cbut in practice, I\u2019d need to be persuaded myself.\u201d\u201cThe ability to let it cruise above 2 and know exactly when to prevent it from continuing on towards 3 is a lot harder than rocket science,\u201d said Poloz. It\u2019s \u201creally hard to pull off and risky on the upside.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean things won\u2019t change. Poloz and his main deputy overseeing the review, Carolyn Wilkins, seem to be open to new ideas, particularly given how monetary policy is becoming increasingly constrained by low interest rates and inflation. That\u2019s a world where the central bank has limited firepower to fight a recession, even as cheap money threatens to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis.As a result, the latest review underway at the Bank of Canada seems to be the most ambitious yet. Alternatives under consideration include raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate, targeting nominal GDP and even average inflation targeting.Yet, Canadian monetary policymakers are also quick to point out that there are limits to what central banks can do to solve all the economy\u2019s ills. Government policy too, they point out, has an important role, particularly in tackling structural issues.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Stephen Gandel, Commentary", "title": "Donald Trump's trade war has already cost investors up to $7 trillion", "description": "Trump's effort to reorient the U.S.'s place in world trade could end up being much more costly than most people think", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/trumps-trade-war-has-cost-investors-up-to-7-trillion?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 3, 2019 2:50 PM EDT", "content": "If you thought President Donald Trump\u2019s golf outings were expensive, wait until you see how much his trade war could cost investors and most likely already has.A double dose of troubling trade news late last week sent stocks sliding on Friday. That brought the drop for the month to 6.6 per cent, making it the worst May for the market since 2010 and the third worst if you go all the way back to early 1950s. And that\u2019s saying a lot. May is, after all, according to the traders\u2019 adage, the month where investors are supposed to go, and stay, away.\u00a0In the larger picture of the market of the Trump presidency, though, May\u2019s drop doesn\u2019t actually look so bad. Stock prices, as measured by the broad S&P 500 market index, are still up 27 per cent, including nearly 10 per cent in the first five months of this year. In fact, the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 1.3 per cent on Friday seemed kind of small in the wake of Trump\u2019s demand that Mexico curb immigration or face 25 per cent tariffs and China\u2019s threat that it could essentially ban some U.S. companies from doing any business there. That\u2019s led some to point to the market and make the case that a trade war with China and Mexico won\u2019t be so bad. \nMorgan Stanley sees recession within year if trade war gets any worse\nKevin Carmichael: Trump and trade wars loom over sunny economic outlook\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs would impact the U.S. economy\nBut that conclusion is short-sighted. The correct way to gauge how much economic damage the stock market thinks a trade war could inflict is to go back not a month but to when Trump really started talking tough on tariffs, first on steel and other metals, and then on China, in late January 2018. At that time, the Russell 3000, which captures more of the stock market than the S&P 500, was trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 19.3 based on the next 12 months of earnings. At that point, analysts hadn\u2019t fully factored into their estimates the corporate tax cut that had passed the month before. But by May, expected earnings for the Russell 3000 for 2019 had risen to nearly US$103 a share. Based on those expected earnings, and if the index had maintained its pre-trade war fears multiple, the Russell 3000 would be at 1,986, with a market cap for all the stocks in the index of US$36.2 trillion.But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, earnings estimates for the next 12 months have come down to US$98 a share, and the multiple has slumped to 16.6, giving the Russell \u2014 which is at 1,619 \u2014 a market capitalization of US$29.5 trillion. It is impossible to know if that nearly US$7 trillion difference can be attributed entirely to the trade war, and more than likely it cannot. Earnings estimates might have slumped anyway. Earlier this year, it looked as if interest rates were going to rise, which was also weighing on the stock market. Interest rates have instead dropped. And while the global economy has slowed, that could be trade-related as well. Bankim Chadha, the chief U.S. strategist at Deutsche Bank, put his estimate for the damage caused by the trade war at US$5 trillion.The market could also be overstating the potential damage from a trade war. The U.S. imports US$550 billion in goods from China. A 25 per cent tariff on those goods would raise prices by US$138 billion. Mexico imports total an additional US$400 billion, and a 25 per cent tariff on those goods, which is how far Trump has said he would go to curb immigration, would equal another US$90 billion, for a total of US$228 billion. That is, of course, only the cost of higher goods to consumers and for only one year. Trade wars have far-reaching effects. But still, that\u2019s a lot less than US$5 trillion or US$7 trillion. Nonetheless, the collective wisdom of investors has a better track record at predicting the future than most economists. And even if the true number is somewhere in between, Trump\u2019s effort to reorient the U.S.\u2019s place in world trade could end up being much more costly than most people think.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "Here's how Trump's Mexico tariffs would impact the U.S. economy", "description": "Economists say tariffs up the risk of recession", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/heres-how-trumps-mexico-tariffs-would-impact-the-u-s-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/trump-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 31, 2019 2:59 PM EDT", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico goods would eat into U.S. growth and increase the potential for a recession, according to several Wall Street economists.\u201cThis definitely adds risk to the downside,\u201d said Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Plc, which now expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage point later this year. \u201cIt throws global supply chains into question and contributes further to the uncertainty already weighing down business investment.\u201dThe impact on inflation from the Mexico tariffs would be higher than for the China levies, particularly for food, he said. \nBullion, gold shares shine after Trump\u2019s Mexico tariff declaration\nCanada\u2019s yield curve inverts the most in 12 years on Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs threat\nTrump\u2019s surprise tariff threat to Mexico threatens new NAFTA deal\nThat was the prognosis of multiple economists Friday, after Trump took many off guard by threatening to slap tariffs on imports from Mexico unless the country stops the flow of illegal immigration to the U.S. The levies would start June 10 and could reach as high as 25 per cent by October.The move may affect supply chains and prices as companies face higher charges on several fronts and pass them through to consumers, who account for the largest part of the economy. The U.S. imported about US$350 billion in goods from Mexico last year.

The weaker pace could sway the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice this year, he also said.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note to clients Friday that the administration will likely implement at least the first round of tariffs on Mexico goods, lowering the chances of the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada being enacted by the 2020 U.S. election.So far, American consumer sentiment is buoyant amid the trade war with China and ongoing negotiations with other partners including Europe and Japan, according to the University of Michigan. In addition, spending topped forecasts in April, according to government data Friday.At the same time, the Michigan sentiment reading was lower than a preliminary gauge amid an escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war.\u201cIf Mexico is on the table for additional tariffs, it\u2019s quite possible that other countries could be dragged into a larger trade dispute,\u201d Millar at Barclays said. \u201cThere are still Europe and Japan and it raises questions: if the administration is willing to have two simultaneous disputes, why stop there?

That would mark a fifth straight hold by the central bank since it last raised borrowing costs in October. Longer-term, most analysts predict rates won\u2019t rise again until next year at the earliest.It\u2019s a reflection of an economy, only just emerging from a serious slowdown, that\u2019s still too fragile to cope with higher rates. Businesses are spooked by global trade uncertainty. Low oil prices and transportation constraints have hobbled the crucial energy sector. Record debt levels are a dead weight on consumer spending.

They see an 80 per cent chance of one rate cut over the next 12 months. In the U.S., conviction on lower rates is even stronger, with at least two rate cuts priced in over that period.Still, the Bank of Canada has shown no inclination to loosen policy. For one, officials are wary of encouraging more borrowing in an economy already saddled with debt. Underlying price pressures, meanwhile, have been hovering around the 2 per cent target for more than a year. As recently as last week, Poloz continued to argue for the long-term need for higher rates.There are also federal elections. While the central bank in the past has adjusted rates in the months leading up to a general vote, policy makers would need to consider the political optics of any move \u2014 either up or down. That raises the bar for any change.The most likely reason for the Bank of Canada to be pulled off the sidelines before the October election would be an adverse global economic or financial event. This could take the form of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, a correction in global financial markets, a cut in rates by the Federal Reserve \u2014 or a combination of these.Outside of global developments, there aren\u2019t any obvious made-in-Canada triggers for Poloz to move in the next six months.The central bank has already cut its first-half growth forecast to below what most analysts expect. That means policy makers are unlikely to be disappointed enough by the data to contemplate a cut.Recent economic numbers on employment, housing and manufacturing have actually surprised to the upside \u2014 but no one believes a better-than-expected performance in the first six months of this year will be enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to seriously consider a hike.The Bank of Canada is more optimistic about the economy in the second half and into 2020, when it expects growth to sustainably return to more normal levels of about 2 per cent. If that scenario plays out, then rate hikes are possible. If the numbers disappoint, cuts could be on the table.\u201cThe battleground is going to be the third quarter,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada.

The Canadian yield curve is inverted, with three-month government debt yielding more than 10-year notes, suggesting fear the dispute will weigh on global growth. The rates market is pricing in 17 basis points of central bank easing through the next 12 months, according to trading of forward contracts.But the Bank of Canada has been resolute. Governor Stephen Poloz said May 17 that there\u2019s much evidence the economy is strong, calling signs to the contrary just a \u201cdetour\u201d and saying interest rates will rise once the headwinds dissipate.

And it\u2019s little wonder why: The U.S. and China are Canada\u2019s biggest trading partners.The BoC is \u201ccaught between big global uncertainties that are negative and recent data surprises erring on the positive side,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency in the U.S. and Canada for the market to take a more dovish view of expected policy than policy makers. The curve will be another element encouraging caution.\u201dAround the world, traders have pushed bond yields lower, as appetite for risk assets wanes and central banks around the globe cut forecasts for growth. The trade war has taken a toll on sentiment, weighing on global stocks and sapping demand for most commodities.The foreign-exchange market isn\u2019t pricing in a dovish central-bank policy stance in Canada just yet. As of Friday, the loonie was still the best performer among currencies from Group-of-10 nations in 2019, supported by crude oil, which had gained 30 per cent this year despite recent losses. The loonie was up 1.5 per cent this year versus the U.S. dollar.Still, the outlook is cloudy. For Canada, 17 per cent of its economic growth is exposed to the fight between the U.S. and China, according to a May 24 report from Bloomberg Intelligence economists. That means the Canadian dollar is 10 per cent overvalued, they argued.Recent economic data indicating strong Canadian employment and retail sales strengthen Poloz\u2019s optimistic position even after the central bank last month abandoned its bias toward rate hikes and dropped a reference to future increases.

However, it\u2019s difficult to know \u201chow loudly the alarm bell is ringing\u201d because the publicly released figures don\u2019t distinguish between cash flow and balance sheet insolvencies, the C.D. Howe Institute said in a blog posting.Balance sheet insolvency is when a person is still unable to pay off debts, even after selling off all of their assets. Cash flow insolvency, on the other hand, is when a person can\u2019t pay off debts because of difficulties selling their assets. Of the two, balance sheet insolvency is more serious. \nHold the panic: Maybe Canadians aren\u2019t facing a debt insolvency crisis after all\nAs bankruptcies rise, BoC\u2019s Poloz says he\u2019s listening to people\u2019s concerns about higher interest rates\nMore people are going broke in Canada as interest rates rise\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to sell your house at a moment\u2019s notice, but that\u2019s really a matter of being illiquid, and not what economists would typically think of as insolvency,\u201d said Jeremy Kronick, associate director of research at C.D. Howe and one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and not.\u201dThere's a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and notJeremy Kronick, C.D. Howe \n \nAlong with near-record debt-service ratios and rising borrowing costs, rising insolvencies are adding to concern about the sustainability of the country\u2019s lofty household debt levels. To determine how significant the increase in insolvencies is, Kronick argues data at the individual level is needed.No DistinctionThe Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies separates insolvencies into bankruptcies and so-called proposals, when a debtor agrees with creditors to pay off a certain portion of the debt over time. The OSB\u2019s monthly and quarterly reports give the volume of insolvencies, without disclosing liabilities and assets. It discloses those in its annual reports, but aggregated by city and region.\u201cBankruptcies and consumer proposals include both cash-flow and balance sheet insolvencies,\u201d a spokesman for the OSB said by email. \u201cNo distinction is made under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act between those two types of insolvencies.\u201dIn addition to calling for more detailed insolvency data, the researchers argue some of the warnings about Canada\u2019s rising debt loads may be overstated, given the country\u2019s debt-to-net worth ratio has stayed relatively constant at 20% since 2007, even though debt-to-GDP has risen to 100%, from 75%.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying all\u2019s well,\u201d Kronick said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to say there\u2019s a big difference that we should recognize, but we can\u2019t because we don\u2019t have enough here to tell us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed signals patience on rate moves \u2018for some time\u2019", "description": "No strong case to move in either direction", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/fed-minutes-signal-patience-on-rate-moves-for-some-time", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/federal-rserve.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 22, 2019 2:29 PM EDT", "content": "Federal Reserve officials judged at their latest meeting that their patient approach to interest-rate change would be appropriate \u201cfor some time,\u201d and many sided with Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s view that the recent dip in inflation was probably temporary.\u201cMembers observed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely remain appropriate for some time,\u201d according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s April 30-May 1 meeting released Wednesday in Washington.U.S. stocks remained lower and Treasuries held gains, as the minutes reinforced the message from Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference, at which he said the level of interest rates was appropriate for now and there wasn\u2019t a strong case to move in either direction. The record also showed officials becoming more optimistic about the U.S. 2019 economic outlook before President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. They also had a debate about the future composition of the bond portfolio.Many participants viewed the recent easing in inflation \u201cas likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 per cent objective,\u201d the minutes said.The Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of price pressures, excluding food and energy, slowed to a 1.6 per cent increase in the 12 months through March despite solid economic growth and a tight labour market.The FOMC at the meeting left its benchmark policy rate unchanged in a 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent target range and reiterated its pledge to be \u201cpatient\u201d in weighing future moves. The committee next gathers on June 18-19.Fed officials received a staff presentation on two approaches to adjusting the maturity composition of the central bank\u2019s portfolio. One approach would return the portfolio to a composition similar to outstanding Treasury securities, while another would result in a shorter-term maturity structure of three years or less.Portfolio DiscussionThe staff analysis showed that a move to the shorter-term portfolio \u201cwould put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook,\u201d the minutes said.In their discussion of a portfolio proportional to the Treasury market, \u201cparticipants observed that moving to this target\u201d of portfolio composition \u201cwould not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks.\u201dSeveral participants judged that the proportional approach would be \u201cwell aligned with the committee\u2019s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy.\u201d At the same time, some of the debate focused on how much capacity each strategy would allow for adding economic stimulus through a maturity extension program.Investors have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates later this year partly on concern over inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, which prices have done for most of the last seven years.On the economic outlook, \u201cmany participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated,\u201d according to the minutes.GDP expanded at a 3.2 per cent annual pace in the first quarter,surpassing expectations, and unemployment hit a 49-year low in April.

Not yet, but the head of the EDC has plans to get us there\nPoloz can resume the fight on inflation as the threat of a credit bust appears to recede\nEscalating U.S.-China trade spat to hit Canadian business confidence, wallop global economy\nThe comments underscore the governor\u2019s confidence that the nation\u2019s expansion remains on solid footing, and the economy will emerge from a recent soft patch. It\u2019s a view that puts him at odds with investors betting growth will slow further and that the central bank\u2019s next move will likely be a rate cut. Markets are placing odds of a cut over the next year at about 50 per cent.The Bank of Canada has raised borrowing costs five times since 2017, but recently indicated it won\u2019t move any higher for now amid a slowdown that brought growth to a near halt at the end of last year.Asked whether his recent dovish tilt was premature, Poloz said it was triggered by an abrupt and synchronous global slowdown, stoked by trade uncertainty, that has kept companies from investing. That required a cautious approach to policy, he said.\u201cThese are sentiment-driven, soft things,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t model that mechanically and expect to predict how much a trade war and rhetoric is going to affect those things.\u201dYet, if those trade concerns get resolved, the rebound could be swift.\u2018Positive\u2019 Scenario\u201cSentiment can turn around very quickly if there\u2019s a resolution,\u201d Poloz said. If \u201csentiment goes up, investment will recover and we\u2019re back into the positive scenario where I think the global economy can grow for a long time.\u201dPoloz also speculated some of the recent weakness in the data may be understating strength in services, particularly technology, that is more difficult to measure. He said the recent run of strong jobs data probably reflects a truer picture of the economy. Canada has added 426,400 jobs over the past 12 months, the largest one-year increase since 2007.\u201cOur traditional measures capture the stuff that you can drop on your foot much more easily than the service sector,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cThe good news is there is something positive happening in addition to a gradual rebuilding process, and so it\u2019s adding up to a pretty good picture, and probably the labour market is telling us the truth.\u201dGrowth in the services sector may also be fuelling increases in capacity that are keeping inflation in check, he said.Poloz also said he would \u201cfrown\u201d upon any weakening of mortgage qualification rules that are helping to improve the quality of new credit and slowing price appreciation in some markets like Toronto and Vancouver.Poloz, who is entering the final year of his seven-year term next month, was also asked whether he would agree to stay at the job longer if asked.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously one of the options,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of different scenarios we can sketch out.

Over the past two years, the economy has added 700,000 jobs.\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s a little more strength left in the Canadian economy,\u201d Brian DePratto, a senior economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said in a telephone interview.For months, the labour market had been the lone bright spot in a struggling economy, and was the only thing giving policy makers much comfort.We have a plan to grow our economy \u2013 and it\u2019s working.

But many of these elements have begun to reverse.Exporters showed across-the-board resiliency in March, after shipments tumbled in February. Toronto\u2019s housing market, the country\u2019s largest, is stabilizing after a recent slump. There are also signs consumers continue to spend and borrow, aided in large part by the strong labour market, even amid worries about the outlook.The job gains in April were broad-based \u2013 across industries, regions and demographics \u2014with few weaknesses. Most of the gains were full-time, up 73,000, and in the private sector. Both goods-producing and services sectors recorded gains.Even wages \u2013 which have been sluggish \u2013 are showing signs of life. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.5 per cent in April, the fastest annual gain since September, up from 2.4 per cent in March. Pay gains for permanent employees rose to 2.6 per cent, the strongest increase since August.Total hours worked also picked up, increasing by 1.3 per cent annually in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.The jobs increases have largely reflected higher labour force numbers as the economy pulls in new workers \u2013 youth and immigrants in particular \u2013 rather than falling unemployment. The number of people in the labour force jumped by 108,100 in April, also a one-month record, on a surge in youth participation.\u201cWe\u2019re drawing in people, and that tells you how tight the labour market is,\u201d Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics, said by phone.Regionally, there were gains in most provinces including Alberta, which saw 21,400 jobs created. Employment in Ontario jumped by 47,000 in April, with job increases in Canada\u2019s largest province at 205,000 over the past year. Quebec employment rose by 38,000, dropping its unemployment rate to 4.9 per cent, the lowest in data going back to 1976.Strong increases in youth employment also lowered the unemployment rate for that demographic to record lows.Erik Hertzberg and Josh Wingrove contributed to this report"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert and Jeff Kearns", "title": "Trump hails America\u2019s blockbuster GDP growth \u2014 'far higher than the high expectations'", "description": "But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-growth-of-3-2-tops-forecasts-on-trade-inventory-boost", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 26, 2019 3:11 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter on a big boost from inventories and trade that offset slowdowns in consumer and business spending, with President Donald Trump touting the report as much stronger than expected.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.2 per cent annualized rate in the January-March period, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey calling for 2.3 per cent growth.

U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components \u2014 inventories and trade \u2014 that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed\u2019s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation\u2019s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a \u201cgreat number,\u201d consumer spending \u201chas to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. \u201cWe think it will, but it\u2019s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.\u201dWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cWhile this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker \u2014 namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.\u201d \u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can\u2019t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed MeetingFed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday\u2019s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final\u00a0sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties.With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Shelly Hagan, Alyza Sebenius, Alister Bull and Justin SinkBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Stephen Poloz inverts Canada's yield curve by removing rate-hike bias", "description": "The decision pushed longer-term government bond yields lower, dropping them below short-term debt.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stephen-poloz-inverts-canadas-yield-curve-by-removing-rate-hike-bias?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/poloz-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 24, 2019 3:03 PM EDT", "content": "Stephen Poloz has inverted Canada\u2019s yield curve.

The survey provides insight into everything from investment intentions to the amount of slack in the economy and inflation expectations, and Monday\u2019s report was almost universally negative.More businesses reported their sales growth decelerated over the past 12 months, while expectations for future sales remained depressed.The share of companies reporting at least some difficulty in meeting increased demand fell to 31 per cent, the lowest since 2015. Readings on labour shortages also weakened to multi-year lows, while inflation expectations showed a marked softening. About two-thirds of all executives surveyed expect inflation won\u2019t surpass 2 per cent over the next two years.One positive is investment and employment intentions remain robust, even though there was some softening for these questions as well. Among those surveyed, 39 per cent said they expect to increase spending on machinery and equipment, which is about the historical average but down from recent levels. Almost half the executives surveyed said they expect to raise employment levels over the next 12 months.The survey also found expectations for growth in the U.S. moderating.

They also bring it more into line with the dovish tilt in global monetary policy. Over the past six weeks, Poloz and his officials have highlighted the need for continued stimulus amid a slowing economy and downplayed the notion they have a precise understanding of where rates would need to settle even if headwinds dissipate.\u2018Stimulative\u2019 PolicyEstimates of how high rates will eventually need to go are simply theoretical, and the actual \u201cneutral rate\u201d is an unknown, said Poloz. Regardless, headwinds exist and require the policy rate to remain stimulative, he said.At the last rate decision on March 6, \u201cwe said pretty clearly, conditions warrant a rate of interest below neutral,\u201d Poloz said . \u201cSo it\u2019s obvious that we\u2019re still working on some headwinds or things that are keeping the economy getting all the way home. That\u2019s as far as I can go at this stage.\u201dA good indication of how the economy is doing comes later Monday, when the central bank releases the spring edition of its Business Outlook Survey and Senior Loan Officer Survey, the institution\u2019s last major publications before the April 24 rate announcement and quarterly Monetary Policy Report.

The 2019 growth rate would be the weakest since 2009, when the world economy shrank. It\u2019s the third time the IMF has downgraded its outlook in six months.The global volume of trade in goods and services will increase 3.4 per cent this year, weaker than the 3.8 per cent gain in 2018 but reduced from the IMF\u2019s January estimate of 4 per cent, the fund\u2019s report showed.Global economic growth will recover in the second half of this year, before plateauing at 3.6 per cent from next year, according to the Washington-based fund. A series of encouraging developments have boosted optimism about the world economy in recent weeks, including the decision of the Federal Reserve to put interest-rate hikes on hold and encouraging data from China\u2019s manufacturing sector and the U.S. job market.Still, the IMF is warning that risks are skewed to the downside, with a range of threats menacing the global economy, including the possible collapse of negotiations between the U.S. and China to end their trade war, and the departure of Britain from the European Union without a transition agreement, known as the \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit scenario. \nTrade tensions flare as Trump threatens new EU tariffs on jetliners, helicopters, motorcycles, cheese, wine \u2026\nWTO says tariff war will hammer global trade growth this year\nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: The latest charts that matter most to the Bank of Canada\n\u201cAmid waning global growth momentum and limited policy space to combat downturns, avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity needs to be the main priority,\u201d the IMF said.IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde is warning that the world economy faces a \u201cdelicate moment\u201d as finance ministers and central bankers prepare to gather in the U.S. capital this week for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.While intense trade talks between the U.S. and China have raised expectations of a lasting truce between the world\u2019s two-largest economies, analysts remain worried about the strength of the global economy, a decade after the financial crisis. Lagarde said last week the fund doesn\u2019t anticipate a recession in the near-term.U.S. DowngradeThe fund cut its forecast for U.S. growth to 2.3 per cent this year, down 0.2 percentage point since the IMF\u2019s last global outlook in January. The downgrade reflects the impact of the partial government shutdown that ended in January, as well as lower-than-expected public spending. The fund upgraded its U.S. forecast next year to 1.9 per cent, up 0.1 percentage point, on the Fed\u2019s shift to a more patient stance on interest rates.The IMF slashed its outlook for the euro area to 1.3 per cent this year, down 0.3 point from three months ago. Growth is expected to be softer in several major European economies, including Germany, where weak global demand and tougher car-emission standards have hit factory production. Weak domestic demand and high sovereign-debt spreads have dimmed Italy\u2019s outlook, while street protests in France weighed on growth, the fund said.The IMF cut its outlook for U.K. growth to 1.2 per cent this year, down 0.3 points from three months ago.The IMF raised its forecast for Chinese growth by 0.1 point to 6.3 per cent this year, while lowering its projection for growth in Japan by 0.1 point to 1 per cent.

It\u2019s a sign of investors\u2019 hunger for yield in a world where bonds from some developed nations have negative interest rates.\u201cThis deal should do extremely well,\u201d said Anthony Simond, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc In London. \u201cThe company appeals to more than one type of investor. Firstly emerging market debt funds and secondly global investment grade investors.\u201dThe bond sale is largely seen as Plan B to raise money for the kingdom\u2019s economic agenda after the initial public offering of Aramco was postponed until at least 2021 from an initial 2018 target. In effect, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the country day-to-day, is using the state oil producer\u2019s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions.For Saudi Arabia, the strong demand for the debt of its state oil company will comfort the country\u2019s wealthy royal family, which has been in crisis mode since the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. The murder, which U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by Prince Mohammed himself, triggered a global uproar that prompted Wall Street banks, investors and business tycoons to give the kingdom a cold shoulder.An investment summit in Riyadh that month dubbed \u201cDavos in the Desert\u201d was mostly boycotted by its A-list participants. Yet, little by little, the power of money has attracted Wall Street again, first at the real World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where bank bosses said it was time to let the kingdom out of the penalty box. And later in the bond market itself, where the Saudi government successfully raised debt this year.The Aramco bond sale will be final confirmation of the turnaround for the Middle Eastern nation. The company told investors it would sell debt in six portions, from three to 30 years, according to the people familiar with the matter.\u201cThe market shows no signs of wishing to balk at the latent political risk attached to Saudi,\u201d said Anthony Peters, a strategist at Blockex Ltd. In London.In a rare development for a state-owned company, Aramco could be on track to pay less for its debt than the Saudi government, the same people said, asking not to be named before the bond pricing later on Tuesday.The anticipated low pricing and strong order book underscores the financial strength of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 and most profitable \u2014 oil company. In the last few months, only companies such as telecommunications and media conglomerate Comcast Corp. and pharmaceutical giant CVS Health Corp. have drawn similar, or larger, interest from investors. Comcast attracted US$88 billion in orders in 2018, while CVS peaked at what\u2019s consider a record for any company: US$121 billion.With strong demand, Aramco told investors it expects to pay about 1.25 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries for its 10-year notes, compared with Saudi sovereign bonds trading at about 1.27 percentage points. Traditionally, those risk premiums fall in a high-demand bond sale as the process advances, suggesting Aramco may pay even less.Investors will be watching closely to see how much the pricing tightens at the next stage of the process. Such has been the massive response to the deal, the company has opted not to give any further price indications until after the book has closed, which is due around 11 a.m. London time.This isn\u2019t the first time Saudi Arabia has turned to debt markets since the death of Khashoggi. In January, the nation sold US$7.5 billion in international bonds, the first sign that the outcry hadn\u2019t stifled foreign investors\u2019 interest in the country.Aramco has lined up a roster of international banks supporting its jumbo bond deal, another indication of how the mood in Wall Street toward the kingdom has changed. The banks not only want to participate on the bond sale, but also ensure they\u2019re well placed in case Aramco goes ahead with its planned IPO.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s chief executive officer, spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one person familiar with the matter. Last year, Dimon and others skipped the investment conference in Riyadh, but still sent senior bankers to make sure they kept their contacts with the kingdom.JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are managing the bond sale along with Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, and NCB Capital Co.

He cited recent data \u2014 the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January \u2014 to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.\u201cThere are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.\u201dYield CurvePoloz\u2019s comments are the first since a segment of Canada\u2019s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada\u2019s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need \u2014 at least over time \u2014 for rates to move higher. He didn\u2019t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada\u2019s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term \u2014 unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Positive ToneIn his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy\u2019s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to \u201cpositive growth\u201d later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will \u201ceventually be completed.\u201d Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials \u201cthey need to make new investments,\u201d aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.\u201cWe only have to look back a few years for an example,\u201d said Poloz, \u201cfollowing the oil price collapse of 2015.\u201dHe also cited \u201cnumerous advantages\u201d beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth \u2014 including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a \u201cportfolio\u201d of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials \u2014 after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector \u2014 can \u201csee many areas of encouraging economic growth\u201d in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.\u201cThese data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cJudging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of the inverted yield curve?

That was the biggest quarterly gain in three years for the Canadian index.The Canadian dollar also rallied, making the loonie the best performing currency among developed nations this year, with a 2 per cent gain. Even stocks soared amid the recession fears \u2014 the main equity gauge had its best quarter in almost a decade, up 13 per cent. \n\u2018Financial markets are starting to bend\u2019: What the inverted yield curve means for Canadians\nBank of Canada\u2019s Stephen Poloz gets chance today to put rate cut speculation on ice\nFor those who can\u2019t print money, an inverted yield curve is not something to trifle with\nInvestors are lapping up Canadian assets even after the yield curve inverted. This shift, when longer-term interest rates dip below short-term yields, often signals that a recession looms and that policy makers will be forced to lower borrowing costs.Canada\u2019s economy is clearly slowing though growth for January \u2014 at an annualized rate of 1.6 per cent \u2014 was better than economists expected. The numbers released Friday by Statistics Canada paint a much less bleak picture for an economy that came to a near halt at the end of last year. Bank of Montreal nudged its forecast higher for first-quarter growth on the back of the report, to 0.5 per cent.\u201cIt boils down to what the curve is actually implying,\u201d Darcy Briggs, a portfolio manager at Franklin Bissett Investment Management, said from Toronto. \u201cIf it\u2019s a slow patch, corporates will probably drift around, spreads may drift a little bit lower.\u201dThe drop in yields have been sparked by expectations the Bank of Canada will pause its tightening cycle after five interest rate increases. If there is any move in rates this year, it\u2019s more likely to be a cut, based on trading in the swaps market. Chances of a rate cut at the Bank of Canada meeting in September have risen to about 37 per cent, from 20 per cent earlier in March, according to swaps rates. Traders assign a zero per cent chance of a hike by then.\u201cI would put the root cause of the outperformance of Canadian credit basically on the posture of the Bank of Canada \u2014 there\u2019s a risk that it can actually cut rates now so we\u2019ve seen the yield curve come down,\u201d said Philip Petursson, the chief investment strategist at Toronto-based Manulife Investments.Over the course of this year, Petursson expects that trimming equity holdings and shifting into fixed income will make sense.\u201cAt the very least, you\u2019re clipping a coupon that is much more attractive today than where we were a year ago,\u201d he said.Petursson sees the Canadian stock benchmark trading in line with the S&P 500 and international equities, estimating returns in the mid-single digits over the next 12 months as a result of more modest earnings growth. For fixed income, he expects a similar return profile of mid-single digits, assuming interest rates fall.\u201cInvestment grade corporate debt as well as high yield is attractive relative to equities over the next six to 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we look further into 2020, sovereign debt may hold a certain appeal.\u201dFranklin\u2019s Briggs expects returns for the Canadian bond market of about 2 per cent to 4 per cent if the curve inversion is just signalling a slow patch ahead.\u201cIf it\u2019s something worse, such as a sharp slowdown or a recession, my guesstimate is that we could see rates move lower and returns in bonds go higher by anywhere from 3 to 6 per cent,\u201d he said.Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices, so lower yields boost returns.Energy RallyMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s energy sector is finally getting some love. Big oil and pipeline companies are the biggest gainers in the Canadian bond market this year, with the top performer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. rising three times more than other companies as higher oil prices bolster earnings prospects.\u201cCanadian oil companies are strong and they\u2019re very disciplined,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThey\u2019re like the rest of us, waiting for some policy certainty, but they\u2019re in the best seat to capitalize on all of this.

A segment of Canada\u2019s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time since 2007. Investors now see a strong chance of a cut by the Bank of Canada over the next 12 months.This raises a major challenge for Poloz, one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need \u2014 at least over time \u2014 for rates to move higher.

Poloz \u201ccould take one more turn of the dovish screw, I suppose, by going completely neutral \u2014 although I believe it would be more appropriate to do that at the next decision date. \u201dThe gap between Canadian three-month and 10-year rates went negative on March 21, tracking a similar move in the U.S. For investors predicting a recession south of the border, it wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched to assume Canada would be pulled into one as well. All of the country\u2019s last eight recessions have coincided with contractions in the U.S.Last StatementsThe Bank of Canada hasn\u2019t said much during the recent turbulence. Its last public communication was a March 14 speech by Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins in which she highlighted the vulnerabilities created by global leverage but said the central bank expects the worldwide expansion to continue and Canada\u2019s economic growth to pick up after a weaker-than-expected first half.Her comments reiterated language from the central bank\u2019s decision on March 6, when it left rates unchanged and toned down its conviction that interest rates need to go higher, while sticking to an overall hiking stance.Poloz\u2019s speech, titled the \u201cImportance of Trade,\u201d will be published at 2:55 p.m. Ottawa time. Iqaluit is situated 195 miles south of the Arctic Circle.Even as markets continue to bet on cuts, the data is mixed enough to keep Poloz on the sidelines for the foreseeable future. The latest gross domestic product data show the economy expanded at a 0.3 per cent pace in January, painting a less bleak picture than feared. Growth is tracking an annualized first-quarter pace of more than 1 per cent, a big improvement from the previous quarter\u2019s 0.4 per cent.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cThe Canadian expansion faces a host of challenges in 2019. Escalating global risks and weaker-than-expected GDP at year-end signal below-trend growth this year. This means inflationary pressures should be subdued, which will allow the Bank of Canada to pause on its path back to neutral to assess the changing landscape.\u201dThe Bank of Canada will release a new set of quarterly economic forecasts at its April meeting that will likely be revised down. In January, it forecast growth of 2 per cent in 2018 and 1.7 percent this year. The 2018 number came in at 1.8 per cent. Economists have since lowered estimates for 2019 closer to 1.5 per cent.Neutral RatePolicy makers will also use the April meeting to review their neutral interest rate forecast \u2014 a key variable for plotting decisions. The measure is used to gauge how stimulative the policy rate is: the bigger the gap between the actual rate and the neutral rate, the more stimulative the policy, while a smaller gap would indicate fewer hikes are required. A downward revision would imply current policy is tighter than previously assumed.Until now, the central bank has estimated the neutral rate is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada emerges from slump with best growth gain in eight months", "description": "The unexpected gain paints a much less bleak picture for an economy than we have been seeing lately", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-emerges-from-slump-with-best-gdp-gain-in-eight-months?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/pjt-canadian_flag-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 29, 2019 11:13 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy began 2019 with its largest output gain in eight months, an unexpected result that will ease worries the expansion has come to a halt.Gross domestic product grew by 0.3 per cent in January, faster than the 0.1 per cent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

U.S. stocks recorded their steepest December losses since the Great Depression as President Donald Trump publicly hammered Powell to stop raising rates and investors saw the Fed\u2019s projected hikes as a policy mistake.Stocks have rebounded since the Fed made a dovish pivot in January, replacing a reference to further gradual rate increases with a pledge for patience. Wednesday marked policy makers\u2019 first opportunity since December to lay out in quarterly forecasts the extent to which their projections for hikes have changed.Economic growth \u201chas slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,\u201d the FOMC said in its statement. \u201cJob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months\u201d despite \u201clittle changed\u201d payrolls in February. \u201cOverall inflation has declined,\u201d though excluding food and energy it \u201cremains near 2 per cent,\u201d the central bank said.Policymakers also lowered economic-growth projections for this year and next, giving a 2.1 per cent median estimate for 2019, a full percentage point below last year\u2019s pace.The less upbeat assessment in the statement compared with January\u2019s language saying growth was solid, consumer spending was strong and business investment had moderated.The projections showed 11 of 17 officials saw no hikes this year, while four expected one rate increase and two people projected two hikes. Policymakers expect to lift rates once in 2020, to 2.6 per cent by the end of that year, and hold them steady in 2021.That compares with a December projection for a 3.1 per cent rate in 2020 and 2021, with borrowing costs converging to 2.75 per cent in the longer run, according to the median path. That long-run estimate was unchanged in Wednesday\u2019s forecasts.The Fed formally adopted its 2 per cent inflation goal in 2012, and price gains have mostly come in on the low side since then.Policymakers slightly lowered their expectations for inflation relative to their last set of economic projections. After 1.8 per cent headline inflation in 2019, they see price gains of 2 per cent on both the main and core indexes for the next two years, eliminating the overshoot they had previously projected.Officials see unemployment at 3.7 per cent by year-end, higher than their previous estimate of 3.5 per cent.

Back then, the country was revving up from the financial crisis and oil was over US$100 a barrel.Now, the nation may already be in recession after growing at an annualized pace of just 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter and a pretty \u201csoggy\u201d start to the year, said Wolf, part of the asset allocation team at Fidelity Investments Canada, which manages about $136 billion. He stressed his views were his own, not the firm\u2019s.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that those stars are going to be misaligned,\u201d Wolf said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \nDavid Rosenberg: Don\u2019t let \u2018blockbuster\u2019 job numbers fool you, Canada is one rung away from recession\nCanada\u2019s income tax rates have become uncompetitive, and the economy will pay the price\nWhy central banks \u2014 including Canada\u2019s \u2014 are finding it so hard to get interest rates back to \u2018normal\u2019 territory\nThe big problem for Canada is that a household deleveraging appears to be starting just as the global economy is slowing, said Wolf, who was an adviser at the Bank of Canada before joining Fidelity in 2014. Home values fell nationwide last year for the first time since at least 1990, while household debt burdens touched a record high. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s competitiveness problems remain, he said.\u201cIt may not meet that technical definition, but it could very well feel like a recession for a big part of the economy,\u201d said David Tulk, an institutional portfolio manager who works with Wolf. History has shown that it takes a \u201clong, long\u201d time to restore household balance sheets, a situation that will be all that more difficult with trade and business spending hampered, he said.Wolf and Tulk said it\u2019s hard to say how long or deep Canada\u2019s slowdown will be.\u201cYou\u2019ve never had debt levels as high, relative to incomes in Canada,\u201d said Tulk. Even if the Bank of Canada has stopped raising rates, \u201cthere\u2019s still kind of a big bulge in the python, so to speak, in terms of prior increases in interest rates and prior actions.\u201dWhile Canada\u2019s job market has been on fire, posting its best start to the year since 1981, Tulk points out said the gauge is a lagging indicator; hours worked have receded. Business investment in the final three months of 2018 meanwhile, fell 5.9 per cent from the first quarter of last year, and 22 per cent below record high levels in 2014.Wolf has been bearish on the loonie in the past. Lately, he\u2019s getting some company. Toronto-Dominion Bank downgraded its forecast on Friday, seeing at within a range of 74 U.S. cents to 71 U.S. cents for much of this year. Citigroup technical strategists are targeting 73.52 US cents to 72.99. The median of analyst forecasts\u2019 compiled by Bloomberg puts the loonie at 77.52 U.S. cents in the fourth quarter of the year.One option to shield investors from potential shakeout of Canadian assets is to replace some of them with emerging markets, which are cheaper and have better long term growth prospects, said Wolf.With assistance from Theophilos ArgitisBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "What gives?

Most economists expect the sluggishness to persist in the first six months of this year, before growth picks up steam later in 2019.The jobs increase largely reflects higher labor force numbers, rather than falling unemployment, due to rising participation rates and accelerating population growth over the past couple of years. Much of the increase in Canada\u2019s population comes from international working-age migrants. In an economy with more than half a million vacant jobs, many seem to be finding work.The labour force increased by 55,100 in February, and is up by 159,000 so far this year. Canada\u2019s jobless rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent, even with the employment gains, because more people were looking for work.The breakdown in the numbers was also positive, with 67,400 new full-time jobs offsetting a loss of 11,600 part-time positions.Even the wage picture is looking better. Annual average hourly gains accelerated to 2.3 per cent in February from 2 per cent a month earlier, with pay for permanent employees up 2.2 per cent, from 1.8 per cent previously.One weakness was total hours worked, which fell 0.1 per cent in February from a year earlier.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "The spark set to ignite Canada\u2019s next big corporate credit shakeout looms as companies pile on too much debt", "description": "'Cheap loans, high leverage and an abundance of capital really for the last decade is the gasoline'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/pot-banker-infor-adds-restructuring-team-as-debt-shakeout-looms", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/lit-match.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2019 7:25 PM EST", "content": "Infor Financial Group Inc., an independent investment bank, is preparing for a major shakeout in corporate credit as Canadian companies pile on too much debt.After more than 10 years without a major corporate failure, banks are \u201caggressively\u201d expanding into corporate loans, adding to a debt pile built on the back of ultra-low interest rates, said Infor founding partner Neil Selfe.

Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country\u2019s second and fifth largest banks, bolstered provisions in the last fiscal quarter, citing a rise in corporate arrears among the reasons.Canadian companies\u2019 interest expenses almost doubled this decade to $10.8 billion (US$8.1 billion) at the end of the year from $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to government data. While interest revenues that companies get from their interest bearing investments were at $18.7 billion in the last quarter of 2018, the rate of interest expenses jumped three times faster than revenue from interest bearing investments.Credit to Canadian businesses rose in the last 12 months through January by 6.1 per cent to $2.18 trillion, while lending to households expanded 3.1 per cent and reached $2.16 trillion, according to Bank of Canada data. Lenders are expanding credit to companies even as the country\u2019s economic growth almost stalled in the last quarter of 2018 as consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing investment fell by the most in a decade, business spending dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.Business Ramp UpInfor is getting ready \u2014 it\u2019s hired veteran restructuring expert Paul Liebovitz, who is already advising publicly listed companies in the renegotiation of their debt facilities, Selfe said, declining to provide the name of the firm. Infor is also turning to pension funds and insurance companies to fund debtor-in-possession loans, a type of credit for distressed companies, said Selfe.\u201cThere were very few, if any DIP providers in Canada\u201d said Selfe. \u201cThis is one of the areas that we think is a ripe opportunity.\u201dWhile companies in the mining and oil & gas sectors have been in a downturn for several years, the restructurings could be expanded into some of the suppliers of those industries as well as services firms, said Selfe. Also, some \u2018veteran\u2019 services industries, or manufactured or sport or niche manufacturing industries, may also being forced to reorganize their balance sheet.\n\nInfor Financial Group founding partner Neil Selfe.\n\nNational Post files\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often very, very little left if they hit the wall.

For that to happen there should be a closing of the current gap between the values that \u201csmall players think they\u2019re worth and what the larger players are now willing to pick them up,\u201d he said.\u201cWe do think there\u2019s a few mid tier players that will still pick-up Canadian assets and we\u2019ll try to push into that top ten,\u201d said Selfe.

In that period, little has gone right for the world\u2019s biggest economies: Weakness in the euro area and China are proving more persistent, trade growth has slowed sharply and uncertainty over Brexit has continued.\u201cThe global expansion continues to lose momentum,\u201d the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said as it downgraded almost every Group of 20 nation\u2019s economy. \u201cGrowth outcomes could be weaker still if downside risks materialize or interact.\u201d \nWith the Bank of Canada about to decide interest rates \u2026 just how vulnerable are Canadians to debt?\nWe\u2019re getting a look at the true state of Canada\u2019s economy \u2014 and it\u2019s no world beater\nCanada\u2019s economy practically grinds to a halt \u2014 and nobody saw it coming\nThe OECD\u2019s numbers are more downbeat than the IMF\u2019s for many economies, particularly the euro region and the U.K., as the organization warns that things could get worse.However, there have been some small signs recently that the global economy is stabilizing, while the U.S. and China are making progress on ending their lengthy trade dispute. JPMorgan\u2019s global composite Purchasing Managers Index rose in February for the first time in three months, while some euro-area gauges were also better than anticipated.\u201cGetting a clear steer on global growth is very difficult right now, but at least, the latest PMIs have some positives,\u201d HSBC economist James Pomeroy said in a note on Wednesday.Central banks including the Federal Reserve have already responded to the changed circumstances, and the European Central Bank may soon follow. China, forced to lower its goal for economic growth this week, has rolled out tax cuts to stimulate its economy.The OECD outlook goes against hopes that sources of weakness at the end of 2018, including lower confidence, would prove temporary. That creates a headache for policy makers who may now need to find more combative solutions with limited room for maneuver on the fiscal and monetary side.While central banks should stay in expansionary mode, the group called for structural reforms and fiscal stimulus in the European countries that could afford it, saying that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot resolve the downturn in Europe or improve the modest medium-term growth prospects.\u201dThe OECD cut its growth outlook for this year to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent. ECB policy makers are meeting in Frankfurt this week, and the OECD said they should signal a delay to any rate hikes and possibly implement new measures to improve funding for banks. Both measures are expected to be discussed in Frankfurt on Thursday.Europe took the brunt of the downgrades. While the U.S. outlook was lowered slightly, the U.K.\u2019s 2019 forecast was cut to 0.8 per cent from 1.4 per cent, and Germany\u2019s to 0.7 per cent from 1.6 per cent.The OECD also singled out Brexit as one of the persistent threats.

Gross says he lived most of his life unaware of the condition and now believes it helps explain not only why he was such a successful investor for so long but also why he could, by his own admission, rub people the wrong way.Gross, long one of the most vocal critics of post-crisis stimulus, now sounds like a near-convert to modern monetary theory. He says deflation poses a huge challenge for central banks, admires what Japan has done to revive its moribund economy and thinks the U.S. government should consider doubling the size of its deficit. \nBill Gross, the Bond King that racked up one of the longest winning streaks of any money manager, retires\nHere\u2019s why Bill Gross\u2019s fund lost a huge $153 million in the first half of the year\nBill Gross\u2019s slumping bond fund sees $580 million in outflows this year amid dismal performance\nAnd the billionaire and registered Republican agrees with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that the rich should pay more in taxes \u2014 if not quite the 70 per cent she\u2019s proposing at the margin. It\u2019s a \u201cnecessary evil\u201d to correct the failings of American capitalism, Gross says, adding that if inequality persists there\u2019ll be a \u201crevolution at the ballot box.\u201dHe even muses on who might inherit his onetime title of king of the bond market.Last DayGross, 74, shared the revelations in a 90-minute interview with Bloomberg Television at his office in Newport Beach, California. He touched on everything from recession risks to a recent round of golf with discount-brokerage pioneer Chuck Schwab as he counted down the hours to his official retirement. Friday will be his last as a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson Group Plc, the firm he joined in 2014.It\u2019s been 48 years since William Hunt Gross, an Ohio native, Duke University graduate, Navy veteran and blackjack whiz, started as an investment analyst at Pacific Mutual Life. He went on to co-found Pacific Investment Management Co. in 1974 and played the starring role as Pimco grew to become one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, overseeing more than US$2 trillion at its peak. His Pimco Total Return Fund so reliably beat its bond-market rivals that he was dubbed \u201cthe bond king.\u201d\n\nBill Gross at Pimco in 2000.\n\nMarc Solomon/Bloomberg files\n\nMore recently, Gross has had less to celebrate. After feuding with his Pimco partners over strategy, succession and managerial control, Gross was ousted in 2014. His second act at Janus was a headline-making dud as poor returns spurred withdrawals. His three-decade marriage fell apart in a split so acrimonious it became fodder for tabloids thousands of miles away.\u2018Different Universes\u2019That\u2019s a lot for anyone to take, let alone a portfolio manager responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in client money. Yet Gross says he was able to maintain focus and doesn\u2019t blame his personal ordeals for poor investment decisions.\u201cI\u2019m an Asperger, and Aspergers can compartmentalize,\u201d he said, revealing his diagnosis publicly for the first time. \u201cThey can operate in different universes without the other universes affecting them as much. Yeah, I had a nasty divorce, and I still had, you know, feelings about Pimco. But I think I did pretty well in compartmentalizing them. Not that I didn\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night and start damning one side or the other. But when I came to work it was all business.\u201dShared CharacteristicsThe reason he failed to deliver better returns at Janus is much simpler: \u201cI made some bad trades.\u201dGross learned he has Asperger\u2019s only after reading Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe Big Short.\u201d In one passage, Lewis recounts the unusual characteristics of one of the book\u2019s heroes, Michael Burry, a doctor-turned-investor who also was diagnosed with the condition as an adult. Gross recognized that he shared many of the same qualities and had similarly obsessive habits. He went to a psychiatrist, who confirmed the condition.\n\nBill Gross in 1994.\n\nKRT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to stay at 30,000 feet as opposed to being on the ground,\u201d Gross said, discussing why he thinks Asperger\u2019s probably made him a better investor, if also infamously short-tempered. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily good in terms of one-to-one. People think you\u2019re angry or an a-hole or whatever. But it helps you to focus on the longer-term things without getting mixed up in the details.\u201dSecret DiagnosisThat\u2019s the Bill Gross his former colleagues at Pimco will recognize. For years, they found him aloof, volatile and seemingly lacking in empathy. Symptoms of the disorder range widely, according to the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and can include degrees of difficulty with social interactions and communication, as well as deeply focused thinking and a preference for consistency and order.Gross kept his diagnosis a secret, sharing it with close friends, and dropping only one hint publicly. In a February 2016 blog post on investing, Gross speculated as to why he wasn\u2019t included as a character in Lewis\u2019s best-seller: \u201cPerhaps I wasn\u2019t addled enough like co-star hedge fund manager Michael Burry, who I share affection for and an affliction (and it\u2019s not a glass eye).\u201dWhile Gross says he\u2019s \u201csort of proud\u201d of his condition because \u201cit explains a lot about me,\u201d he no longer believes it\u2019s as much of an advantage professionally.\u201cThe markets are substantially different today than they were when I started, more day-to-day, more robotic, more machine-dominated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a negative, but it\u2019s probably not as much of a positive.\u201dDeficit CriticAs a bond-market investor, Gross had to have views on monetary and fiscal policy, and he shared them publicly in the investment outlooks he posted regularly on Pimco\u2019s website and, later, on Janus\u2019s. One consistent thread was a critique of budget deficits, zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing. He wrongly predicted they\u2019d spark runaway inflation and hurt returns on stocks and bonds.Now, Gross appears to be revisiting those views. Although he still believes low-rate policies destroy the risk-reward relationship in a market economy, he recognizes that the government and the Federal Reserve can work together to combat deflationary forces like America\u2019s aging population and Amazon.com.\u201cWhy can\u2019t the government have a US$2-trillion deficit if the Fed is simply going to buy it, like they do in Japan?\u201d Gross said. \u201cWell, Jim Grant would say, \u2018Mmm, it would be inflationary.\u2019 But it hasn\u2019t been. So, yeah, I would say Trump or the next president, whoever he or she is, could go to US$2 trillion, as long as the Fed was willing to accommodate.\u201dRestoring BalanceThis clearly isn\u2019t the Bill Gross of 2012, who declared the \u201ccult of equity\u201d dead and predicted an \u201cage of inflation.\u201d He describes his politics as increasingly liberal, and he jokes that he re-registered as a Republican just to pass muster at his country club.Gross believes tax rates on high earners need to be raised to restore balance in American capitalism and fund benefits for the middle class, such as access to affordable health care. That\u2019s why he\u2019s sympathetic to Ocasio-Cortez, the congressional freshman who has energized the left wing of the Democratic Party, even if he doesn\u2019t agree with all her ideas.\u201cMaybe the next time, the next election, there will be a \u2018socialist\u2019 in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wealthy have been advantaged for a long time and certainly the past few years with the tax cuts. The middle class hasn\u2019t necessarily suffered, but the gap has increased.\u201dDiffering BillionairesThe question is how heavy the tax burden should be. Other billionaires, such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC\u2019s Howard Marks, have warned against the consequences of \u201cconfiscatory taxes.\u201d Gross says a top marginal rate of 70 per cent \u2014 the number floated by Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 would be too high.\u201cI just think Trump took it too far,\u201d he said.Gross himself has a fortune the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates at US$1.4 billion. He plans to manage that money and the US$500 million in his foundation as a one-man family office. Gross said he\u2019ll do so \u201cconservatively,\u201d investing in closed-end funds and municipal bonds and continuing with one of his favourite trades, selling options on market volatility.New RoutineHis routine, if all goes according to plan, will have him starting at 6:30 or 7 a.m., keeping at it for two or three hours, and then playing a round of golf.Gross said he wants to be remembered for investing clients\u2019 savings profitably and helping to build a \u201cwealth-creating machine\u201d at Pimco. That leaves only one question: Will there be another bond market king?Probably not, according to Gross. One reason is the proliferation of passive investment vehicles. Anyone who claims to be a king of index funds is \u201cjust a puppet because the market is making the decisions.\u201d Gross volunteered that he wouldn\u2019t pick Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive officer and co-founder of DoubleLine Capital who\u2019s frequently cited as the new king. If anyone, he said it might be Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, in part because of his \u201cgreat long-term perspective.\u201d\u201cIn the right environment, 20 years ago, he could have been a bond king,\u201d Gross said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got the market or maybe the willingness to be a king. Who would? Well, I guess I did. In retrospect it carries a certain burden. The crown is heavy.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s economy practically grinds to a halt \u2014 and nobody saw it coming", "description": "Data reveals much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/weaker-gdp-than-anyone-expected-shows-canadian-growth-stalling?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/flag.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 1, 2019 11:50 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018, in a much deeper-than-expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt.The country\u2019s economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, for an annualized pace of 0.4 per cent, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. That\u2019s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years, down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase.While a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices, it\u2019s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector. Consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing fell by the most in a decade, business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.The only thing that kept the nation\u2019s economy from contracting was a build-up in inventories as companies stockpiled goods.At the very least, the numbers suggest that heightened uncertainty \u2014 everything from the impact of higher interest rates to potential trade wars and oil-sector woes \u2014 has made a real impact on both consumer and business sentiment. The question now is what the weaker-than-expected data suggests about the economy\u2019s ability to rebound back to more normal growth levels. \nOops, Statistics Canada appears to have released today\u2019s key economic data almost half an hour early\nCanada\u2019s big banks feel the pain from the stock market\u2019s swoon\nOur debt-clogged world is just one shock away from tipping into recession\nWhat Canadians need to see in the Federal budget: David Rosenberg\nMost economists had been expecting the soft patch would come to an end by this spring and growth would accelerate closer to 2 per cent for the rest of the year. No one, however, expected the economy would need to come back from such a low point. The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest forecast, from January, is for annualized growth of 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, before the expansion accelerates back to above 2 per cent growth by next year.Until recently, the economy had been doing relatively well even in the face of higher rates. It grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3 per cent in 2017, and expanded at a healthy clip in the first half of last year \u2014 prompting the Bank of Canada to press ahead with higher borrowing costs.But even that strength had been overstated, with Statistics Canada revising down its estimates for first half growth to 2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. For all of 2018, the economy grew by 1.8 per cent \u2014 below the Bank of Canada\u2019s estimate for 2 per cent. Monthly data released Friday show the economy ended the year contracting, with December gross domestic product down 0.1 per cent.\u00a0The data suggest rising interest rates may be having a bigger impact on consumers than expected. Consumption slowed to an annualized 0.7 per cent pace in the four quarter, the weakest growth since the start of 2015 as households increased their savings.Business investment also disappointed, with non-residential capital spending down an annualized 10.9 per cent \u2014 the third straight quarterly decline and the second consecutive drop of more than 10 per cent. Residential investment also contracted for a second straight quarter, down an annualized 14.7 per cent, the biggest drop since 2009.The economy also wasn\u2019t able to get a contribution from exporters who have helped lift growth over the past year.Exports recorded an annualized 0.2 per cent drop in the fourth quarter. Imports also declined, down 1.1 per cent.The biggest contributor to growth came from inventories \u2014 driven by machinery, food and wood producers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Enda Curran", "title": "Donald Trump just defused one of biggest risks hanging over global economy \u2014 for now", "description": "But the U.S.-China dispute is just one of a lengthening worry list that threatens to dent global growth", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-trade-truce-removes-a-cloud-over-global-economy-for-now?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/donald-trump-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 25, 2019 10:53 AM EST", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for increasing tariffs on Chinese goods defuses one of the biggest risks hanging over global trade, investment and sentiment.I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues.

Here\u2019s a look at why the bears won\u2019t be hibernating just yet.AutosThe U.S. president is considering whether to impose levies on imported vehicles on the basis they are a threat to national security. Such a move would hurt not just the U.S. economy, but big manufacturing ones including Germany, Japan and South Korea too. Higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory actions could jeopardize about US$500 billion of trade flows, accounting for 2.8 per cent of 2017 global imports, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Ltd. \nHalf of Canadian executives say old NAFTA better for our economy than USMCA\nExpect to pay thousands more for that new car if Trump pulls the trigger on auto tariffs\nOptimism fades as Canadian CEOs see lower growth at home and in key Chinese market\nChinaThe world\u2019s second-largest economy has been struggling to contain a slowdown even as policy makers ramp up their stimulus measures to stoke growth. Much will depend on how durable the trade truce is, given the breadth of concerns that the U.S. has regarding China\u2019s industrial and economic policies.\u201cI don\u2019t see the outlook for business investment globally improving markedly until we see more concrete plans for resolving the various issues between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore.FedWhile Federal Reserve policy makers see 2019 marking the end of their balance sheet run-off, it may not mean they are done raising interest rates. How Fed policy plays out will be crucial for emerging markets who have enjoyed a respite since Jerome Powell signalled a pause in the central bank\u2019s hiking cycle. Yet the dimming outlook for the world\u2019s biggest economy will drag the rest of the world, too, as fiscal stimulus fades and data shows signs of weakness.BrexitBritain is teetering on the brink of a cliff-edge departure from the European Union that lawmakers, economists and executives warn would spark economic chaos and drag on growth across key trading partners in Europe. Prime Minister Theresa May has set a new deadline of March 12 \u2014 just 17 days before Brexit day \u2014 for a final vote on her Brexit divorce agreement.Germany and ItalyEurope\u2019s biggest economy continues to send mixed signals amid persistent manufacturing weakness and soggy confidence levels. While improving consumption and investment hint at a pickup in coming months, there have been sharp downgrades to the growth outlook. Meanwhile, Italy sank into recession at the end of 2018 and is predicted to barely grow this year, leaving the economy to nurse huge debt, low growth and high unemployment.With assistance from Craig Torres and Jenny LeonardBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Christopher Condon and Craig Torres", "title": "The \u2018patient\u2019 Fed explained: end asset runoff this year and wait and see on rates", "description": "Minutes shed some light on the biggest policy reversal in years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-patient-fed-explained-end-asset-runoff-this-year-and-wait-and-see-on-rates", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/jerome-powell2.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 20, 2019 2:15 PM EST", "content": "Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s January meeting showed widespread agreement on ending the runoff of the central bank\u2019s balance sheet this year while officials expressed uncertainty over whether they would raise interest rates again in 2019.\u201cAlmost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset holdings later this year,\u201d according to the record of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s Jan. 29-30 gathering released Wednesday in Washington.\u201cSuch an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d the minutes said, referring to the rolloff of assets from the US$4 trillion balance sheet that began in late 2017. \nFed minutes out in less than an hour could shed light on the biggest policy reversal in years\nShedding additional light on the central bank\u2019s pivot away from projecting gradual interest-rate hikes, the minutes said that \u201cmany participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year.\u201dWhile several said rate hikes might be necessary \u201conly if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook,\u201d several others said that if the economy evolved as expected, higher rates would be appropriate later this year, according to the minutes.The minutes elaborated on the dovish message delivered three weeks ago when the FOMC said it will be \u201cpatient,\u201d signalling it had put interest-rate hikes on hold and was prepared to be more flexible on shrinking the balance sheet.Chairman Jerome Powell underscored the message in his Jan. 30 press conference by saying the Fed would be patient in deciding when and how to adjust policy in the face of a mounting set of risks, including slowing growth in China and Europe, Brexit, trade negotiations and the effects of the five-week U.S. government shutdown.

The current 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent target for the benchmark federal funds rate is at the bottom of their range of estimates for the neutral rate that neither speeds up nor slows the economy. Investors see rates staying on hold all year and lean toward a cut in 2020, according to pricing in interest-rate futures.The Fed\u2019s balance sheet policy also probably played a large role in the discussions. Officials issued a separate statement last month committing to an operational strategy of abundant bank reserves, which means a bigger balance sheet than would otherwise the case.They also said they would be flexible in shrinking their holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, depending on the economy. That was a shift from their previous guidance that they\u2019d be prepared to resume asset purchases if the economy weakened to the extent that it warranted a big cut in rates.But they were silent on when they\u2019d cease the rolloff, though a couple of officials have since said they\u2019re open to halting this year.\u201cWe are going to get a sense of the landing point\u201d for the balance sheet, said Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York, referring to a stopping point in the rundown of bank reserves. \u201cThe minutes are likely to send a signal that the end of the reduction in the Fed\u2019s Treasury portfolio could come as early as April.\u201dThe current pace of rolloffs, capped now at US$50 billion per month, was criticized by some Fed watchers as \u201cquantitative tightening,\u201d a play on the quantitative easing description given to the central bank\u2019s emergency asset purchases to protect the economy from the Great Recession.Another source of critical information from the minutes will be how officials discuss risks.

Lower production of petroleum and coal also drove a 0.5 per cent decline in manufacturing in November, the third drop in four months. Wholesaling fell by 1.1 per cent led by machinery and equipment, and construction fell for the sixth straight month to the lowest since the middle of 2017.Tumbling prices for Alberta oil late last year led the provincial government to impose production cuts that began in January.

Powell\u2019s press briefing on Wednesday inaugurates a new approach of briefing the media after every meeting of the FOMC \u2014 eight times a year \u2014 instead of every other meeting.

The committee said economic activity \u201chas been rising at a solid rate\u201d and job gains have been strong.

In a background document released in November, the ministry touted the economic benefits of adding 10,000 housing starts a year, an amount builders estimate would bring supply closer to demand.Supply side measures are seen as critical to restoring affordability in some of Canada\u2019s largest cities like Toronto, where prices have doubled since 2010. They would also ease pressure on policy makers to implement demand curbs that are seen as unnecessarily disruptive. \nCanada considers applying mortgage stress test rules to private lenders, sources say\nIn Canada\u2019s housing slowdown, Vancouver proves to be the weakest link\nPolicy decisions, interest rates slowed the real estate market, and they\u2019re needed for a rebound\n\u201cWe have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable cost,\u201d Clark said in a telephone interview, describing the affordability issue as a \u201ccrisis.\u201dThere is already growing concern that tighter mortgage regulations and other recent changes may have overshot, given last year\u2019s plunge in transactions. Demand measures are blunt instruments that apply to all markets regardless of affordability, and disproportionately affect low-income households and youth. Supply measures, in comparison, allow markets to continue growing, albeit at a more sustainable pace.We have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable costSteve Clark, Ontario housing minister \n \nToronto, along with Vancouver on the Pacific coast, has the lowest price elasticity of any urban market in Canada, meaning supply is the most out of sync with demand, according to a report last year from the federal housing agency.Developers agree. It takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association. The group estimates the GTA needs 50,000 new units a year to meet projected demand, but only about 40,000 are being built on average.\u201cThe issue in our view for the sharp rise in prices and the affordability issue fundamentally is the supply side not being able to adjust quickly enough to demand,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cSo a big part of the solution is on the supply side. Except you have to be more patient, because it takes a while.\u201d He said Clark\u2019s proposals \u201d are the right types of measures\u201d to ensure market imbalances get addressed more quickly.Infrastructure DelaysIt\u2019s unclear how Clark\u2019s reforms would affect one major contributor to supply bottlenecks: delays to infrastructure projects such as highways and sewer systems. The minister\u2019s proposed changes to the growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the swath of cities surrounding Toronto that\u2019s home to a quarter of Canada\u2019s population, deal more with speeding up development approvals and updating zoning and intensification targets, rather than streamlining infrastructure regulations that are seen as excessive and unpredictable.\n\nIt takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association.\n\nGraeme Roy/The Canadian Press\n\nThe previous government\u2019s focus on policy ideas just ended up \u201cgrinding things down to a halt,\u201d said Joe Vaccaro, chief executive officer at the Ontario Home Builders\u2019 Association. He\u2019s calling on Ford to \u201cclear the decks and get things moving again\u201d by making decisions on several stalled infrastructure projects.One of those is the Upper York Sewage Solutions Project, a $715 million (US$541 million) wastewater treatment system that was supposed to service 30,000 new homes in three towns in York Region, a municipality of about 1.1 million people north of Toronto.Stalled SewerMike Rabeau, director of capital planning in the region\u2019s environmental services division, began work on the environmental assessment in 2009. Five years and $25 million later, he submitted the 16,000 page report to Ontario\u2019s environment ministry, expecting a decision within eight months. More than four years later, he\u2019s still waiting.\u201cIf you can\u2019t flush a toilet, you can\u2019t build a home,\u201d Rabeau said by phone, adding the expected project completion date is now 2026 at the earliest.After early signals the project would be approved, environment ministry officials told Rabeau in late 2016 there were some outstanding issues concerning the duty to consult indigenous groups. Discussions between these groups, the provincial government and York Region are ongoing, according to a ministry spokesman.The delay is typical of a broader problem with building infrastructure in the GTA. \u201cWe\u2019re growing at a fairly rapid rate, and we\u2019ve got this conundrum that infrastructure has to go through quite a complex approval process,\u201d James McKellar, a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University, said in a phone interview. \u201cOur ability to bring infrastructure online in a timely way just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dMichael Fenn, a former Ontario deputy minister and a visiting fellow at the Ivey Business School\u2019s Lawrence National Centre, says housing should be given particular emphasis when it comes to infrastructure development. \u201cKeeping housing of a variety of types affordable and available is crucial to the economic success\u201d of the GTA and the country generally, he said.Clark acknowledges housing supply is a \u201cvery complex problem,\u201d and he stopped short of saying the environment minister should approve the York sewage project. He nevertheless understands the municipality\u2019s frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of something that, if you talk to the region, is taking way too long to get approved,\u201d he said.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Melinda Grenier.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s next rate move depends on data, says Stephen Poloz, but hike still on the table", "description": "Governor fends off criticism that recent tightening by some central banks was ill conceived", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canadas-poloz-says-future-rate-moves-are-data-dependent", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/stephen-poloz-davos.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 23, 2019 2:27 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he is keeping a close eye on developments in the nation\u2019s housing market, as well as global trade tensions and the impact of lower oil prices, as he gauges the timing of his next interest rate increase.In an interview with Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Poloz cited those three issues as key determinants of future policy, even as he reiterated his belief that borrowing costs are still likely to go higher.\u201cIt\u2019s data dependent,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cIt will depend on how the economy responds to the shocks we\u2019ve described.\u201d \nGloomy forecasts can\u2019t be going over well at the Ministry of Finance\nCanada\u2019s economy may soon endure something it hasn\u2019t faced in 68 years, according to BCA\nThe number of Canadians finding it tough to make ends meet is going up\nThe comments are in line with recent indications from the central bank that there\u2019s less urgency in its push toward higher interest rates as the economy grapples with slumping oil prices.

Mylonas says the surge in household debt combined with rising interest rates will push the Canadian economy into recession, even while the U.S. economy continues to grow.I think we're just on the precipice of embarking on a serious recessionJim Mylonas, global macro strategist at BCA Research \n \n\u201cI think we\u2019re just on the precipice of embarking on a serious recession,\u201d Mylonas said in an interview from Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.\u201dFor Mylonas, the irony is that surprisingly strong growth in the U.S. this year may push Canada over the edge. The expansion will force the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to raise rates, he said. The debt-laden Canadian consumer is ill-equipped to handle higher borrowing costs, unlike their U.S. counterparts who dialled back borrowing following the housing crash a decade ago. \n\u2018Everybody\u2019s in the dark\u2019: How the U.S. government shutdown is starting to hurt Canada\nThe number of Canadians finding it tough to make ends meet is going up\nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: The latest charts that matter most to the Bank of Canada\nFor Mylonas, the good news in the U.S. may be bad news for Canada.\u201cIf the U.S. economy is doing relatively well and the Fed is raising rates, it\u2019s very hard for the Bank of Canada to just sit on hold and not follow the Fed,\u201d Mylonas said. \u201cWe\u2019re now at the point where the Bank of Canada is going to be flirting with triggering the next recession if it hasn\u2019t already.\u201dIf Mylonas is right, it would be the first time since 1951 that Canada slipped into a recession without the U.S. also contracting.Canada\u2019s economic fortunes have always been tightly linked to its southern neighbour, the destination for about third quarters of its exports. The U.S. economy has reduced its imbalances after sparking the worst credit crisis in almost a century, led by a plunge in real estate. In Canada, which largely avoided the crash, corporations and consumers have been piling on debt ever since, Mylonas said.The debt to disposable income ratio in Canada rose to 175 per cent at the end of September, from 137 per cent in 2006, before the start of the financial crisis. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income was below 100 per cent as of September, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even at its recent peak, the U.S. ratio never topped 140 per cent.\u201cIn that 10-year period where the U.S. was on a diet, getting healthy, Canada was binge eating junk food, which is debt,\u201d Mylonas said, adding a medical analogy. \u201cEventually you go to the doctor and the doctor says, \u2018sorry, you gotta cut the junk food.\u2019 That\u2019s painful.\u201dCanada\u2019s housing market is already showing early signs of fatigue, with home sales declining last year to the lowest since 2012, according to Canadian Real Estate Association. The number of consumers seeking debt relief jumped 5.1 per cent in November from a year earlier, the Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy reported on Jan. 4.\u201cIf debt to disposable income is going to go from 180 to 130, then the recovery is going to look a lot more like the U.S. one, so shallow and long,\u201d said Mylonas.No RecessionTo be sure, most economists and the Bank of Canada aren\u2019t calling for a recession any time soon. The chances of a recession over the next 12 months is about 20 per cent, according to a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts released Jan. 11. Earlier this month, the central bank cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent, while raising its estimate for 2020 to 2.1 per cent. The chances of a U.S. recession is slightly higher, at 25 per cent, based on 49 estimates.Investors certainly aren\u2019t behaving as if a contraction is imminent. The Canadian dollar has gained the most among G-10 currencies this year, while the main equity gauge has jumped 7 per cent, the best start to a year since 1980.Traders aren\u2019t banking on an imminent hike by Poloz, who worked at BCA Research in the 1990s. Chances of an interest rate increase by May sit at about 30 per cent, according to trading on futures contracts.\u201cIf the Bank of Canada is not raising in line with the Fed, the reason it\u2019s not raising is probably rooted in bad news,\u201d such as weak economic growth, said Mylonas. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then my thesis for Canada will play out sooner than most think.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Kristine OwramBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Andrew Mayeda", "title": "IMF warns world economy set for weakest growth in three years", "description": "The risk of a sharper slowdown in global growth has increased", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-sees-weakest-global-growth-in-three-years-as-europe-slows?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/imf.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 21, 2019 10:12 AM EST", "content": "The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for the world economy, predicting it will grow at the weakest pace in three years in 2019 and warning fresh trade tensions would spell further trouble.In its second downgrade in three months, the lender blamed softening demand across Europe and recent palpitations in financial markets.

Soft consumer demand and weak factory production after the introduction of stricter emission standards for cars was behind the shift.The fund also cut its forecasts for Italy, citing weak demand and higher sovereign borrowing costs, and France, where the so-called Yellow-Vest protests have hurt the economy. The overall euro area will grow 1.6 per cent this year, 0.3 point below what it previously thought.While some of the issues in Europe may be temporary, the IMF noted that they came amid a backdrop of global trade policy uncertainty and concerns about China\u2019s outlook. President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping have given their officials until March 1 to reach a deal on a lasting truce after imposing tariffs on each other last year.\u201cThe possibility of tensions resurfacing in the Spring casts a shadow over global economic prospects,\u201d the IMF said. It predicts global trade volumes will rise 4 per cent this year and next, the same pace as in 2018 but below the 5.3 per cent of 2017.There was a big downgrade to Mexico\u2019s prospects \u2014 by up to half a percentage point \u2014 while the IMF said a slump in Venezuela may be deeper than previously anticipated.The 2019 U.S. forecast was unchanged at 2.5 per cent. But the IMF said growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy will cool to 1.8 per cent in 2020 as stimulus from tax cuts fades and the economy responds to higher Federal Reserve interest rates.As for China, the IMF still expects expansion of 6.2 per cent this year after 6.6 per cent in 2018, a slowing due to the trade war and the government\u2019s attempt to pare leverage.With assistance from Catherine Bosley.With file from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Top-performing hedge fund is shorting Canadian banks on all the usual suspects \u2014 and something even more worrying", "description": "Outside the financial sector, 80% of Canadian companies aren't generating enough cash to support their businesses, says Crescat", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/a-top-performing-hedge-fund-is-shorting-canada-banks-on-housing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/banks-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 18, 2019 9:21 AM EST", "content": "A small U.S. hedge fund that was a top performer last year is shorting Canadian banks.Crescat Capital sees the Canadian economy heading for recession as the housing market buckles.

Sales plunged 32 per cent in Vancouver last year and 16 per cent in Toronto amid rising interest rates, stricter mortgage rules and new taxes.\u201cChina is in the process of reversing its key role as a driver of global economic growth,\u201d the 29-year-old Costa said. \u201cCountries like Canada and Australia, and their respective housing markets, are the economies most vulnerable in this scenario.\u201dMeanwhile, Crescat calculates that about 80 per cent of Canadian non-financial stocks have been cash-flow negative in the past 12 months, which he measures as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.That may be inflated by the the large numbers of \u201czombie\u201d companies on Canadian stock exchanges, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines as those 10 years and older and whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to cover interest payments on their debts. In a September study, Deloitte found 16 per cent of public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its sister Venture Exchange are considered zombies, compared with 10 per cent globally.Cash flow in the energy sector may have been hammered by a slump in crude prices in the past year.But Costa said even if he excludes energy and materials stocks, 70 per cent of Canadian stocks have still lost money on a free cash-flow basis. If you consider only non-financial stocks with a market value of more than $100 million, the share is still more than 50 per cent, he said.\u201cHow is it sustainable for companies that generate no cash to continue to employ people?\u201d Costa said. \u201cMany of these troubled companies would be bankrupt under tighter monetary conditions.\u201dPrevious ShortsThe country\u2019s biggest lenders could face troubles on both the housing and corporate fronts, according to Costa.At their peak last year, the six largest banks, traded at an average of 1.9 times book value, a similar valuation to U.S. banks prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, according to Costa. He expects that to drop to 0.7 times book value or so, where U.S. banks were trading post-financial crisis.Other investors have recommended shorting Canadian financials on a looming housing correction in the past, including Steve Eisman, who predicted the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse.And Canadians bank stocks have largely defied naysayers as the country\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered near records lows amid steady growth \u2014 until recently. The S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks Index slumped 11 per cent last year amid market global volatility, the biggest decline since 2008.\u201cMost of these banks are off their highs and have just started to break down,\u201d Costa said.With assistance from Doug Alexander and Brandon Kochkodin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert", "title": "'Uncharted waters': Wall Street grows antsy as shutdown threat to stocks intensifies", "description": "Though U.S. equities have historically done well after shutdowns, this one 'has lasted an unprecedented amount of time with no end in sight'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/uncharted-waters-wall-street-grows-antsy-as-shutdown-threat-to-stocks-intensifies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/afinancial_markets_wall_street.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 17, 2019 4:03 PM EST", "content": "A growing group of analysts and investors is warning that the U.S. government shutdown could soon hurt stocks.Already confronting an increase in volatility, an uncertain outlook for interest rates and a trade war that threatens to damp global growth, traders now have to factor in the economic effects of the partial closure, in its record 27th day.\u201cThe impact can become meaningful as the shutdown continues,\u201d said Max Gokhman, the head of asset allocation for Pacific Life Fund Advisors. \u201cThe longer we go, the more we delve into uncharted waters and, as we all know, this market hates uncertainty.\u201d \nThe U.S. government shutdown: What exactly happens in a situation like this?\n\u2018If there\u2019s a dip buy it:\u2019 Number of U.S. government shutdowns in the past 42 years \u2014 18.

But pessimists fear the impact could become more widespread as federal workers miss out on paycheques, government bureaucracy slows and the effects trickle out to the broader economy. Terry Haines, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of political analysis, cited research in a note Thursday that found the shutdown could reduce quarterly economic growth anywhere from 0.5 to 2 percentage points.For all the hand-wringing, the overall market impact has been limited so far. The S&P 500 Index has gained 8.6 per cent since the day before the closure. Furthermore, U.S. equities have historically fared well after shutdowns, demonstrating the negative economic impact isn\u2019t usually enough to derail a market rally on its own, according to an LPL Financial Research note Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize, however, that the current shutdown has lasted for an unprecedented amount of time with no end in sight,\u201d the note said.The longer we go, the more we delve into uncharted waters and, as we all know, this market hates uncertainty.Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation, Pacific Life Fund Advisors \n \nAnalysts are bumping up their estimates for just how long this shutdown will last.

Of course, if economies weather the latest challenges, policymakers may need to rethink anew. \nPhilip Cross: Central bankers can blame themselves for undermining their political \u2018independence\u2019\nIn the Age of Trump, central banks are only one populist uprising away from losing cherished independence\n\u2018I\u2019m not thrilled\u2019: Trump blasts Fed\u2019s rate hikes, trespassing on central bank\u2019s independence\nBloomberg Economics\u2019 produces a quarterly review of top central banks; here are several. We outline the issues they face in 2019 and how they might respond.U.S. Federal ReserveCurrent federal funds rate (upper bound): 2.5 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: 3 per cent.The Fed spooked markets at the end of 2018 with a projection for two rate hikes in 2019, based on a more optimistic outlook for the economy than investors held. Policymakers pointed to forecasts of continued strong growth and jobs gains, while investors fretted over slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war. Contributing to the unease, President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Fed Chairman Powell out of frustration over the Fed\u2019s gradual tightening campaign.Powell has since dialled back his message, assuring markets he would be flexible and patient. Many Fed watchers now believe U.S. policymakers are unlikely to raise rates before June unless data surprises to the upside.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cThe Fed\u2019s communication campaign preaching policy patience calmed the markets down. Yet, just a little patience will not alter the Fed\u2019s hiking bias. The real fed funds rate barely crossed into positive territory in the fourth quarter after sitting in the red since the Great Recession. There is ample room for the Fed to continue removing policy accommodation, especially if the pace of core inflation picks up above the central bank\u2019s target. We expect two rate hikes in 2019.\u201d \u2014 Yelena Shulyatyeva\n\nBank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.\n\nAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press files\n\nBank of CanadaCurrent overnight lending rate: 1.75 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: 2.25 per cent.The Bank of Canada is sticking to its view that more interest rates increases will be needed on top of five hikes over the past two years, but there seems to be a lot less urgency than there was a few months ago.Canada\u2019s\u00a0oil-producing regions were hit hard by last year\u2019s slide in crude prices, leading the BOC to sharply mark down the near-term outlook for the economy at its latest rate decision. It also softened its tone on future moves, saying they would only happen \u201cover time.\u201d\u00a0Still, the soft patch in growth is seen as a temporary one, and policymakers expect the economy to rebound later this year \u2013 putting them back on the hiking path.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cIncreasing global risks and slumping energy prices should keep the Bank of Canada on hold for all of 2019. The housing market and consumer spending may be moderating more than expected and wage growth has softened recently. This reduces the urgency for the central bank to stay ahead of inflationary pressures resulting from strong economic growth and a historically tight labour market last year.\u201d \u2014 Tim MahedyThe risks are skewed toward a delayed liftoffBloomberg economist Jamie Murray \n \nEuropean Central BankCurrent deposit\u00a0rate: -0.4 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: -0.25 per cent.The euro area reached a turning point for monetary stimulus when the ECB capped quantitative easing at the end of 2018. A slowing economy and sub-target inflation means the central bank will stay supportive. It intends to keep interest rates at record lows through this summer.Economists predict a hike late in the year, though investors don\u2019t expect one until 2020. Much will depend on how the 19-nation economy copes with risks from protectionism and volatility in emerging and financial markets.\u00a0Mario Draghi\u2019s presidential term expires in October, meaning he may leave without raising rates. Jockeying for his job has already started, with a decision by governments likely after European Parliament elections in May.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cInflation has plunged on oil costs, posing a risk to pay settlements, and the economy has slowed. These developments call for policy caution. Assuming growth stabilizes around trend and President Draghi passes the baton to a continuity candidate, we expect a hike to the deposit rate in December 2020. Still, the risks are skewed toward a delayed liftoff.\u201d \u2014 Jamie MurrayBank of EnglandCurrent bank rate: 0.75 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: 1 per centMark Carney\u00a0is starting his final full year as Bank of England governor before he leaves in January 2020. He can expect the central bank\u2019s outlook to continue to be dominated by Brexit, especially after the U.K. formally leaves the EU on March 29.As the deadline nears and the chance of a chaotic exit rises, investors have bet there\u2019ll be no rate increases in the next 12 months, though economists foresee at least one squeezed in.\u00a0Carney has warned that a no-deal Brexit could drive up inflation that requires higher borrowing costs. If the government can get a deal signed in time, the market outlook could quickly be rewritten.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cBrexit uncertainty is at fever pitch. The Bank of England won\u2019t lift rates in that environment. We remain of the view that Brexit will be orderly. If it is, the central bank is likely to waste no time lifting rates \u2014 the first hike is likely in May and another should follow in November.\u201d \u2014 Dan Hanson\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan\n\nYOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBank of JapanCurrent policy-rate balance: -0.1 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: -0.1 per cent.The BOJ faces a huge test in 2019 as inflation falls further below its two per cent target, exposing the limits of its massive monetary stimulus program. Some economists see a risk of the core consumer price index falling below zero as cheaper energy and mobile-phone charges undermine BOJ policies. January\u2019s flash crash in the currency market, which brought a sharp and unwelcome strengthening in the yen, underscores how much is beyond the central bank\u2019s control.While stimulus continues to weigh down profits at commercial banks and distorts the bond market, a majority of BOJ watchers expect Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to keep his current yield-curve settings in place at least through the end of 2019, with the short-term rate locked at minus 0.1 per cent and the 10-year bond yield target at around zero\u00a0per cent. Bond purchases are likely to be pared back further, while the BOJ\u2019s presence in the market for exchange-traded funds will depend on whether stocks need propping up. On balance the BOJ is expected to drift further from its peers as they chart a return to pre-crisis policies. The looming hike to the\u00a0sales tax may also complicate matters.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cThe BOJ will need to maintain easing in 2019, with inflation weak and growth under pressure. The threat of renewed yen strength as U.S. Treasury yields retreat will also keep it on guard. Sustaining stimulus may grow more challenging. Financial imbalances are increasing \u2013\u00a0one reason to pull back. What\u2019s more, lower U.S. yields are putting downward pressure on JGB yields \u2013\u00a0and the further they fall, the less the need for BOJ purchases. A challenge ahead for Governor Kuroda will be to find a balance between two camps on the policy board \u2013\u00a0the reflationists, and those more concerned about the risks from the BOJ\u2019s policy.\u201d \u2014 Yuki MasujimaBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Interest rates cast pall on Canadian home sales, with December losses capping worst year since 2012", "description": "Nationwide, sales totalled 458,442 for the year, a drop of 11 per cent which was the biggest since 2008, the Canadian Real Estate Association said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/home-sales-down-in-december-to-cap-weakest-annual-sales-since-2012-crea?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/for-sale-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 15, 2019 11:28 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s home sales skidded to the lowest level since 2012 last year after dropping for four straight months through December, as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market.Nationwide, sales totalled 458,442 for the year, a drop of 11 per cent which was the biggest since 2008, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday from Ottawa.

Technology and wholesale company managers more tied to exports showed the most investment confidence while those associated more with consumer spending saw declines, the BDC report said.Alberta showed the least optimism among Canadian regions with 35 per cent of managers in the oil-dependent western province confident about the economy.

Recent weakness in oil prices, meanwhile, could have spillover effects on the real estate markets in energy producing regions.The central bank revised down its expectations for the sector, which it now expects to shrink in 2019 after previously forecasting a small gain.Softness in interest-rate sensitive segments of the economy goes beyond housing. Spending on durable goods also dragged on third quarter growth. Auto sales fell on an annual basis for the first time since 2009, and analysts expect another retreat in 2019.

Markets are pricing in zero chance of an increase. The Bank of Canada will also release its quarterly economic forecasts Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Governor Stephen Poloz.What\u2019s certain is the Bank of Canada will need to revise down its projections for growth, at least for this year, thanks to weaker oil prices and transport bottlenecks that have prompted the Alberta government to implement temporary production cuts. In its October forecasts, the central bank estimated growth of 2.1 per cent in 2019 \u2014 which now looks on the high side.Economists see Canadian growth sliding closer to 1 per cent on an annualized basis for a few months, before bouncing back once Alberta\u2019s output cuts are lifted. After that, the pace of the expansion should return to near its recent trend of 2 per cent for the rest of the year.\u2018Solid Footing\u2019Recent data have been promising. Canada\u2019s economy continues to produce enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate at historic lows, and businesses remain upbeat about investment and hiring plans. Even oil prices have shown a bit of a comeback in recent days, giving a lift to the Canadian dollar to start the year.\u201cWe have entered a slow patch, but the economy is on solid footing,\u201d said Josh Nye, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, which is expecting the central bank to increase rates twice this year.Still, there\u2019s enough concern to curb the central bank\u2019s enthusiasm for higher rates and even in the best case Poloz is probably already near the end of his hiking cycle. For one, signs have begun to emerge that higher interest rates are slowing consumption and the housing market. There is also new evidence suggesting the economy had more slack in recent years than previously thought.Plus, with markets also pricing in a rate pause from the Federal Reserve, the Canadian central bank may be reluctant to press ahead with higher interest rates for fear of driving up the country\u2019s currency.But Poloz isn\u2019t sounding like someone who has given up on rate increases. The central banker told CTV News last month that interest rates should eventually move toward a neutral range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 per cent given the economy is operating near capacity, unemployment is at four-decade lows, and inflation is at the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target.\u201cGetting there, it\u2019s a journey and we expect over time to get there.

That would be the biggest increase since 2016, when stocks gained 18 per cent.Ten stocks for 2019: What the pros are picking to outperform this yearIt could be worse: An optimist\u2019s guide to investing in 2019Outlook 2019: Here\u2019s where the experts think the TSX will end up one year from now\u201cOur expectation is that 2019 is going to be a better year than 2018 based on the fact that pessimism right now is at extreme levels,\u201d Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital Corp., said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen everybody\u2019s on the same trade, when everybody\u2019s negative, we think this is a good opportunity to go in the other direction.\u201dBangsund expects the S&P/TSX to end 2019 at 16,800 amid strong earnings, and recommends investors overweight beaten-down energy stocks and financials. This time last year, she predicted the market would finish 2018 at 16,900 and later raised that target to 17,300.Instead, the Canadian benchmark fell 12 per cent in 2018 to 14,323, with most of that drop coming in the final quarter of the year amid a decline in global stocks. Concerns about a global trade war, rising interest rates, a housing slowdown and plunging oil prices all weighed on the Canadian market.Crude RealityEnergy stocks were the worst performers, posting a decline of 21 per cent, followed by consumer discretionary, down 18 per cent. Even pot stocks, which were a bastion of optimism for Canadian investors as the country legalized recreational marijuana, ended the year in negative territory.It\u2019s been a frustrating experience for investors and strategists alike. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, had a strong track record of calling the market before 2018. His forecast for the S&P/TSX in 2017 was only 200 points below the final closing number while his 2016 forecast came within 12 points of the close. His estimate of 17,600 for 2018 was off by a wide margin, however. Belski sees 2019 ending at 18,000, 26 per cent above current levels.Bear Facts\u201cFundamentals can, will, and should be rewarded at some point,\u201d he wrote in a 2019 market outlook published in November. \u201cIn our view, the best time to be contrarian is when the analysis is telling you something exceedingly different from what sentiment and rhetoric is exhibiting.\u201d He added that \u201cCanada is rich with solid companies\u201d and investors should take a bottom-up approach to stock picking, paying particular attention to energy and financials.Not everyone is optimistic there will be a big rebound. Sadiq Adatia, who manages about $23 billion (US$17 billion) as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, sees the S&P/TSX closing out the year at 15,000, just 4.7 per cent above current levels. Adatia was the most bearish forecaster last year as well, initially predicting the benchmark would end the year at 15,200 and later raising that to a range of 16,000 to 16,250.\u201cWhat has me worried is that consumers are losing steam\u201d amid rising interest rates, Adatia said in a phone interview, adding that he expects the Bank of Canada will hike rates once in 2019 but would prefer if it didn\u2019t hike at all.\u201cRates will impact how consumers spend going forward, how they deal with their debt levels and what happens in the housing market as well,\u201d he said. However, Canada may not fare as badly as some of its global counterparts.\u201cWe think if you hold a portion of your portfolio in Canada, it\u2019s because of risk management,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get a major continuation of the selloff and we get into bear market territory, Canada might actually hold up relatively well because it hasn\u2019t participated fully on the upside of this bull market.\u201dHere are the strategists\u2019 calls for 2019, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,000Edward Jones: 15,600Russell Investments: 16,000Scotia Capital: 16,500Fiera Capital: 16,800Manulife: 17,250BMO Capital Markets: 18,000Laurentian Bank: 18,000Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "U.S. government shutdown likely to stretch into 2019 amid border wall standoff", "description": "Trump threatens to close the U.S.-Mexico border until standoff is resolved", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-government-shutdown-likely-to-stretch-into-2019-amid-border-wall-standoff?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/shutdown.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 28, 2018 9:18 AM EST", "content": "Donald Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday as a week-long partial government shutdown appeared likely to stretch into 2019 because of an impasse over funding for the president\u2019s proposed border wall.\u201cWe will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.Trump\u2019s latest ultimatum comes a day after House Republicans said they didn\u2019t plan any votes this week and as the president sought to shift blame to Democrats for a stalemate over funding for a wall that a majority of Americans don\u2019t support, according to polls. It echoed a threat he made in November, when he said he\u2019d close the border \u201cfor a long time\u201d if Mexican authorities couldn\u2019t quell attempts by large groups of migrants to cross into the U.S.U.S. government out past the weekend with no House vote FridayU.S. government shutdown will have cost America $1.2 billion by tomorrowU.S. government shutdown enters third day with no urgency to reopen after everyone leaves townThere was no sign of any progress toward a plan to fund nine government departments that closed after funding ran out Dec. 21. The Senate and House held brief sessions Thursday afternoon, and neither chamber took any votes.Details of any potential closing of the 1,954-mile (3,145 kilometre) border with Mexico aren\u2019t yet clear. Mexico is America\u2019s third-largest trading partner in goods with US$557.6 billion in two-way trade during 2017, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trade in services accounted for another US$58 billion.Trump said in another tweet that the U.S. \u201clooses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a \u2018profit making operation.\u201d\u2019\n\nA sign announcing the closure of the National Archives due to a partial government shutdown is displayed in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Dec. 27, 2018.\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nThe U.S. data report a US$17.1 billion goods deficit with Canada in 2017, and a US$71 billion goods deficit with Mexico. Both countries, however, reported substantially larger U.S. goods surpluses in the same relationship. In 2017, Canada reported a US$97.7 billion surplus, and Mexico a US$132.4 billion surplus.Senators have been told they\u2019ll vote only once there\u2019s a deal backed by Democrats and by Trump, who is demanding US$5 billion for a wall at the southern border, his central campaign promise. Democrats call such spending wasteful and ineffective. The standoff produced a fresh round of finger-pointing late on Thursday afternoon.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement outlining Trump\u2019s demands that didn\u2019t include the word \u201cwall.\u201d She said later there was no significance to that omission.\u201cThe president has made clear that any bill to fund the government must adequately fund border security to stop the flow of illegal drugs, criminals, MS-13 gang members, child smugglers and human traffickers into our communities\u2014 and protect the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county\u2019s safety and security.\u201dThe White House is flexible on the composition of the border wall Trump has demanded, one official said, noting that the president has used a variety of terms to describe it in recent days including slats, fence and barrier.Sanders complained that Democrats haven\u2019t responded to a compromise offer conveyed by Vice President Mike Pence late last week, and that the opposition party \u201cdecided to go home\u201d while Trump stayed in Washington over Christmas to negotiate.Underscoring the pressure Trump is facing from some in his own party, Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas said Friday on Fox News that the shutdown should continue \u201cuntil Hell freezes over\u201d if needed to secure funding for the barrier.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected the offer from Pence, said his spokesman, Justin Goodman. The New York Democrat told Pence that Democrats won\u2019t consider any offer without a public endorsement by Trump because the president has changed his position so often, said Goodman, who added the two sides remain far apart.Three OptionsHouse Democrats answered in kind.\u201cDemocrats have offered Republicans three options to reopen government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security \u2014 but not the president\u2019s immoral, ineffective and expensive wall,\u201d said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, who\u2019s expected to become speaker of the House when Democrats take control of the chamber next week.Earlier in the day, Trump said that most federal employees who aren\u2019t receiving paychecks because of the government shutdown are Democrats.\u201cDo the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday morning, prompting outrage from some in Congress. The president provided no evidence to support the claim, which he made only days after characterizing federal employees as supporters of the wall and the partial shutdown.Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the chamber\u2019s intelligence committee, called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding on Twitter on Thursday that \u201cfederal employees don\u2019t go to work wearing red or blue jerseys.\u201dThe president, who returned to Washington early Thursday from a trip to visit U.S. troops in Iraq, tweeted about the standoff later, accusing Democrats of \u201cOBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall.\u201dVolatility returned to U.S. markets, with stocks bouncing back from the lows of the day after flirting with a bear market amid higher interest rates and the political turmoil in Washington. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average turned green in a late jump after trading negative for most of the day.Federal workers will begin to lose money starting with Friday\u2019s paycheque, according to National Treasury Employees Union President Tony Reardon. That cheque will reflect work through last Saturday, the day the shutdown began. That means Saturday shift workers, including many in Customs and Border Protection, won\u2019t see pay for that day in their cheques.All workers in the nine departments and dozens of agencies with funding lapses will miss their Jan. 11 paycheck if the shutdown continues, he said in an interview.\u201cI\u2019ve had members come to me saying they are returning holiday and Christmas presents they bought because they are worried about paying rent,\u201d Reardon said. He said he was disappointed that Congress wasn\u2019t in session working to reopen the government.During the shutdown, Reardon said, \u201cparks are being left open to illegal activity and vandalism, industrial complaints are going unanswered, the SEC isn\u2019t investigating securities fraud and the IRS will have trouble implementing the largest legislative overhaul of the tax code in a generation.\u201dThe Office of Personnel Management released form letters that furloughed workers could use to negotiate with creditors.GOP Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, who presided over his chamber\u2019s brief session, said regarding government workers, \u201cWe respect them and we hope we can get this solved as quickly as possible.\u201dIn addition, thousands of U.S. home sales are being held up because the shutdown has halted the issuance of new flood insurance policies. The Federal Emergency Management Administration stopped issuing new policies under the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA, which oversees disaster response, is part of the Department of Homeland Security.House members have been told they\u2019ll get 24 hours\u2019 notice if they need to travel back to Washington to vote on any deal.Jim McGovern, the incoming Democratic chairman of the House Rules Committee, said if there isn\u2019t a resolution by Jan. 3 when the new Congress is sworn in, the Democratic majority will vote on a stopgap spending measure to reopen the government agencies. He said Democratic leaders are discussing whether funding would last until Feb. 8 like the Senate-passed bill, for the full fiscal year through September, or until some other date.Republicans say they\u2019re still waiting for Democrats to respond to an offer from the White House last Saturday. The administration said it would accept US$2.1 billion for border barriers along with a US$400 million flexible fund for immigration priorities. Democrats dismissed the offer as hollow because Trump has said publicly he still wants US$5 billion for a wall.New Year\u2019s RecessCongress is scheduled to return on Monday although no votes are scheduled, and lawmakers will be in recess on New Year\u2019s Day. The current Congress ends at noon Jan. 3, when new members elected in November\u2019s midterm election will take their oaths.\u201cI don\u2019t see a scenario where the government opens back up before a new Congress is sworn in,\u201d Representative Ryan Costello, a retiring Pennsylvania Republican, said on MSNBC Thursday. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows sought to blame the shutdown on Schumer in a tweet Thursday urging the New York Democrat to accept US$5 billion for a wall.\u201cThe House passed it. The WH wants it. The Senate majority wants it.

Offices of congressional leaders who are responsible for negotiating with the president are shuttered as Trump remains at the White House after cancelling a trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Previous government closures have put Washington in crisis mode with round-the-clock talks, strategy sessions and public posturing. Not so, this time. The next possibility for votes in the House and Senate is on Dec. 27, but Democrats have indicated the two sides are far from a deal. If there\u2019s no agreement, many lawmakers won\u2019t return until the new session of Congress starts on Jan. 3, when Democrats take control of the House.U.S. government shutdown continues with no indication Trump, Democrats near dealFed raises interest rates, turns more cautious on outlook for 2019 hikesTrump\u2019s metal tariffs \u2018contradict\u2019 new NAFTA and will have to go, says Chrystia FreelandDemocrats said Monday they\u2019re having trouble negotiating with the Trump administration. \u201cDifferent people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in joint statement.The president has been attacking Democrats over the wall on Twitter, and continued on Monday. \u201cI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\u201d Trump wrote.No AgreementOn Sunday, the White House signalled there was no end in sight to the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,\u201d White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201dPelosi on Saturday made a similar prediction in a letter to Democrats. Pelosi, likely to become House speaker, said that if the shutdown continues when Democrats take control of the chamber they would quickly pass legislation to reopen shuttered agencies.In a sign the president\u2019s strategy has sparked serious unease among Republicans, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas \u2014 the only senator at the Capitol Monday \u2014 suggested a compromise to reopen the government but without wall funding.\u201cThe border needs more money, just to take care of people that seek asylum and what\u2019s going on down there,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSo, if we can do that, without the wall, I think that\u2019s a solution. But a lot of people are dug in on this issue.\u201dTrump was set to hold a meeting on border security Monday afternoon with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other DHS officials, according to the White House.Unlike the other two shutdowns this year, the one that started Saturday includes only part of the federal government \u2014 nine of 15 departments, representing about a quarter of the US$1.24 trillion in government discretionary spending for fiscal year 2019. Many of the biggest government functions, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, have already been fully funded through September.The partial shutdown \u2014 along with Trump declaring Monday, Christmas Eve, a federal holiday \u2014 may be contributing to a less-than-urgent approach to the negotiations.\u201cWhen everybody leaves town, it takes the pressure off for a deal,\u201d said New York Representative Lee Zeldin, a Republican. \u201cThe American people expect both sides to figure it out, to come to a compromise.\u201dLeft TownAsked why Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin left Washington, spokesman Mike Ricci said by email the House will pass a plan that can get through the Senate and that the president agrees to sign. \u201cThe White House is engaged in talks with Senate Democrats, and when the Senate acts, the House will be prepared to follow,\u201d Ricci said.The fight between Democrats and Trump is over $5 billion for wall construction on the U.S.-Mexico border, a relatively small amount by Washington standards. But both sides have staked out firm positions. Trump campaigned on building a wall, which he\u2019d originally said Mexico would pay for. Democrats say a wall is wasteful and ineffective.The outcome of the shutdown will set the stage for the next two years of divided government in Washington, with Republicans in control of the White House and Senate and Democrats running the House.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Trump and the Democrats need to resolve the dispute over boarder funding before he brings up legislation to end the shutdown in the Senate. Even though Republicans hold a majority in the chamber, they need Democratic votes to get to the 60-vote threshold to pass funding measures.Not CloseThe two sides don\u2019t appear close to a deal, even though their offers differ by tiny fraction of the overall federal budget.There was a flurry of activity Friday night and Saturday, including a proposal to end the impasse from the White House to Schumer of New York. The Saturday offer was US$2.5 billion for border security, including new fencing and US$400 million for Trump immigration priorities, according to a Democratic aide. A spokesman for Schumer said after the offer that the two sides were far apart in negotiations.Schumer has said Trump must abandon his border wall to reopen the government, while Trump has insisted he get more than the US$1.6 billion for border upgrades that Senate Democrats previously backed. The negotiations have centered on border security funding amounts and how that spending would be restricted.Even if House Democrats pass a bill in January with no wall funding, and the Senate goes along, there\u2019s no indication Trump would sign it or that Republicans would override the president to reopen the government \u2014 which requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber. Define \u2018The Wall\u2019Any ultimate deal will likely depend on what defines \u201cthe wall.\u201d The White House has opened the door for a compromise by talking about \u201csteel slats\u201d rather than the concrete wall Trump touted in the past. Trump tweeted out a drawing of a barrier made with vertical spike-tipped slats last week.Mulvaney said on Fox News that the drawing in Trump\u2019s tweet is what the administration wants.\u201cIn the Democrats\u2019 mind, that is not a wall. So they have offered us US$1.3 billion to build the barrier that we want \u2014 but then they go on TV and say there\u2019s no money for the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already told the Democrats we want to build what the president tweeted out. It doesn\u2019t have to be a 30-foot tall concrete\u201d barrier, he said.Some Democrats still aren\u2019t on board.\u201cNo steel slats,\u201d tweeted Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Vildana Hajric", "title": "U.S. stocks suffer worst week since 2011 amid White House chaos", "description": "Every sector lost ground and heavy selling in technology shares drove the Nasdaq indexes into a bear market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-have-worst-week-since-2011-amid-d-c-chaos-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/traders.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 21, 2018 4:13 PM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks sank to a 19-month low to close out their worst week since August 2011, with every sector losing ground and heavy selling in technology shares driving the Nasdaq indexes into a bear market.

Fed officials also maintained a generally upbeat view of the economy even as they trimmed their own projections for future rate increases. Observers offered several possible explanations for the risk-off response in markets.Markets Snubbed?Some thought that the written statement from the Federal Open Market Committee didn\u2019t sufficiently address mounting market strains, which have seen U.S. stocks hammered and bond yields tumble in recent weeks.Fed raises interest rates, turns more cautious on outlook for 2019 hikesU.S. Federal Reserve hikes rate: Read the official statementPace of Bank of Canada rate hikes could be interrupted, Stephen Poloz says\u201cThe Fed is indicating that it\u2019s listening to the markets, it has respect for the markets, but it\u2019s not going to be ruled by the markets,\u201d said Greg Staples, co-head of Americas fixed income at DWS, following the decision.The press conference from Chairman Jerome Powell also did little to ease market disappointment. He noted that the FOMC \u201ctook on board the tightening in financial conditions,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t focusing on any single market. What matters for the economy is broad changes that are sustained, the chairman said.The reality is the market just doesn't agree with their growth outlook \n \nConcern Over ProjectionsAnother concern, according to Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s Gene Tannuzzo, is that the Fed hasn\u2019t sufficiently downgraded its rate projections and is underestimating the growth challenges ahead.\u201cThe reality is the market just doesn\u2019t agree with their growth outlook,\u201d Tannuzzo said in an interview following Powell\u2019s press conference. He pointed out that the Fed\u2019s summary of rate projections \u2014 known as the dot plot \u2014 is becoming a liability for the FOMC. This is because market participants continue to fixate on it as a prediction rather than as a scenario that\u2019s subject to incoming data and the Fed\u2019s changing economic outlook.Balance-Sheet UnwindA third concern is a general unease about the Fed\u2019s unwind of quantitative easing, which some feel is a genuine threat to market liquidity. Guggenheim\u2019s Scott Minerd attributed the stock market\u2019s swoon to Powell\u2019s apparent inflexibility on shrinking the balance sheet.When Powell spoke about how he wouldn\u2019t look at adjusting the pace of balance-sheet reduction \u201cthe market took a decided crack down,\u201d according to Minerd.Despite its more technical nature relative to the adjustment of the fed funds rate, the balance sheet has loomed larger among investors\u2019 concerns of late. Ben Jeffery of Bank of Montreal attributed this increased focus in part to recent tweeting by U.S. President Donald Trump.\u201cThe fact Trump mentioned the balance sheet earlier this week has brought it top of mind for a lot of people,\u201d Jeffery said.With assistance from Alexandra HarrisBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Higher interest rates pushing more Canadians to seek debt relief as business booms for insolvency trustees", "description": "Record debt burdens, rising borrowing costs and, in some cases, bigger payday loans are driving many Canadians to insolvency", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/debt/business-booms-for-insolvency-trustees-amid-higher-canada-rates", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/debt-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 20, 2018 9:40 AM EST", "content": "People who make a living guiding others through bankruptcy in Canada say they\u2019ve never been busier.Record debt burdens, rising borrowing costs and, in some cases, bigger payday loans are driving many Canadians to seek relief, according to several licensed insolvency trustees who spoke to Bloomberg.

The latest official data from the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies showed the rate of consumer insolvencies rose 9.4 per cent in October on an annual basis, the most since 2016.Insolvency data can be volatile, but it appears Canadian consumers are at an inflection point. \u201cThe tide has turned, and the water\u2019s starting to rise,\u201d Ted Michalos, a licensed insolvency trustee at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cNow it\u2019s just a question of how quickly does it rise.\u201dConsumer PinchThe effects of higher borrowing costs are beginning to be felt broadly. Vehicle sales, among the sectors most sensitive to rising rates, fell the most since 2009, while growth in residential mortgages decelerated to the slowest pace since 1982, worrying signs for an economy so reliant on consumption.The tide has turned, and the water's starting to rise. Now it's just a question of how quickly does it riseTed Michalos, licensed insolvency trustee \n \nIn addition, liabilities are eating up a bigger share of disposable income. Canada\u2019s debt service ratio climbed to 14.51 on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, the highest since 2008, the federal statistics agency reported last week.Hoyes, Michalos \u2014 which usually accounts for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of insolvency filings in Ontario \u2014 just had its busiest November since opening in 1999. The insolvency trustee and debt relief agency received 1,000 new inquiries, compared with 650 in November 2017, and initiated 384 new filings, surpassing the previous high of 350 in November 2009. Through the first 10 days of December, Michalos said the firm\u2019s numbers are up 57 per cent from a year earlier.Payday LoansLower gasoline prices aren\u2019t fully offsetting higher mortgage costs, and \u201cthere is very little room in many Canadians\u2019 budgets to absorb these increased costs,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s also seeing more clients with so-called installment loans, basically large, high-interest payday loans that can be paid off over a longer period.Mantin, whose Vancouver-based firm recorded it\u2019s biggest year-over-year increase in filings in November since he joined eight years ago, also cited an increase in large payday loans among his clients. He said previously it would have been typical to see payday loans of $500 (US$373) or $1,000. Now he sometimes sees \u201cinstallment loans\u201d of $15,000.Higher rates are hitting at a time when consumers are already struggling to cope with the recent housing boom. Mantin says the majority of clients in the firm\u2019s downtown Vancouver office pay 50 per cent or more of their income in rent, \u201cand you can only do that for so long,\u201d he said. Other clients are young families who overextended themselves at the peak of the boom, often tapping home equity to make renovations, and now can\u2019t sell.Grant Bazian, president at MNP Ltd., said November was the agency\u2019s busiest ever, with year-over-year growth in filings of about 12 per cent.

So I do think that gives the committee the ability to be patient in moving forward.\u201dPowell and his colleagues said \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a strong rate,\u2019\u2019 according to a statement following the two-day meeting in Washington. While officials said risks to their outlook \u201care roughly balanced,\u201d they flagged threats from a softening world economy.The Federal Open Market Committee \u201cwill continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook,\u201d the statement said. The 10-0 decision lifted the federal funds rate target to a range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.The quarter-point hike came after Trump assailed the Fed on Twitter for two straight days, urging it to hold rates steady in the most public assault on its political independence in decades. Investors are also fretting over the economy, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly in recent weeks.Answering questions during the press conference, Powell said political considerations play no role in Fed policy making. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our jobs the way we\u2019ve always done them,\u201d he said when asked about White House pressure. The Fed will do its analysis and \u201cnothing will cause us to deviate from that,\u201d he added.Officials also altered key language in their statement, saying the FOMC \u201cjudges that some further gradual increases\u201d in rates will likely be needed, a shift from previous language saying the FOMC \u201cexpects that further gradual increases\u201d would be required. In addition, the median estimate among policy makers for the so- called neutral rate in the long run fell to 2.75 per cent, from 3 per cent in the previous forecasts from September. The median projection is for the benchmark rate to end 2021 at 3.1 per cent, down from a prior estimate of 3.4 per cent.Possible PauseThose are more acknowledgments that rates are moving closer to the point where policy makers will at least take a break from the quarterly procession of hikes they pursued throughout 2018.When taken together, the latest quarter-point move, language changes and shift in rate projections indicate continued confidence in the economy, yet also greater caution over how far and fast the Fed expects to move with future hikes. As Powell has said, the Fed is now feeling its way forward and will act in line with how the economy performs.Investors have had a more pessimistic view than the Fed, foreseeing one increase at most in 2019, according to interest- rate futures prices.In a related move, the Fed lifted the interest rate it pays on bank reserves deposited at the central bank by just 20 basis points, instead of the usual 25 basis points that would match the quarter-point increase for the fed funds target range. As with a similar move in June, the action was aimed at containing the effective fed funds rate inside the target range.Careful BalanceHe\u2019ll be aiming to strike a careful balance, expressing a still-positive view on the U.S. economy without telegraphing a policy outlook that investors might view as too aggressive for an economy that appears somewhat more fragile than just a few months ago.While job creation has slowed slightly, over the past several months it has still easily outstripped the number needed to accommodate population growth. Unemployment in November remained at 3.7 per cent, its lowest since 1969. That has helped lift wages but hasn\u2019t provoked any serious signs of excessive inflation.Still, many forecasters expect growth to slow in 2019 and into 2020, and the Fed\u2019s median estimate for gross domestic product expansion in 2019 fell to 2.3 per cent from 2.5 per cent.Previous hikes and a stronger dollar will gradually bite into the economy just as fiscal stimulus fades and foreign economies from China to Europe also cool. Meanwhile, the ongoing trade dispute with China and a potentially chaotic exit for the U.K. from the European Union represent significant additional risks.Financial markets have been turbulent for weeks, with the S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks dropping 13 per cent from the end of September through Tuesday. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries have also been volatile, dropping to 2.82 per cent this week after hitting a seven-year high of 3.26 per cent in October.Powell\u2019s task is also complicated by the repeated attacks from Trump.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Toronto condo party to sober up in 2019, developers say, but don't expect prices to go down", "description": "Developers may be cautious short-term, but are confident prices will continue to rise longer term due to supply constraints and Toronto's growth prospects", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-condo-party-likely-to-sober-up-in-2019-developers-say", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/condos.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 18, 2018 11:17 AM EST", "content": "After a three-year non-stop party, Toronto\u2019s condo market is likely to settle down in 2019, some of the city\u2019s biggest developers say.\u201cI can\u2019t, for a minute, imagine that we\u2019re going to continue to see the increases that we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d said Jim Ritchie, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Tridel. \u201cDo I think there\u2019s still room for growth?

The segment soared amid the housing frenzy in the first half of 2017. While price gains have eased since then, they remain buoyant compared with the single-home segment which has been hit by harsher mortgage lending rules and rising interest rates.\u201cWe have hit the peak and I think prices will probably stay flat, for, I would even say the next two years,\u201d said Jane Renwick, vice president of marketing and sales at Diamond Kilmer Developments, a joint venture between Diamond Corp. and Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund. The group is developing its first project of about 250,000 square feet of housing in mid-rise condos and townhouses that will include a mix of market and affordable units.Shamez Virani, president at CentreCourt, added: \u201cThere is, for the first time in a little while, at least in the last 24 months, signs of resistance, signs of certain projects not being able to break barriers on pricing.\u201dAdditional condo cancellations are also likely due to rising construction costs that could offset revenue from presales and pressure margins, the developers said. Costs have increased across the board, including steel, due to tariffs, labour, municipal charges and land.This year, 15 buildings with more than 4,500 units have been cancelled, Urbanation said. That compares with 1,678 for 2017 and 379 for 2016.I promise you, pricing is going upJared Menkes \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen cost inflation in the construction space being in the range of 10 per cent this past year, which is something we hadn\u2019t seen previously,\u201d Virani said. \u201cThe theme of 2019 is about protecting your market, about ensuring that you\u2019re really being thoughtful about the timing and the allocation of costs, and selling and building in the same market environment so you don\u2019t get caught in that situation where you\u2019re forced to cancel a project.\u201dWhile the developers may be cautious short-term, all are confident that prices will continue to rise longer term due to supply constraints and Toronto\u2019s growth prospects. Gross domestic product in the city of 2.8 million people has been running at about 3.4 per cent for the past three years, above its population growth of 1.6 per cent, according to a city report.Jared Menkes, executive vice president of high-rise residential at Menkes Developments was unwavering for the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of red tape that\u2019s slowing down bringing more product to market,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cI promise you, pricing is going up.\u201dBelow are additional insights on what to expect in 2019:Jared Menkes on condo sales outlook in 2019:\u201cI think 2019, you\u2019re going be putting in more work just like for 2018 \u2014 it\u2019s not like it was 2016 or 2017, where you just opened the door and there\u2019s a line up around the block. It\u2019s rolling up your sleeves, telling the story, explaining the value proposition, the reasons to buying into this location.\u201dShamez Virani on shift to suburbs:\u201cThe big part of the solution is the 905. Municipalities like Vaughn, Mississauga, Markham and Richmond Hill are all municipalities that have realized that because of price appreciation, all of a sudden, there is development potential on a lot of their land. They\u2019re realizing that the City of Toronto is slowly closing the taps to new development and they\u2019re going to be the beneficiaries of it, so there\u2019s been this really meaningful shift in the last two years for developers to really go into the 905.\u201dJim Ritchie on condo price growth opportunities:\u201cThere are opportunities in 2019 where there could be reasonably good price increases depending on the product and where it is. There are some parts in our city that have a lot more competition and are building very similar product lines, maybe in that particular circumstance, we\u2019re not going to see as much inflation, but you really have to break it out and look at it.\u201dJane Renwick on affordable housing:\u201cBefore, development didn\u2019t happen east of Yonge because of Regent Park and Moss Park and where we had these areas where we had a concentration of social housing as opposed to it being integrated among market housing.

Fresh evidence of that came out just minutes after his latest salvo. The New York Fed\u2019s Empire State manufacturing index tumbled this month to a 19-month low.For months, Trump has accused the central bank of undermining the economy\u2019s growth by hiking interest rates. U.S. presidents have typically refrained from encroaching on the independence of the Fed.\u201cThe criticism by the administration of the Fed is not going to stop, and it\u2019s likely to intensify,\u201d said Joshua Feinman, global chief economist at DWS in New York and a former Fed staff economist. \u201cThe president stakes so much of his claim to achievement on the stock market and economic performance. He\u2019s worried about whether that will falter, so he\u2019s setting up the Fed to take the blame.\u201dAfter the Fed\u2019s Dec. 18-19 meeting, expectations of further hikes shrink, with investors betting on only one more move. The consensus among economists is for two 2019 hikes. That is partly due to Fed officials signaling in recent speeches that their tightening campaign has succeeded in raising borrowing costs near to territory that they consider neutral in terms of speeding up or slowing the economy.Fed officials have also noted they are paying attention to risks such as slowing growth in Europe and in interest-sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy. Financial conditions have also tightened, partly because of stock-market losses on the White House\u2019s harsh rhetoric on trade and fears that uncertainty over Trump\u2019s policies could hit long-run investment spending.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Carolynn Look", "title": "ECB ends historic stimulus push even as eurozone looks vulnerable again", "description": "Whether it worked is debatable", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/ecb-ends-historic-stimulus-push-in-bet-economic-growth-to-endure", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/mario-draghi.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 13, 2018 8:36 AM EST", "content": "The European Central Bank took the watershed decision to halt its 2.6 trillion-euro (US$3 trillion) bond-buying program, capping massive monetary support even though the euro-zone economy looks vulnerable again.Policy makers led by President Mario Draghi confirmed that they\u2019ll stop net purchases this month, ending almost four years of quantitative easing. Signalling it\u2019s still a way from tightening policy, the Governing Council changed its guidance to say maturing debt will be reinvested \u201cfor an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.\u201d Rates will remain at record lows \u201cat least through the summer\u201d of 2019.While the decision will likely be welcomed by nations such as Germany that have long complained about ultra-loose policy, it comes at a testing time. Updated economic projections to be released by Draghi will show downgrades to the inflation and growth outlooks, according to people familiar with the matter.The president will explain his thinking to reporters at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt, when he\u2019ll face questions on the slowing momentum as well as a range of risks including skittish global markets, U.S. trade protectionism, Brexit and Italy\u2019s fiscal tensions.The euro fluctuated on the news, and was little changed at US$1.1382 at 1:49 p.m. Frankfurt time.QE started in the euro area in March 2015 in the hope that it would stave off the threat of deflation by pushing down market interest rates and encouraging risk-taking. It was launched months after the Federal Reserve stopped its own program and only after battles within the Governing Council, which had already cut interest rates below zero, with German policy makers leading the opposition.Initially it was supposed to run for less than two years, yet multiple extensions along with other monetary measures such as long-term bank loans bloated the ECB\u2019s balance sheet to 4.7 trillion euros. That\u2019s equivalent to more than 40 per cent of economic output, compared with 20 per cent at the Fed.Whether it worked is debatable. According to the ECB\u2019s latest estimate, the purchases will have added a cumulative 1.9 percentage points each to growth and inflation from 2016 to 2020. Euro-area growth also outpaced the U.S. in 2016 and 2017.Yet some economists including CME Group\u2019s Erik Norland say the ultimate benefit for growth was a lot closer to zero, as there was no obvious impact when the pace of bond-buying started to slow. Critics in Germany blame QE for saving governments such as Italy\u2019s from taking needed steps to reform their economies.The announcement, confirming a plan first agreed in June, came after a spate of central-bank decisions in Europe. The Swiss and Norwegian central banks left policy unchanged, though the Swiss National Bank cut its inflation outlook.Turkey and Ukraine also kept rates on hold. The Fed is set to hike rates next week for the fourth time this year.Recent euro-area economic data highlight how the summer slowdown \u2014 including contractions in Germany and Italy \u2014 is proving tough to overcome. Purchasing managers are even less optimistic about growth than they were before the start of QE.At the same time, Draghi can point to wage gains in the euro area that are at the strongest in a decade.

It will likely include incentives for capital investment but not an across-the-board reduction in corporate taxes.The government has frustrated some business leaders with an agenda heavily focused on social issues and riled economists by running unnecessary deficits. Morneau\u2019s last federal budget \u2014 which punted infrastructure investments in favour of new program spending \u2014 landed in February without a mention of U.S. tax reform despite calls to keep pace.Foreign tech brings cash and jobs, but at what price?Joe Oliver: Canada\u2019s bleeding capital and competitiveness. Won\u2019t Morneau do something to help?Sure, excess regulation is holding Canada back, but who really has the will for change?\u201cWhat people will be looking for is a clear statement from the government that they understand how serious the challenges are that businesses face today,\u201d Perrin Beatty, head of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s a sense of urgency in addressing those issues.\u201dIn addition to U.S. tax cuts, business leaders have warned a rising regulatory burden and other changes, such as minimum wage hikes and a carbon tax, are making the country less attractive to investment at a time when it needs new drivers of growth. Most economists believe the nation\u2019s highly indebted households are about to tap out and slip into a long-term slump as interest rates rise, with consumer spending projected to slow down to some of the weakest levels on record outside of recession.What to ExpectOne thing that\u2019s certain to appear in the fiscal update is red ink, according to Craig Wright, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cOttawa long ago abandoned any pretense of balancing the budget,\u201d he wrote in a Nov. 13 research note. \u201cOngoing fiscal stimulus is putting added strain on capacity as well as upward pressure on interest rates.\u201dMorneau has already dropped hints about what the document will include. It will respond to the need to \u201cmake investments on a competitive basis,\u201d the finance minister told reporters last week, a likely reference to being able to more quickly write off business capital expenses. However, Morneau said he would do so \u201cin a prudent way,\u201d signalling he won\u2019t usher in across-the-board, immediate write-offs. He also hinted at regulatory reform, particular in the energy sector.\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau walks with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau before tabling the budget in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018. Bill Morneau will present a fiscal update on Wednesday.\n\nJustin Tang/The Canadian Press\n\n\u201cWe are going to look towards making sure that businesses can feel their opportunity to create investments and create jobs is positive in Canada while always ensuring that we address the importance of long-term, fiscally sustainable approaches,\u201d Morneau said on a conference call last Monday from Beijing, where he and Trade Minister Jim Carr were holding sector-by-sector talks with their Chinese counterparts.Business leaders have been essentially biting their tongues over the last year as Trudeau\u2019s team dealt with U.S. trade talks. But now businesses are growing frustrated by what many say is a government that doesn\u2019t regularly talk about economic issues. Frustration is particularly high in western Canada, where pipeline capacity and a supply glut have brought prices for heavy Alberta crude to record lows. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts are only amplifying calls for action.It would be unfortunate if they want to crawl their way to the right place, because that doesn't align with how businesses make decisionsGoldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada \n \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping for is action that responds to what has taken place,\u201d said Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, which represent the chief executives of top firms. The council wants government to streamline regulations and review personal income tax brackets that make it tough to recruit top talent. It has also called for a temporary, 100 per cent write-off on capital investment like machinery and equipment purchases. Mostly, though, Hyder said Trudeau and Morneau need to act quickly.\u201cIt would be unfortunate if they want to crawl their way to the right place, because that doesn\u2019t align with how businesses make decisions,\u201d Hyder said in a phone interview last week.Last ChanceAfter the fiscal update, Morneau\u2019s last big publication before the 2019 election will be next year\u2019s budget \u2014 which will be a de facto platform complete with new spending pledges ahead of the vote in October. That essentially makes this week\u2019s document his last significant chance to respond to business concerns.Dennis Darby, president of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters industry group, said its members want Canada to match U.S. capital cost allowances in scope to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d with their American competitors. \u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that Minister Morneau has been listening,\u201d he said by phone.The group also favours comprehensive tax reform and wants government to find a resolution to the tariff fight with the U.S. on steel and aluminum. Though his group is broadly supportive of the government\u2019s social agenda, Darby acknowledged there\u2019s growing impatience among some for the government to talk about their issues too.\u201cWhen are we going to focus on the economy?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your chance to say, yeah, we understand and we\u2019re going to redouble our efforts.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Canadians appear to have dodged that housing crash everybody's been so afraid of for 10 years", "description": "How did we manage that?", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-housing-market-shows-increasing-signs-of-soft-landing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 16, 2018 2:48 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s once-lofty housing market is achieving a best-case soft landing for policy makers trying to cool things down without triggering a collapse.The latest string of data indicates the market is experiencing only a modest adjustment in prices in the face of higher interest rates and tougher regulations brought in to tackle a boom that saw values more than double in Toronto and Vancouver since 2009.It\u2019s a Goldilocks scenario that reduces risk in what had become the economy\u2019s main vulnerability \u2014 an impressive achievement only a year after the country suffered a crisis of investor confidence because of debt and housing worries.Why your neighbour\u2019s kid is getting a better mortgage rate than youHousing market not headed for a major correction: Moody\u2019s AnalyticsLocation, location, location: Why our national housing market is a myth\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good spot to be in, avoiding boom but avoiding bust as well,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada Global Asset Management in Toronto, said in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cThe rule changes that have been made have been effective in cooling these markets down.\u201dCanada\u2019s housing boom appears to have come to an end in the middle of last year, following an eight-year ascent that saw national home prices rise by nearly 80 per cent. Since then, they\u2019ve been little changed even as market transactions have fallen sharply.To be sure, risks remain. Young home buyers have never faced anything other than historically low mortgage rates and many will have to refinance over the next few years, while policy makers remain concerned about a cluster of highly indebted borrowers.Growing signs of a sustainable housing market allow the Bank of Canada to keep moving ahead with modest interest-rate increases in an economy that\u2019s otherwise at full capacity. Government officials can also hold back on new interventions that could spook households.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re settling into this environment in Canada where price growth is going to be flat in real terms,\u201d something that hasn\u2019t happened outside of a recession since the 1990s, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said by phone from Toronto.Prices and sales showed modest gains or losses for October in reports Thursday from the Canadian Real Estate Association and from the Teranet land registry. That\u2019s a switch from most of the last year where they swung in response to tougher mortgage qualification rules and the first interest-rate hiking cycle from the central bank in almost a decade.\u2018Medicine Is Working\u2019Home sales held close to their 10-year average after falling for a second month in October, the realtor group said. Benchmark prices rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, and gains in Vancouver and Toronto were close to the national average.Canada would stand out if it comes through its housing boom without a crash like those seen in the U.S., the U.K. or Spain. \u201cOverall, yes the medicine is working,\u201d Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe are reaching some sort of landing, how soft it will be I don\u2019t know, but we aren\u2019t in a free-fall by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Tal said.Even with the latest figures showing stability, it could take years to unwind the imbalances that have built up. The rise of the million-dollar home in some of Canada\u2019s biggest cities has also created affordability challenges for buyers as builders struggle to offer new supply.\u201cIts absolutely fair to say the Canadian housing market is off the boil,\u201d Lascelles said, adding a note of caution: \u201cThere is no pre-ordained conclusion here.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Ontario sharpens axe as it readies plan to cut mounting $15-billion deficit", "description": "Ontario has the world's largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt, clocking in at $338 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/ontario-sharpens-axe-as-it-readies-plan-to-cut-mounting-deficit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ontario.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 15, 2018 9:43 AM EST", "content": "Investors will be watching for hints as how Ontario plans to start tackling the world\u2019s largest largest pile of sub-sovereign debt when the Canadian province gives a snapshot of its finances on Thursday.Finance Minister Victor Fedeli will unveil the new government\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook in the provincial legislature starting at about 1:15 p.m. While not an official budget, the document will outline the government\u2019s initial assessment of a province that\u2019s growing moderately while steadily racking up debt.Ontario\u2019s deficit is poised to reach about $15 billion (US$11 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, more than double the previous government\u2019s forecast, while net debt stands at about $338 billion, the highest of any sub-sovereign borrower rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service.Canada\u2019s economic Achilles heel: A mountain of household debtIf Doug Ford honours his campaign promises, Ontario\u2019s deficit monster will grow to $18.7 billion next yearIt\u2019s not just taxes \u2014 here is what\u2019s really killing Canada\u2019s competitiveness\u201cGiven that the new government stands for good management, I would expect them to address the deficit as a priority,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI would expect a significant reduction of the deficit fairly early in its mandate.\u201dPremier Doug Ford has committed to balancing the books over time and has already begun to rein in spending, scrapping a pilot basic income program and capping social assistance. Together with other measures, that could save $2 billion this year, according to report from Toronto-Dominion Bank last week. Allowing other programs to lapse could save another $1 billion while freezing a minimum wage hike may support employment and boost revenues, the bank said.Rising RatesBut the Progressive Conservative government, which swept to power in June, also made some costly campaign pledges which could push the budget shortfall to as high as $18.7 billion in 2019-20, according to TD. Those promises included a cut to corporate and personal income taxes and reduction in the gas tax.\u201cHow this is going to line up with the campaign promise to balance is going to be interesting,\u201d said Joey Mack, Toronto-based director of fixed income at GMP Securities LP. \u201cBut given all the announcements pointing to huge deficits, I don\u2019t think we will get too much reaction\u201d if the deficit stays below $18 billion, he said.Ontario is expected to grow at about 2 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent next year according economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Ontario bonds have declined 1.5 per cent this year, trailing the 1.3 per cent drop for Quebec and 1.1 per cent for the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch bond index of provincial borrowers.

Since the end of June, when Ford took office, the yield investors demand to hold province\u2019s debt maturing between three months and five years have increased between 40 and 50 basis points, Bloomberg data show.\u201cAn interest rate increase of 25 basis points will cost Ontario taxpayers an additional $100 million a year in interest payments,\u201d Fedeli wrote in a Nov. 1 opinion column for the Toronto Sun. \u201cFor the government of Ontario, interest rate increases pose a significant challenge.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
