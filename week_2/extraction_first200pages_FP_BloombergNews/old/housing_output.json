The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund\u2019s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.\u201cThe Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,\u201d the company said in a fund document on its website. \u201cThe social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.\u201dThe fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company\u2019s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.\u2018Pandemic Effects\u2019The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada\u2019s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201d The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn\u2019t say how long the freeze would last to \u201cavoid building unrealistic expectations\u201d.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello", "title": "A fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec", "description": "Quebec is urging its population to buy from local firms through an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/a-fight-against-amazon-becomes-a-state-matter-in-quebec", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 25, 2020 8:02 AM EDT", "content": "The coronavirus crisis is giving Quebec\u2019s nationalist government an excuse to attempt what may be impossible.The Canadian province is embarking on an uphill battle to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s position. Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers\u2019 digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu \u2014 or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province\u2019s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe\u2019s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon\u2019s dominance. \nBezos, Musk among billionaires gaining net worth in pandemic -report\nAmazon moves to stock more non-essential items \u2014 but it\u2019s not business-as-usual\nCanada signs agreement with Amazon to manage distribution of medical equipment\n\u201cPeople will be able to see what\u2019s available in their region,\u201d Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.\u201dQuebec\u2019s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company\u2019s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,\u201d Lecours said. \u201cStill, let\u2019s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it\u2019s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?\u201dEfforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch \u2014 including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV\u2019s beer.\n\nQuebec Premier Francois Legault.\n\nJacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press\n\nWhen Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer \u2014 an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.\u201cAn initiative to promote local commerce isn\u2019t an initiative against free trade,\u201d Fitzgibbon said then. \u201cIt\u2019s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.\u201dThe Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn\u2019t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it\u2019s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the \u201cBuy Quebec\u201d movement to stay.\u201cNo one can compete with Amazon,\u201d she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don\u2019t sell on the behemoth\u2019s platform, \u201cwe have some exclusivity they don\u2019t have.\u201d\u2018I Made No Money\u2019Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling \u201cBlack Friday level traffic every day\u201d to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault\u2019s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.\u201cI made no money,\u201d he said. Shipping costs \u201cis what\u2019s hurting everyone.\u201dTaillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket\u2019s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers\u2019 attention.\u201cOur goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,\u201d he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, \u201cit will have been worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales plunge 69% in first half of April as buyers, sellers stay home", "description": "Prices dip 1.5%, signalling market still tight", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-plunge-69-in-first-half-of-april-prices-dip?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/house-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 7:36 AM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales and listings plunged in the first part of April as the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand in Canada\u2019s largest city.Greater Toronto saw 1,654 home sales in the first 17 days of April, a 69 per cent drop from the same period a year ago.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm. \nHome sales activity crashed last month, but here\u2019s why property prices will not \u2014 for now\nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nHow to buy and sell a house in the time of coronavirus, from virtual tours to hazmat home inspections\n\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were.

Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.\n\nResidential condo buildings and single family houses are seen above Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDarryl Dyck/Bloomberg files\n\nThat virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted \n \nToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dAirbnb Customers VanishIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.\n\nThe logo of the online lodging service Airbnb on a smartphone.\n\nLionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nThen there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove, Sandrine Rastello, Kait Bolongaro and Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Provinces take baby steps in coming up with plans to get people back to work", "description": "Effort likely to be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks \u2014 and it will be months, if not longer, before country runs anywhere near capacity", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-provinces-covid-19-return-work-plans?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/legault.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 10:53 AM EDT", "content": "When workers at Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. report back to work Wednesday at the LaRonde gold mine in Quebec\u2019s Abitibi region, they\u2019ll arrive in staggered groups at three separate entrances.

California and some of America\u2019s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has \u201ctotal\u201d authority to reopen the world\u2019s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is \u201ccoordinating\u201d his country\u2019s response.\u201cWe are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,\u201d he said a news conference in Ottawa. \u201cWe recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We\u2019re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we\u2019re going to reopen the economy. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be a while still.\u201dDiscussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillJustin Trudeau \n \nIn Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company\u2019s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company\u2019s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.\u201cWe can\u2019t be locked down forever,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThe virus will still be around us. It won\u2019t be eradicated so it\u2019s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.\u201dAny return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Cautious StepsDr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia\u2019s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions \u201cto get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,\u201d but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak\u2019s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.\u201cWe will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,\u201d Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back onlineFrances Donald \n \n\u201cThe services side of the business, that\u2019s harder,\u201d Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg television. \u201cYou can open your coffee shop again, but if people don\u2019t feel confident to go to it, then you\u2019re not going to see your economy come back online.\u201dAgnico-Eagle\u2019s Boyd said the return to work is strictly voluntary. The company has 900 permanent staff at the LaRonde mine.\u201cIt will be gradual and if we see things that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, clearly we won\u2019t go forward with it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Catherine Bosley, Max Reyes and Jeff Green", "title": "Millennials are getting crushed by back-to-back economic crises", "description": "Economic downturns are inevitable, but they're not usually so severe.

The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They\u2019re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, \u201cI worry even more about the people without college diplomas.\u201d\n\nBaby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs.\n\nJohannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nWhile white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall.

It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt \n \nHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dRebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada ramps up asset buying to backstop coronavirus-slammed economy", "description": "CMHC announced Thursday it will buy up to $150 billion of mortgages from banks, triple the amount announced two weeks ago", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-ramps-up-asset-buying-to-backstop-virus-slammed-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/poloz-6.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 1:26 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s government and central bank are gearing up to acquire hundreds of billion of dollars in assets from the financial system in coming weeks in order to keep markets running smoothly during the pandemic-induced economic shutdown.The national housing agency announced Thursday it will buy up to $150 billion (US$107 billion) of mortgages from banks, triple the amount announced two weeks ago, to pump money into the economy hit hard by social-distancing measures and mandated business closures. The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers. \nOttawa asks banks, credit-card companies to lower interest rates\n\u2018We will overcome this:\u2019 G20 leaders vow to strengthen global financial safety net\nJack M. Mintz: Canada needs to think BIG now to avoid a long, deep recession\n\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Paula Sambo", "title": "Canada beefs up liquidity plan with pledge to buy up to $50 billion in uninsured mortgages", "description": "Changes will allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canada-beefs-up-liquidity-plan-with-expanded-mortgage-guarantee", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 20, 2020 2:14 PM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government announced it will guarantee previously uninsured mortgages, allowing it to acquire these loans in a $50 billion (US$34.8 billion) state purchase program.The step is aimed at making it easier for smaller institutions \u2014 which may not have enough insured loans \u2014 to participate in the liquidity boosting plan, analysts said.\u201cThese are extraordinary times and we are taking extraordinary measures,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this measure, banks and lenders will have more liquidity \u2014 which, in turn, will enable them to work on a case by case basis with Canadian businesses and individuals who face hardship at this time.\u201d \nAlmost 33% of Canadian households rent their homes.

Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.\u201dCrane operators have been called the \u201crock stars\u201d of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeMathew Tiburcio, crane operator \n \nIt\u2019s part of a decade-long building boom in North America\u2019s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada\u2019s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He\u2019s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada\u2019s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.\n\nCranes operate over the CIBC Square construction site in Toronto.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nTiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane\u2019s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He\u2019ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane\u2019s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.\u201cYou\u2019ve got many trades that need the crane and you\u2019re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,\u201d said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. \u201cEverybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.\u201dAt 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.\n\nToronto has more cranes than any other city in North America.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nBut the job hasn\u2019t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who\u2019s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.\u201cHe already knows all about tower cranes,\u201d Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio\u2019s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He\u2019s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him.

The figures mark a divergence from the U.S., where women eclipsed men as the majority of jobholders.The fastest pace of immigration in the Group of Seven is a big factor behind the trend in Canada, spurring a housing boom that\u2019s pushing up demand for everything from plumbers to electricians. A fast-track visa process is also pulling in workers to the male-dominated field of technology, while male immigrants are more likely than women to work outside the home. \nCanada\u2019s economy has \u2018free money lying on the sidewalk\u2019 and nobody is picking it up\nCanada\u2019s economy just had its second-best year for jobs since 2007\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nCanada notched another solid year of job gains in 2019, with the unemployment rate hovering near a four-decade low of 5.6 per cent. The female unemployment rate dipped even lower than men, reaching a record 4.9 per cent in May but the big job gains have skewed male.Jared Menkes, executive vice president at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd., said finding enough labour is a constant source of angst. Central Toronto posted the fastest-growing population in North America last year with a dozen office buildings and countless condos under construction, along with 25 light rail stations, hospitals and all sorts of infrastructure work.\u201cWe are short actual labour, whether it\u2019s a crane operator, whether it\u2019s drywallers, electricians, plumbers, drivers,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cWe\u2019re short truck drivers, architects, consultants.\u201dOntario LeadsTo be sure, the headline figures mask stark regional disparities that underscore the difficulties Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing. Much of the job creation has been in central Canada while parts of the West struggle with a slump in the energy sector that has gutted thousands of jobs. Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau\u2019s Liberals push to reduce Canada\u2019s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 \u2014 sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O\u2019Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario\u2019s resurgence.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in life,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto\u2019s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think since this job started I\u2019ve worked less than a 60-hour week.\u201d\n\nThe CIBC Square tower under construction in Toronto.\n\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg files\n\nJust under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has also clamped down on visas for the high-tech sector, a source of jobs growth in Canada.Male immigrants are more likely to participate in the workforce than women, who often face additional barriers, according to Parisa Mahboubi, a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto.\u201cGenerally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cHowever, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.\u201dTech ManiaThe broad-ranging category of \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical services,\u201d which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn\u2019t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that\u2019s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, managing director at hireVouch \n \nPatrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can\u2019t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.\u201cAlmost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hardest time if you\u2019re an employer, but if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.\u201dOutlookRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.\u201cA growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can\u2019t find work,\u201d Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O\u2019Neill, the crane operator, doesn\u2019t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.\u201cShe\u2019s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, too.

That reflects an economy running nicely at around its capacity \u2014 neither too hot nor too cold. \nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: Data warnings still flashing as Bank of Canada decides on rates\nRemember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nOil remains a pillar of Canada's economy, but it's the digital economy that's driving growth\nOf course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it\u2019s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than 1 per cent for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists.But the net effect of the changes isn\u2019t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada means the economy probably had less slack to begin with.A weak fourth quarter also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front.Home PricesOfficials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern.Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That\u2019s one more reason not to cut.Core MandateTo be sure, Poloz won\u2019t hesitate to lower rates if there\u2019s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank\u2019s primary inflation-targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern.So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While investors are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June.Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz\u2019s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008. So did Gordon Thiessen in 2001.That said, as long as the economy remains in a relatively good place and household debt levels continue to pick up, Poloz may be content to simply stand pat before he stands down.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Here's David Rosenberg's bear-case portfolio to help you weather a looming economic slowdown", "description": "Gold is a 'no-brainer'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/gold-is-a-no-brainer-in-rosenbergs-bear-case-portfolio?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/david-rosenberg.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 21, 2020 10:03 AM EST", "content": "Shelter in gold, bet on emerging markets and buy \u201cbonds in drag.\u201dSo says David Rosenberg who believes an economic slowdown is on its way despite enduring job gains, easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and record-breaking stock markets in North America.\u201cIf things are so great, why did the Fed have to cut rates last year?\u201d he said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cIf things are so great, why did the Fed have to embark on QE4, that we\u2019re not supposed to call QE4?\u201d \nDavid Rosenberg says energy shares are \u2018downright cheap\u2019 right now\n\u2018I\u2019m chasing a lifelong dream\u2019: David Rosenberg says opening his own shop not a response to Onex takeover\nDavid Rosenberg: The Fed seems to think we are in a happy economic place \u2014 but we aren\u2019t\nRosenberg started his own independent research firm in January \u2014 Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc. \u2014 after more than a decade as chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.

Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor.

Fewer respondents, for example, expected a U.S. recession The survey questions with the biggest improvements were around indicators of future sales and employment intentions. The share of firms planning to expand their workforce rose to 53 per cent, the highest since the second quarter 2018. Indicators of future sales also rose to the strongest in more than a year Outside the energy-producing regions, reports of improved indicators of future sales are widespread, with businesses pointing to infrastructure and resource projects, population growth, consumer spending and housing activity supporting demand for their products \u201cThe share of firms reporting at least some capacity pressure edged up for a third straight quarter (53 per cent), in part because of labour shortages. That gauge is above its historical average of 43 per cent. The data suggest \u201ceconomic slack has been absorbed\u201d and that \u201clabour markets have tightened \u201cOn the down side, while businesses are reporting stronger bookings and orders, fewer firms expect sales growth to accelerate over the next 12 months.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canadian housing starts miss forecasts for the third straight month", "description": "Still, a strong showing in Alberta helped to counter declines in other areas", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-starts-miss-forecasts-for-3rd-straight-month-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/alberta-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2020 11:12 AM EST", "content": "Canadian housing starts declined in the final month of 2019, led lower by multiple-unit construction.Builders began work on an annualized 197,300 units in December, down 3.4 per cent from a revised 204,300 in the prior month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said in a statement Thursday.

That\u2019s bad news for an economy that\u2019s been relying heavily on the consumer to drive growth, given the country\u2019s weak investment and export record over the past decade.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cCanada\u2019s expansion will be lacklustre in 2020, with drags from debt-laden consumers, global trade risks and lingering business uncertainty. The open economy is not immune to slower growth in the U.S. or broader global manufacturing malaise.

Another sign of cautiousness: savings rates are inching higher and are now at the highest since 2015.Talk of a global recession in financial markets had been rife for much of last year, but those worries have faded significantly in recent weeks amid signs the global economy is stabilizing \u2014 helped by receding trade war risks between China and the U.S. and looser monetary policy in much of the world. At the same time, whatever growth there is will be modest.Economists predict Canada\u2019s economy will expand by a tepid 1.6 per cent this year, about the same as 2019. The U.S. economy is seen slowing to 1.8 per cent growth from 2.3 per cent in 2019.There are also indications that consumer worries have levelled off. The results are little changed from a similar poll taken at the end of November. A separate gauge of consumer confidence \u2014 the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index \u2014 saw a rebound in December from a two-month slide, as financial markets surged at the end of last year and sentiment around real estate recovered.Recession concerns are most pronounced in prairie provinces like Alberta, where almost three-quarters of households see a chance of a 2020 contraction. A majority of respondents in British Columbia and Ontario are also concerned a downturn is imminent. Quebec was the only province where optimists outnumbered pessimists.The results of the current survey are based on a hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,010 Canadians, between Dec. 22 and Dec. 29, and have a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

Along with declining birthrates, that helped slow annual population growth to the weakest in a century, according to an analysis by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.Last year, Canada added a net 437,000 people from abroad, despite being only a tenth the size of the U.S., helping to drive its fastest population increase in 30 years, even with declines in fertility. \nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nAll the reasons why Canada needs immigration \u2014 and more of it\nThe data show the two countries are relying on different drivers to counter the global trend of aging demographics.

This has helped to avoid the Japanification trap of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates that are slowly becoming evident in other parts of the world.This is the story I think markets are missing: how powerful immigration is at actually changing your financial marketsFrances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management \n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about the story however, from a strategist, like myself, is not even how it relates to GDP growth but how we\u2019re substituting one form of policy for another,\u201d Donald said.While Donald argues immigration can be a proxy for monetary policy, currency strategists say the central bank is still the main driver of the loonie, and immigration is more of a long-term variable that can influence policy.\u201cImmigration informs the output gap and hence policy stance,\u201d wrote Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. \u201cFX will react to how the Bank changes policy.\u201dCase in point, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has cited the country\u2019s robust labour force, supported by new entrants, as a reason for holding interest rates despite concerns around a slowdown.Relying on human capital to improve growth and inflation numbers over time actually acts as a curve steepener, Donald added. \u201cIf we rely on this so called human stimulus then we don\u2019t have to rely on monetary policy to the same extent.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ashley Robinson and David Scanlan", "title": "Billionaire Jim Pattison scraps Canfor bid after shareholders reject it", "description": "The proposal was rejected by 55 per cent of Canfor shareholders", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/canfor-shareholders-reject-great-pacifics-1-5-bln-offer-to-take-co-private", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/canfor.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 17, 2019 9:02 AM EST", "content": "Billionaire Jim Pattison scrapped his bid to take Canfor Corp. private after minority shareholders in the Canadian lumber company rejected the offer as too low given the turnaround in the sector.Investors voted 45 per cent in favor of the $16 a share offer, according to a tally of votes cast Monday, Canfor said in a statement.

Poloz could lower rates if he sees the uncertainty spilling over into the nation\u2019s economy, particularly if it begins to crimp consumer sentiment.But it will be a delicate balancing act. With the economy near its capacity, policy makers will want to see either a clear materialization of downside risks to the global economy \u2014 for example, the collapse of talks between China and the U.S. \u2014 or some evidence domestically that the anticipated slowdown is sharper than expected..Third-quarter output data released Friday showed a benign picture, however. The economy did slow to an annualized pace of 1.3 per cent, but growth came in exactly as forecast by the Bank of Canada. Exporters, the most exposed to the global trade tensions, struggled as expected, but business investment surprised with a strong rebound. That, along with the pick up in consumption and housing and upward revisions to growth, will give policy makers plenty of positives to draw on as they deliberate policy this week.While there doubts remain about whether the jump in business investment is sustainable, consumption and housing seem to be on more solid footing \u2014 supported by a robust jobs market, cheaper mortgage loans thanks to lower global bond yields and accelerated wage gains.After the slowdown in the second half of 2019, growth should accelerate over the next two years back to around its potential as business investment and exports recover, and consumption growth holds steady, the Bank of Canada estimates. There are no obvious clues yet in the data that should knock the central bank off that view.That\u2019s not counting additional stimulus expected down the line from Justin Trudeau\u2019s government. The prime minister has pledged to ramp up federal deficits to $27 billion (US$20.3 billion) next year, bringing the budget gap to about 1.1 per cent of gross domestic product from about 0.9 per cent this year.The next couple of weeks should provide the first taste of what\u2019s in store, as lawmakers reconvene on Thursday.

That was down from a revised 3.5 per cent pace in the previous quarter that was largely seen as unsustainable. The period also ended as expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.1 per cent in September.While the slowdown last quarter marks a return to sluggish growth for the Canadian economy, the details of the report should provide some optimism about underlying strength domestically, even in the face of a weak trade sector, aided by a relatively robust jobs market and a rebound in housing. \nCanadian economy faces a prolonged period of sluggish growth\nDip in foreign investment into Canada masks best year since oil shock\nThere\u2019s a problem when analogue policy makers set the rules for a digital world\nResidential investment increased at an annualized pace of 13.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest since 2012. Growth in household consumption picked up to an annualized pace of 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, from 0.5 per cent the previous quarter.Non-residential business investment also surprised \u2014 given the global trade uncertainties \u2014 with spending on non-residential structures and machinery up 9.5 per cent. That fully recouped a drop in the second quarter.The end result was a 3.2 per cent increase in overall domestic demand, fully rebounding from a very weak second quarter when consumption slowed and investment contracted. These underlying details should give Bank of Canada policy makers pause about cutting rates to counter an expected slowdown. Swaps trading suggests investors are placing a two-thirds chance of a rate cut in the first half of next year.

That\u2019s the second straight draw down in inventories, and may still reflect concerns about the outlook.At the same time, fewer inventories will ease worries that stockpiles had grown too large, posing a risk to future growth.Exports dropped at an annualized pace of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, falling for a third time in the past four quarters.Households also seem to be repairing their balance sheets, with the country\u2019s savings rate jumping to the highest since 2015 in the third quarter.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Dip in foreign investment into Canada masks best year\u00a0since oil shock", "description": "More evidence capital flows are returning to levels from before the 2015 oil price collapse", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/dip-in-foreign-investment-into-canada-masks-best-year-since-oil-shock", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/currency.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 29, 2019 7:36 AM EST", "content": "Foreign direct investment into Canada fell slightly in the third quarter, but remained at elevated levels, adding to evidence capital flows are returning to levels from before the 2015 oil price collapse.FDI totalled $16.1 billion (US$12.1 billion) in the three months between July and September, down slightly from an inflow of $19.3 billion in the previous quarter that had been inflated by a mega merger.

The reversal has come in part as governments erected barriers to slow runaway price growth driven \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by all the billionaire investors who came before.The winners were cities such as Moscow, as rich Russians chose to buy at home, and Taipei, favoured over Hong Kong, the world\u2019s most expensive housing market.Even as the flow of investment has slowed, many developers are delivering projects started when the supply of rich buyers seemed to go on forever. Now there\u2019s a glut of luxury properties and \u2014 as anger mounts over wealth inequality \u2014 affordable units are in increasingly short supply.\u201cWe\u2019ve had an unprecedented run in high-end real estate and now many of these markets are struggling with excess supply or uncertainty,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. \u201c\u2018Uncertainty\u2019 is the most overused word in real estate right now and probably for good reason.\u201dTaxes on RichLondon and New York, among other cities, passed taxes aimed at rich buyers. While the levies effectively raised prices even further, they also provided governments with extra cash for city services, as foreign buyers don\u2019t pay income taxes. On the other hand, rich buyers also spend money on goods and services that boost local economies and sales tax revenue.Prices got too high and economic conditions changed, said Thomas Veraguth, the Zurich-based head of global real estate strategy for UBS Wealth Management. Waves of Middle Eastern and Russian buyers pulled back, for example, after the oil crash in 2014, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s fatigue,\u201d Veraguth said. \u201cEven the richest will say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to pay that price anymore.\u201dMarkets are shifting based on local conditions, said Kate Everett-Allen, a partner at Knight Frank in London. The U.S. election may cause buyers to pause in New York while the stability of the Swiss franc will continue to drive demand in Zurich and Geneva, she said.Moscow had the biggest price increase in Knight Frank\u2019s study, rising 11 per cent. With Russia under international sanctions after its annexation of Crimea, and anti-money laundering measures tightened in London and other cities favoured by that country\u2019s elite, many opt to buy property at home. Developers also completed a number of luxury properties in the Russian capital, increasing supply.Rich RussiansRussia has plenty of rich people. There are at least 189,500 ultra-high net worth individuals in the country controlling about US$1.1 trillion, according to Capgemini estimates. It\u2019s also incredibly unequal. There are 23 Russians on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people, worth about a combined US$271 billion.In total, there are more than 100 Russians with more than US$1 billion.Chinese buyers have slowed overseas purchases, in part because of government restrictions on getting money out. And buyers everywhere are dodging risk, skipping Hong Kong, the world\u2019s most expensive market and one now with political unrest, in favour of Taipei, which saw an 8.9 per cent price increase in the third quarter.While Brexit and taxes on second home buyers make London riskier and more expensive, buyers bid up prices by 10 per cent in Frankfurt, which is a banking capital with relatively affordable prices.When things go sideways around the globe, the U.S. has traditionally served as an island of safety and security, particularly for the world\u2019s wealthy.The two biggest cities in California, the state with America\u2019s worst affordability crisis, were near the bottom of Knight Frank\u2019s ranking. Los Angeles rose 0.2 per cent from a year earlier and San Francisco was flat.The U.S. is already home to more Hong Kongers than any country outside of mainland China, and recent data suggest more are looking to leave. Applications for a key emigration document, the \u201cgood citizenship card,\u201d are up 54 per cent in the past year, according to official data.But anti-immigrant political rhetoric, high-profile incidences of gun violence and impending changes to the \u201cinvestor visa\u201d program have encouraged Hong Kong\u2019s would-be emigres to consider alternatives such as Australia, Canada, Singapore and Taiwan.\u201cEverybody\u2019s pulling back \u2014 it\u2019s a crazy time,\u201d Edward Mermelstein, a partner at One & Only Holdings in New York, which runs family offices for foreigners. \u201cThe wealthy have always been an easy target and now that\u2019s a popular theme globally.

As economist Gray Kimbrough has documented, a large number of people in their 20s and early 30s live with their parents, while correspondingly fewer own their own homes. They\u2019re also significantly less likely to be married than past generations. \nMillennials are facing all the risk and none of the reward in today\u2019s financial realities\nRich, aging baby boomers will make it even harder for millennials to buy homes over next 10 years\nIt may take millennials 29 years to save enough to afford a home in Canada\u2019s biggest cities\nThese trends are among the reasons millennials are having fewer children. And those who do are having them later.Why have so many millennials experienced failure to launch? Part of it might simply be the result of changing culture; dating apps and a liberalization of sexual mores, as well as the rise of roommate living, may have made some millennials reluctant to give up the urban bohemian lifestyle. But this probably isn\u2019t a major reason. Surveys show that the average number of children women want has remained steady at about 2.5 since 1970 and may have even risen slightly. Meanwhile, the decline in marriage is much more pronounced among less educated and lower-income Americans.Instead of culture, millennials\u2019 lifestyles are best explained by education and economics.In the days of unions and manufacturing it was often possible to get a good middle-class job with only a high school degree. Those days are long gone. Since the early 1970s, weekly earnings for men without a college degree have declined while those for women have barely budged. The only men with rising earnings are those with post-college education. That implies that even a bachelor\u2019s degree is no longer enough to reach the middle class. Professional degrees, master\u2019s degrees and various forms of postgraduate certification are becoming the norm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb174a0966');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb174a0966');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-97a74cad752fee8565dc91fa26c986b8-5ebcb174a0966'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nThe rising importance of higher education means that a young person who could start a career at\u00a022 or even\u00a018 a few decades ago now has to wait until their late 20s or even later. That means that even educated millennials begin saving money much later in life, delaying the day when they\u2019ll be able to buy a house.It also may mean they earn less money over the course of their careers. Traditionally, earnings tend to plateau when people reach their mid- to late-30s. As education increases, this plateau might be pushed forward a bit, but research shows that older workers simply tend to be less productive on average; more education means a shorter window of prime working years\u00a0and a shorter window in which to accumulate the wealth necessary to raise kids.On top of that, millennials have had to fight against strong economic headwinds. A substantial percentage graduated during the Great Recession of 2008-9 or the years of slow growth that followed. Studies show that graduating into a recession reduces lifetime earnings. The housing bubble, meanwhile, dealt an unprecedented blow to the wealth of those in the middle of the distribution and lower.And on top of all that, inequality has risen substantially. Although educated millennials must delay saving for houses and kids, their less-educated peers are often never even able to start.So for many aging millennials, the lifestyle of extended adolescence \u2014 living with parents or roommates, finding dates on Tinder, starting relationships and breaking up again \u2014 is probably beginning to seem less like a never-ending party than a trap. Even modern workout regimens and diets can\u2019t eternally postpone the day when skin begins to sag, joints begin to creak and mental acuity begins to dull.Maybe it\u2019s no great surprise, therefore, that millennials are turning to socialism, clamouring for student-debt forgiveness and embracing presidential candidates who promise bold schemes of wealth redistribution. So this generation should be thought of not as youthful rebels infused with the vigour of naive idealism, but as embittered adults heading toward middle age before their finances are in order. More to the point, millennials are a lot like boomers who just never got a chance to boom.Bloomberg.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-d0913fc7bf2c60c7cfc6875836ea9d03-5ebcb174a0a42');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-d0913fc7bf2c60c7cfc6875836ea9d03-5ebcb174a0a42');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-d0913fc7bf2c60c7cfc6875836ea9d03-5ebcb174a0a42'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Crackdown on dirty money in Vancouver real estate continues with creation of new watchdog", "description": "British Columbia to introduce legislation late next year that would establish a joint financial-services and real estate watchdog by spring 2021", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/crackdown-on-dirty-money-in-vancouver-real-estate-continues-with-creation-of-new-watchdog?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/vancouver.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 12, 2019 4:18 PM EST", "content": "British Columbia plans to create a single real estate regulator to better combat money-laundering in markets like Vancouver, where the government says dirty money has helped drive up housing prices.The provincial government intends to introduce legislation late next year that would establish a joint financial-services and real estate watchdog by the spring of 2021, the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday.The plan would bring real estate regulation \u2014 including licensing \u2014 under the purview of the B.C.

The warning came just over an hour after the company posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter.A decade ago, Chesapeake was a US$37.5 billion company led by the energetic Aubrey McClendon, an outspoken advocate for the gas industry. Chesapeake became the second-largest U.S producer of the fuel. But in 2016, McClendon was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiring to rig bids for the purchase of oil and gas leases.

Its notice Tuesday comes as shale producers struggle to prove to investors they can produce positive cash flow, not just grow at any cost.When times were good, Chesapeake\u2019s campus was home to an army of construction cranes as McClendon, a graduate of Duke University, sought the look of a leafy private university for the company\u2019s headquarters.

All of that drew fire from investors, who said the company should focus more on oil and gas while selling non-core assets.The going-concern warning signals that Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler\u2019s six-year campaign to rescue Chesapeake from the billions of dollars in debts amassed by McClendon may be on the verge of failure. Lawler, who was hand-picked for the job by activist investor Carl Icahn, long sought to convert the gas giant into an oil company, to no avail.If oil and gas prices remain low, the company may not be able to comply with its leverage ratio covenant during the next year, \u201cwhich raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d Chesapeake said Tuesday in a quarterly filing. The warning comes less than a year after Lawler orchestrated the US$1.9 billion takeover of shale explorer WildHorse Resource Development Corp.Shares fell as much as much as 17 per cent, the most in more than three years. Chesapeake\u2019s 8 per cent coupon notes due 2025 are among the most actively traded securities in the high yield market, according to Trace. The bond\u2019s price dropped by over US$4, the largest price drop on record for the security. Chesapeake\u2019s 8 per cent coupon notes due 2027 also plunged to their lowest price ever.The shale boom has sent gas prices tumbling to less than US$3 per million British thermal units from an all-time high near US$16 in 2005. Terminals originally designed to import the fuel have been converted to export plants as the supply surge overwhelms domestic demand, leaving producers to seek international markets for their output.Chesapeake executives tried to assuage some fears on a third-quarter conference call. The producer continues to look at opportunities to improve its balance sheet, including asset sales, deleveraging acquisitions and capital funding options, they said.\u201cWe could go out and seek a waiver at any time from our bank group, but at the moment we continue to be focused on the strategic levers that result in permanent debt reduction,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Nick Dell\u2019Osso Jr. said.\u2018Massive Debt\u2019Chesapeake\u2019s borrowings totalled US$9.73 billion as of Sept. 30, up from US$8.17 billion at the end of last year.\u201cWith massive debt, leverage is not going down every quarter you continue to outspend,\u201d Neal Dingmann, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., said by phone. \u201cWhat is leverage going to look like next year and how are you going to address it internally or externally? That\u2019s the story.\u201dThough Chesapeake plans to reduce spending by almost a third next year as it seeks to generate free cash flow, its third-quarter capital expenditures rose 16 per cent from a year earlier as it completed more wells. The producer is standing by its budget guidance for full-year 2019.Chesapeake has already taken some steps to cut debt. In September, the company announced a $588 million debt-for-equity swap.

Compensation per employee at the Toronto-based firm is up 18.6 per cent since fiscal 2007 when adjusted for nominal wage growth, according to company filings and calculations by Bloomberg. That\u2019s made Chief Executive Officer Darryl White\u2019s mission to improve efficiencies more difficult.Canada\u2019s biggest banks are more profitable than ever, with years of low interest rates and a stable economy fuelling record consumer borrowing, and strong housing markets in Vancouver and Toronto spurring demand for mortgages. Like their counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the firms are increasingly turning to technology and automation to drive down costs. \nAs boomers cash out of their businesses, the big banks are cashing in through deal financing\nRoyal Bank of Canada cracks Wall Street\u2019s top 10 list for advising on M&A deals\nCanadian banks brace for tougher times as \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 era winds down\nThat\u2019s good for the banks, but less beneficial for workers: Average compensation across the biggest Canadian lenders is down 1.8 per cent over 11 years. Canadian banks that have made big forays into the U.S., as well as other regions with high wages, are bucking that trend.Bank of Montreal, which owns Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, took over Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in 2011, U.K. fund manager F&C Asset Management in 2014 and a transportation-finance business from General Electric Co. the following year, and there have been additional capital-markets deals in the U.S. since. Those acquisitions have swelled Bank of Montreal\u2019s ranks \u2014 with higher-paid professionals to boot.The company, meanwhile, has been working to control its expenses. It\u2019s targeting an adjusted efficiency ratio \u2014 a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue \u2014 of 58 per cent or better by the end of fiscal 2021. In the third quarter, it was 59.9 per cent, the lowest in at least six years.\u201cOur bank-wide revenue per employee is among the highest in the Canadian banking sector and, as a consequence, our cost per employee is on the higher side as well \u2014 the two items are very much related,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an email. \u201cWe continue to make progress on improving the bank\u2019s overall efficiency.\u201dU.S. PurchasesIt\u2019s not the only Canadian bank whose compensation has swelled with U.S. acquisitions.Toronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s 5.4 per cent increase in per-employee pay came after the company spent much of the early 2000s expanding in U.S. retail banking, with takeovers of Banknorth Group Inc. in Maine, Commerce Bancorp Inc. in New Jersey and South Financial Group Inc. to expand in Florida and the Carolinas. Those acquisitions helped fuel a 65 per cent expansion in Toronto-Dominion\u2019s workforce between 2007 and 2018.Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s business mix has much to do with a 7.1 per cent increase in per-employee compensation since 2007. Growth in wealth management and capital markets over the past decade at the country\u2019s largest lender has topped expansion at Canadian rivals, which have smaller operations in those areas. A drive to be a Top 10 investment bank in the U.S. also boosted pay, since capital-markets compensation is higher in the country than in Canada.Pay hasn\u2019t been an issue for all Canadian banks expanding abroad. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, for example, is seeing the benefits of taking over Cambodia\u2019s Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd., a process that began in 2014 with the purchase of a 10 per cent interest and grew into a 90 per cent controlling stake by 2016. National Bank\u2019s per-employee compensation dropped 20.5 per cent over 11 years.\u201cThe explanation is essentially the growth of the number of employees we\u2019ve had in Cambodia, where the average salary is significantly lower than the Canadian average,\u201d CEO Louis Vachon said in an interview. \u201cIn 2014, we had 600 employees in Cambodia, and by the end of this year we\u2019ll be over 5,000.\u201dLower WagesNational Bank acquired the rest of ABA Bank in October. Employees in Cambodia, who now represent almost a quarter of the parent company\u2019s overall workforce, have an average annual compensation of around $10,000, compared with $110,000 for Canadian employees, according to the bank.At Bank of Nova Scotia, a 14 per cent decline in per-employee compensation came after the Toronto-based company boosted its employee base by two-thirds in the 11-year period. About 80 per cent of the additional workers are in international banking, in countries with lower wages than in Canada. Scotiabank has expanded with several Latin American acquisitions, including purchases in Chile, Peru and Colombia.\u201cOur footprint is what makes Scotiabank unique,\u201d spokesman Clancy Zeifman said, \u201cand more than half of our employees work outside of Canada.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Sidewalk Labs closer to deal on Toronto \u2018city of the future\u2019 after two years of controversy, sources say", "description": "If no deal is struck, Sidewalk will be left empty handed after investing more than $50 million to develop the plan", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/alphabet-is-closer-to-a-deal-on-contentious-toronto-smart-city", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sidewalk.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 25, 2019 2:41 PM EDT", "content": "Larry Page\u2019s \u201ccity of the future\u201d is closer to approval in Toronto after two years of controversy threatened to scuttle the project.Sidewalk Labs LLC, the urban innovation unit of Alphabet Inc. and Waterfront Toronto, the public corporation in charge of the development, are finding common ground on a majority of contentious issues, according to people familiar with the discussions. The parties have been meeting ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline set by Waterfront to reach agreement on topics such as data privacy, land values and geographical boundaries, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.Sidewalk had proposed investing $1.3 billion  alongside local partners to kick off the development, anchoring Google Canadian headquarters in neighbouring Villiers Island. \nDigital experts raise data, privacy concerns in review of Sidewalk Labs project\nInside Sidewalk Labs\u2019 master plan to remake Toronto\u2019s eastern waterfront\nDown to Business podcast: Why Sidewalk Labs\u2019 sweeping Toronto smart city proposal faces hurdles\n\u201cThese discussions continue and no decisions have been made,\u201d Andrew Tumilty, spokesman for Waterfront Toronto, said in an email. \u201cBoth parties are working to ensure that a decision can be reached by the October 31 2019 deadline.\u201d A spokeswoman for Sidewalk Labs declined to comment.New York-based Sidewalk\u2019s plan for the 12-acre plot along Lake Ontario was launched with great fanfare in 2017.

If that goes ahead, the board will decide on March 31 whether to pursue implementation agreements with a deadline for finalizing a deal by Dec. 31, 2020. If no agreement is struck, the partnership will terminate and Sidewalk Labs will be left empty handed after investing more than $50 million to develop its 1,500-plus-page plan.Sidewalk released its master innovation and development plan in June, which raised many of the controversial issues now being discussed.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "From taxes to housing to pipelines: How a Liberal or Conservative win could affect Canada\u2019s economy", "description": "Either way most individual Canadians will pay lower taxes, while corporations will pay a bit more", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/how-a-liberal-or-conservative-win-could-affect-canadas-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/election.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 21, 2019 11:07 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economic landscape is poised to see some minor changes after Monday\u2019s election, regardless of whether Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals or Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives take power, though the big picture drivers and challenges to growth will largely remain unchanged.Here\u2019s what will, and won\u2019t, likely change after the vote.Fiscal PolicyOver the next couple of years, Canada is in store for more federal stimulus, regardless of the winner. This is due to the Liberal government\u2019s already budgeted spending increases which the parliamentary budget office projects will increase the deficit to $21 billion this year and $23 billion in 2020, from $14 billion in 2018.The Liberals are actually promising to add to that spending, and anticipate their deficits will jump to about $27 billion next year, exceeding 1 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time since 2012. The Conservatives meanwhile will adhere to the current deficit projection through 2020.Beyond 2020, a key policy divide emerges on closing the budget gap. Trudeau plans to run deficits of more than $20 billion every year during a second mandate, increasing the projected debt by $32 billion over that time. \nWhich party will be better for Canada's economy? There's one with a (marginally) better plan\nThese are the election promises that could affect your personal finances\nThese are the tax proposals that could affect your bottom line this election\nThe Conservatives argue this is an irresponsible approach, because it would cause future generations to pay for the increased public debt through higher taxes. They vow instead to close the budget gap within five years by cutting foreign aid and corporate handouts, as well as by expanding the time horizon for planned infrastructure spending, which would reduce the annual amount spent on large projects.TaxationMost individual Canadians will pay lower taxes, while corporations will pay a bit more. The most expensive campaign pledges for both parties are personal income tax cuts. The Liberals are pledging to raise the threshold under which no taxes are paid. The Conservatives plan to lower the rate of the lowest tax bracket. The cost for both is about $6 billion annually by 2023.While this is the main tax pledge for the Liberals, whose platform is more spend-heavy, the Conservatives are also planning a series of other tax cuts for households that will bring the total cost of their tax reductions to about $10 billion annually.Both parties, however, are planning to finance some of their measures by tapping corporate coffers. The Liberals plan to close corporate tax loopholes, while the Conservatives have pledged to cut corporate welfare \u2014 much of which comes in the form of tax credits. Both parties want to tax tech giants. These additional costs to corporations are marginal, and pale in comparisons to the higher corporate tax proposals made by the smaller left-leaning parties.Climate ChangeThe Conservatives have pledged to eliminate the carbon tax introduced by Trudeau\u2019s government earlier this year on holdout provinces with no carbon pricing. The Liberals plan to raise the minimum price provinces need to apply to greenhouse gas emissions to $50 a ton by 2022, from $20 a ton now, but the current program has considerable exemptions for large emitters. The Conservatives \u2014 who have adopted the same emission cut targets as the Liberals \u2014 want to shift the burden to large corporate emitters.PipelinesBoth main parties want to build the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which the Trudeau government bought last year for $4.5 billion after Kinder Morgan Inc. walked away. This project, anyhow, is out of the hands of politicians and in the hands of the courts.The bigger debate is whether the Trans Mountain pipeline \u2014 if it gets built at all \u2014 would be the country\u2019s last. The Conservatives claim the Liberals have put so many obstacles in the way of future development that no new energy infrastructure will ever be built, and have pledged to repeal tougher environmental and regulatory oversight while promoting an energy corridor across the country. The Liberals have shown little enthusiasm for new pipelines beyond Trans Mountain, and will face a major challenge even building that if they find themselves in a minority government needing the support of anti-pipeline parties.Housing TweaksResidential real estate is one of the hottest topics of the campaign, with all major parties saying they\u2019ll make it easier for Canadians to buy a home. Liberals are pledging to make their first-time home buyer incentive program \u2014 in which a government agency chips in on the downpayment \u2014 more generous. The Conservatives are planning to extend the maximum mortgage amortization period to 30 years for first time buyers and change controversial lending rules \u2014 the so-called stress tests \u2014 introduced under the current government.The New Democratic Party, currently running third in the polls in terms of popular vote and which could play an important role in a minority government, is planning to create half a million affordable housing units and scrap the federal sales tax on construction of rental space.ImmigrationThe surge of immigrants, along with temporary workers and international students, into the country has become a major driver of growth at a time when there are worries about the impact of high household debt levels and a global economic slowdown. The Liberals have announced a target to bring immigration to 350,000 by 2021, levels that haven\u2019t been hit in more than a century \u2014 which Scheer has indicated he will accept.Small BusinessCanada\u2019s small businesses can expect some relief no matter who wins. The Liberals are hoping to win back favour by promising to eliminate a double taxation on credit card transactions by doing away with \u201cswipe fees\u201d on sales taxes that merchants pay to credit card companies. This would save merchants around $500 million a year.The Conservatives are pledging to reverse Liberal tax changes for private corporations that outraged the small business community last year.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Susanne Barton", "title": "How the election result could clip the wings of Canada\u2019s high-flying loonie", "description": "A trader\u2019s guide to Canada\u2019s tight election", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-minority-rule-a-traders-guide-to-canadas-tight-election?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/loonie.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 18, 2019 2:12 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s dollar is the best-performing major currency this year and the nation\u2019s stocks are going strong. But now isn\u2019t the time for investors to rest on their laurels. The upcoming federal election is the next big event to test the market\u2019s resilience.With less than a week left to the Oct. 21 vote, Liberal Party Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in a neck-and-neck race with Conservatives leader Andrew Scheer. While the most likely scenario is a government that doesn\u2019t command an absolute majority in its own right, some strategists say that a minority administration led by Scheer could be better for the loonie in the near term than one under Trudeau.\u201cBetween a Liberal-led minority and a Conservative-led minority, we expect the first one to be more CAD-negative,\u201d Francesco Pesole, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank, said in an Oct. 17 report. \u201cThe balance of risks for the loonie appears tilted to the downside.\u201d( function() { pnLoadVideo( \"videos\", \"PvPQMElSILM\", \"pn_video_30964\", \"\", \"\", {\"controls\":1,\"autoplay\":0,\"is_mobile\":\"\"} ); } )();The loonie has been in the No. 1 spot among Group-of-10 currencies this year, rising almost 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar amid a sound economy and a low unemployment rate. Canada\u2019s benchmark equity index has rallied 15 per cent in 2019, making it one of the top gainers among developed markets. It was little changed against the greenback Friday.A Conservative minority government would be better for market sentiment than a Liberal minority administration, according to Pesole. He said this is in part because it would likely exclude smaller parties that oppose more oil pipelines, a subject that has been a focus of political debate. \nThese are the tax proposals that could affect your bottom line this election\nThese are the election promises that could affect your personal finances\nJack Mintz: Unity of Canada's polarized regions will be the ultimate test for election winner\nA rebound in housing, solid economic growth and one of the strongest job markets in recent times has helped give Trudeau something positive to talk about during his campaign. While major central banks in other parts of the world have been cutting interest rates, the Bank of Canada has been reluctant to do so thus far \u2014 strengthening the Canadian dollar\u2019s position as one of the highest yielders among G-10 currencies.Michael Hsueh, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, says a Trudeau-led minority government could be negative for the Canadian dollar given the reduced capacity to pass legislation. It could also potentially hinder growth in oil, a key industry for Canada, one of the world\u2019s largest energy exporters.The Oil FactorStewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of the elections. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and has promised to remove regulations Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.The loonie, often seen as a petrocurrency, has benefited from the nation\u2019s massive oil exports. Still, bringing more oil reserves to market has divided Canadians \u2014 with two pipelines being scrapped on Trudeau\u2019s watch.Foreign-exchange strategists are concerned that a Trudeau-led government, propped up by other left-leaning parties, could be an obstacle in passing legislation favourable to business leaders and the country\u2019s energy sector.A Liberal minority government is \u201clikely to push for more regulation and rules on capital inflows into Canada,\u201d which could be negative for the Canadian dollar, Mark McCormick, global head of currency strategy at Toronto-based TD Securities, said in an email.Stock MarketWhile Canadian politics rarely play a significant role in the nation\u2019s equity market, a minority government could be positive for stocks, according to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\u201cAlthough on average the market has posted relatively strong performance post federal elections, there appears to be little to no performance preference around the outcome,\u201d he said in a September report. \u201cThe only potentially meaningful outcome appears to be a minority government versus a majority government.\u201dSince 1935, Canadian stocks have returned on average 12 per cent in the 12 months after the election of a minority government, compared with 8 per cent in the year following a majority victory, according to Belski\u2019s research.For others, volatility is the name of the game. Stripping out the global rout in 2008, National Bank Financial\u2019s Warren Lovely said that Canadian stocks had a \u201cmixed/choppy\u201d performance after a minority government was formed from 2004 to 2011.\u201cIn terms of capital markets, the formation of a minority government creates greater potential uncertainty \u2013 especially if a coalition government is the end result,\u201d Credit Suisse\u2019s equity analyst Andrew Kuske said in an Oct. 8 report.Still, election-related market moves might be short-lived this month with both the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve reporting their monetary policy decisions on Oct. 30. Futures traders are pricing in almost no probability of a rate cut at the BOC meeting, while a quarter point reduction from the Fed is seen as likely by the market. Canadian two-year yields on Wednesday climbed above their U.S. equivalents by the most since 2017 \u2014 a good sign for loonie bulls.Trade deals will also have an impact on the Canadian dollar. The U.S. and China are still working to finalize their trade deal, which is likely to boost investors\u2019 appetite for risk, a positive for the currency. And on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC that he expects the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to be approved in Congress before the American Thanksgiving holiday.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson, Doug Alexander and Kevin Orland", "title": "David Rosenberg pegs Canada's recession odds at 80% in 'crude, condos and cannabis' economy", "description": "Some economists at Bloomberg's Canadian Fixed Income Conference say Canada won't be a bright spot in global economy for much longer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/david-rosenberg-pegs-canadas-recession-odds-at-80-in-crude-condos-and-cannabis-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadian-flag.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 17, 2019 2:07 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy has been a bright spot in the dimming global economy \u2014 but perhaps not for much longer, according to several bold calls at Bloomberg\u2019s Canadian Fixed Income Conference Wednesday.David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc., was the most bearish, putting odds of a recession in Canada at 80 per cent as slowing global growth swamps any fiscal stimulus ahead. He sees the Bank of Canada cutting interest rates four times as a result.\u201cThe way I look at the Canadian economy right now, it\u2019s really quite bifurcated,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cI call it the Triple C economy: there\u2019s crude, condos and cannabis.\u201d \nA fortune lies in the oilsands, but many voters want to leave it there\nCanadian business growing more frustrated as politicians focus on pocketbook issues over economy\nImproving job numbers, wages will keep fuelling our love of debt\nCanada has remained fairly resilient in the face of global weakness with rising immigration feeding labour market and wage gains, along with a rebounding housing market. But there are mounting concerns that it can\u2019t remain an indefinite holdout as the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown among trading partners take their toll.Rod Balkwill, executive director of Saskatchewan\u2019s Treasury Management Branch, said he sees a 60 per cent to 70 per cent risk of a recession, noting the housing market\u2019s strength is \u201cpretty narrowly based.\u201d Charles Allain, an executive director in Nova Scotia\u2019s finance department, said he\u2019s raised the odds substantially.\u201cThis time last year, I would\u2019ve said a very small potential of 10 per cent to 15 per cent,\u201d said Allain. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to think it\u2019s closer to 50 per cent now.\u201dThe consensus is that slower growth is on the horizon: economists expecting Canadian gross domestic product to decelerate to 1.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent last year. That\u2019s compared with 2.3 per cent forecast in 2019 for the U.S. from 2.9 per cent in the prior year.But predictions of recession were outliers at the conference. The probability of a recession was 25 per cent at the most recent Bloomberg survey of economists, compared with 35 per cent in the U.S.\u201cThe drivers of the economy continue to be our old friends of housing in particular coming back, but in terms of investment and trade we don\u2019t have a huge amount of optimism surrounding those sectors,\u201d said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, who sees a 30 per cent to 40 per cent chance.National Bank of Canada Chief Economist Stefane Marion concurred, saying the fundamentals that underpin the Canadian economy are still quite strong and inflation continues to hug the Bank of Canada\u2019s inflation target of 2 per cent.If a recession does come, it \u201ccould actually be a lot more severe than people think,\u201d according to David Wolf, part of the asset allocation team at Fidelity Investments Canada.\u201cThe reason for that is it\u2019s most likely to come from abroad,\u201d Wolf said, adding that it could result in Canada\u2019s first credit-cycle retrenchment since the early 1990s.Wolf said he\u2019s underweight the Canadian dollar and expects to see a \u201cpretty significant depreciation in the currency\u201d over the medium to long term.\u201cCanada actually stands out for us as being one of the more vulnerable economies despite what looks like a pretty good environment right now,\u201d Wolf said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s real estate market seen in full recovery mode as sales and prices gain in September", "description": "Country's oil-producing regions the only ones showing any weakness", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canadas-real-estate-market-is-in-full-recovery-mode", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 15, 2019 11:06 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s realtors produced another strong month of sales and prices in September, with gains in most major markets in a sign of strength for the nation\u2019s housing market.The number of units sold rose 0.6 per cent last month, extending a recent jump in activity that have seen transactions rise 16 per cent from a year ago, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday.

Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million (US$1.48 million) for a 1,163 square foot three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000.\u201cThey\u2019re selling out like crazy,\u201d said Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. \u201cWe had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn\u2019t 100 per cent get what we wanted.\u201d \nConstruction costs have more of an impact on home prices than you think\nToronto home prices jump most in 21 months, bringing $805,500 benchmark close to record\nVancouver area home sales jump 46% in September in sign of more balanced market\nA spokeswoman for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch.Canada\u2019s housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about US$10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent in September from last year.In contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012. Sales have also declined over the past two years.We're having the best back-to-back month since 2017 \n \nNew regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018. Those appear to have been largely absorbed \u2014 aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labour market. That\u2019s put housing affordability front and centre in the federal election campaign.\u201cI worked 90 hours in one week,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real-estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. \u201cThe pre-sale market is on fire again but resale has picked up too: We\u2019re having the best back-to-back month since 2017.\u201dSupply PuzzleCanada\u2019s population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto\u2019s booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city\u2019s many universities and colleges.Supply is lagging demand with even the International Monetary Fund this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home.\u201cThe demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,\u201d said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at Greybrook Capital, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. \u201cWhen you couple those together, that\u2019s an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it\u2019s rental or housing.\u201dElection OutcomeBoth the Liberal and Conservative parties are promising to make home buying more affordable on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals.Though the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the RE/MAX broker, said.They really need to revisit that stress test \u2014 it's causing people a lot of stressDawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier \n \n\u201cNo one really knows what to expect: Who\u2019s going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules?

To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year.The federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what\u2019s needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "From housing prices to childcare to transit, Canadian voters are feeling tight on cash", "description": "Politicians are trying to turn financial anxiety into votes by promising tax cuts and other initiatives to make life more affordable", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/why-affordability-is-dominating-canadas-election-campaign", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wallet.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 4, 2019 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters.Though broad economic data show the nation\u2019s economy is humming along, Canadians are still feeling tight on cash. The worsening global outlook and unprecedented policy uncertainty are adding to the apprehension.Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with the leaders of smaller parties are seeking to parlay that stress into votes as the clock winds down on the Oct. 21 election, by promising a slew of tax cuts and other measures to make life more affordable for Canadians.\u201cPoliticians are putting their finger on something, some form of financial anxiety about rising costs, or concerns about future rising costs, or future standard of living,\u201d said Jennifer Robson, associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa. \nGimme shelter: Breaking down the housing promises on the campaign trail\nLiberals, Tories unveil tax plans with similar price tags but different benefits depending on your income\nBreaking down the parties\u2019 tax-cut pledges in an election that\u2019s evolved into a bidding war for votes\nHere\u2019s why consumers are feeling pinched.It\u2019s old news that owning a home in Canada\u2019s biggest cities has become an almost impossible goal for much of the middle class. Skyrocketing prices in recent years pushed potential buyers to the sidelines. New mortgage lending rules, so-called stress tests introduced by federal regulators in 2017, put ownership even further out of reach for many.Toronto and Vancouver are easily Canada\u2019s two main cities where residents are struggling to find an affordable place to live. The average selling price for a single family home in Vancouver was $1.51 million (US$1.13 million) in September, and $1.1 million in Toronto. Renting in those cities is no easy feat either as low vacancy rates have pushed up prices for accommodation.Elevated real estate prices are the main driver of the country\u2019s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. Buyers took out larger and larger mortgages as the housing market heated up, even as incomes failed to keep pace. As a result, household savings rates are hovering near the lowest in decades and the debt service ratio \u2014 which measures the share of disposable income paid toward principal and interest \u2014 climbed to a record in the second quarter.While overall price inflation in Canada has been relatively benign, shoppers have experienced sticker shock on many basics. Prices for fruits and vegetables jumped as much as 60 per cent in the past decade, according to Statistics Canada. Childcare and tuition costs rose upwards of 35 per cent and public transit prices ballooned by 50 per cent.To top it all off, wages after accounting for inflation have remained relatively flat, even as costs for rent and basic goods increased. A puzzle for many economists and policy makers is why unemployment is hovering near record lows, yet incomes are struggling to pick up.\u2018Arms Race\u2019The financial pressure on Canadians isn\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon, with the worldwide economic outlook dimming. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to 3.2 per cent. A rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009. Adding to the tension, many workers are worried about robots displacing jobs and the financial impact of an aging population.\u201cThat\u2019s the emotional side of this issue that doesn\u2019t show up in any CPI index or economic data,\u201d said David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus Data. \u201cIt\u2019s in the head and the parties are clearly recognizing that emotional side is important. It\u2019s like an arms race right now in Canada to offer up who can save us the most money.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home prices jump most in 21 months, bringing $805,500 benchmark close to record", "description": "Sales surge 22%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-posts-biggest-price-gain-in-21-months", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 3, 2019 8:34 AM EDT", "content": "The Toronto housing market continued to rebound in September, with prices rising the most in 21 months, bringing the cost of a typical home close to the record high set in 2017.The benchmark price across all types of homes rose 5.2 per cent from a year earlier to $805,500, the highest annual rate of growth since December 2017.

Plus, Toronto developers face much higher charges for things such as building-permit fees or development charges to recover infrastructure costs that end up getting passed onto the home-buyer, the report said.Altus\u2019 report was conducted for the Building Industry and Land Development Association, which represents more than 1,500 companies across land development, home-building and the renovation industry in the Toronto region.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Paula Sambo", "title": "Don't-pay-til-you-die reverse mortgages are booming in Canada as seniors binge on debt", "description": "Already carrying debt, many seniors can't downsize because they can't afford high rents, so turn to reverse mortgages for a new source of income", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/dont-pay-til-you-die-reverse-mortgages-are-booming-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/reverse-mortgage.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 16, 2019 9:18 AM EDT", "content": "Reverse mortgages are surging in Canada as more older people join the country\u2019s debt bandwagon.If you\u2019re 55 or older, you can borrow as much as 55 per cent of the value of your home. Principal and compound interest don\u2019t have to be paid back until you sell the home or die. To keep the loan in good standing, homeowners only need to pay property tax and insurance, and maintain the home in good repair.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been in this market for 18 months, but applications are jumping,\u201d and have tripled over the past year, Andrew Moor, chief executive officer at Equitable Group Inc., said in an interview. The company, which operates Equitable Bank, sees the reverse mortgage sector expanding by about 25 per cent a year. \u201cCanadians are getting older and there is an opportunity there.\u201d \nMaking the case for the reverse mortgage as a retirement planning option\nSorry kids, Canadian seniors are ready to blow your inheritance\nRetiring with a mortgage? Why you might want to think twice about that\nOutstanding balances on reverse mortgages have more than doubled in less than four years to $3.12 billion (US$2.37 billion), excluding foreign currency amounts, according to June data from the country\u2019s banking regulator. Although they represent less than one percentage point of the $1.2 trillion of residential mortgages issued by chartered banks, they\u2019re growing at a much faster pace. Reverse mortgages rose 22 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier, versus 4.8 per cent for the total market.The fact that these niche products are growing so quickly offers a glimpse into how some seniors are becoming part of Canada\u2019s new debt reality. After a decades-long housing boom, the nation has the highest household debt load in the Group of Seven, one reason Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz may be reluctant to join the global monetary-policy easing trend.More seniors are entering retirement with debt and the cost of rent has shot up in many cities, making downsizing difficult amid hot real estate markets. Reverse mortgages offer a new source of income.Canada\u2019s big five banks have so far shied away from the product. Only two lenders offer them in Canada. HomeEquity Bank, whose reverse mortgage has been on the market for 30 years, dominates the space with $3.11 billion on its books. Equitable Bank, a relatively new player, has $10.1 million. Shares in parent Equitable Group have surged 75 per cent to a record this year.Critics say reverse mortgages are a high-cost solution that should only be used as a last resort.\u201cWhen they think of their cash flow, they\u2019re not going to get kicked out of their house, but in reality, it really has the ability to erode the asset of the borrower,\u201d Shawn Stillman, a broker at Mortgage Outlet, said by phone from Toronto.Higher RatesInterest rates are typically much higher than those for conventional mortgages. For example, HomeEquity Bank and Equitable Bank charge 5.74 per cent for a five-year fixed mortgage. Conventional five-year fixed mortgages are currently being offered online for as low as 2.4 per cent.Atul Chandra, chief financial officer at HomeEquity Bank, said the higher rates are justified because the lender doesn\u2019t receive any payments over the course of the loan.\u201cOur time horizon for getting the cash is much longer, and generally the longer you wait for your cash to come back to you, the more you need to charge,\u201d Chandra said in a telephone interview.Most DelinquentExecutives at HomeEquity Bank and Equitable say they are focusing on educating people about reverse mortgages to avoid mistakes that were made in the U.S. during the housing crisis \u2014 including aggressive sales tactics.While delinquency rates on regular mortgages are still low for seniors, they were the highest among all age groups in the first quarter, at 0.36 per cent, according to data from the federal housing agency. The 65-plus demographic took over as the most delinquent group at the end of 2015. For non-mortgage debt, delinquency rates in the 65-plus category have seen the biggest increases over the past several quarters, Equifax data show.Reverse mortgages aren\u2019t included in typical delinquency rate measures \u2014 borrowers can\u2019t be late on payments because there are no payments \u2014 but they can be in default if they fail to pay taxes or insurance, or let the home fall into disrepair. However default rates for reverse mortgages have remained stable, even with the strong growth in volumes, said HomeEquity\u2019s Chandra.According to a scenario provided by HomeEquity Bank, a borrower who took out a reverse mortgage of $150,000 at an interest rate of 5.74 per cent would owe $199,058 five years later. A home worth $750,000 when the reverse mortgage was taken out would be worth $869,456 five years later, assuming 3 per cent annual home price appreciation, meaning total equity would have grown by about $70,000.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello and Ashley Robinson", "title": "Founded in 1670 to trade furs, Hudson's Bay chases relevance in millennial shopper era", "description": "With millennials' penchant for shopping online or going directly to brands, the Bay has yet to offer something customers can't find somewhere else", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/founded-in-1670-to-trade-furs-hudsons-bay-chases-relevance?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 6, 2019 11:20 AM EDT", "content": "When Sears Canada announced it was closing all of its stores in 2017, Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. saw an opportunity: HBC\u2019s Canadian department store chain would swoop in and snatch Sears\u2019s customers. Managers gradually added mid-price apparel to stores from Nova Scotia to British Columbia and waited for sales to take off.The plan worked at first. But then the Bay \u2014 as the Canadian division is popularly known \u2014 started losing fashionistas in cities like Montreal and Toronto. The numbers tell the story: Comparable sales \u2014an industry benchmark the retailer recently resumed sharing after five years \u2014 fell for the past two quarters.HBC Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes says the strategy was ill-considered. \u201cWe have 53 stores that are in the same mall location with a Sears and we knew the stores were closing and those customers are looking for lower price points,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately we took that strategy too far\u201d to all\u00a089 stores. \nNot a \u2018clean exit\u2019: Hudson\u2019s Bay sells historic Lord & Taylor for $133 million\nCatalyst adds to stake in HBC as battle over retailer\u2019s fate heats up\nHudson\u2019s Bay chairman\u2019s buyout bid pits retail against real estate\nFoulkes, recruited last year from CVS Health Corp. to help turn around Hudson\u2019s Bay, has since rectified the problem. She has also been closing stores and selling assets \u2014 most recently New York\u2019s Lord & Taylor \u2014 to put the company on more solid financial footing. Now she can focus on the two remaining \u201ccrown jewels\u201d in her portfolio: Saks Fifth Avenue and the Bay.Luxury-focused Saks has been the star of late,\u00a0selling more at full price and connecting online shoppers to store sales staff for advice. The Bay, which gave the company its name, is having a harder time as a mid-range department store, a corner of retail that\u2019s particularly vulnerable to the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.It doesn\u2019t help that Foulkes is dealing with internal distractions. The Bay\u2019s last president stepped down six months ago and hasn\u2019t yet been replaced. Meanwhile, plans by Chairman Richard Baker to take HBC private and ease investor pressure for a quick turnaround is being resisted by some shareholders who consider his US$1.31-billion valuation of the company too low. The shares have gained since Baker\u2019s June 10 offer but are down about 40 per cent from five years ago.And while Foulkes\u00a0is correcting\u00a0merchandising\u00a0mistakes, improving service and making the e-commerce experience smoother,\u00a0experts say the Bay\u00a0has deeper issues. With millennial shoppers keener to buy online or directly from brands, the retailer has yet to offer something they can\u2019t find somewhere else and risks drifting into irrelevance.\n\nPedestrians walk by Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. flagship store in Toronto.\n\nCole Burston/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cOverall the department-store sector is in decline and when you look at the Bay there isn\u2019t a lot in its current form that really differentiates it,\u201d says Bruce Winder, co-founder & partner at the Retail Advisors Network in Toronto. \u201cWhy would you shop at the Bay? That\u2019s what they have to answer.\u201dFor much of the 20th century, Canadians had plenty of reasons to shop at the Bay,\u00a0a storied company whose 349-year history is deeply entwined with that of the\u00a0nation. The department store\u2019s\u00a0epic beginnings as a fur trader founded by two French adventurers and their influential British backers have inspired Hollywood movies, including the 1941 historical drama \u201cHudson\u2019s Bay,\u201d which starred a young Vincent Price\u00a0among others.Why would you shop at the Bay? That's what they have to answer Bruce Winder, co-founder & partner at the Retail Advisors Network \n \nThe company\u2019s subsequent transformation into a full-fledged merchant paralleled\u00a0the birth of Western cities like Winnipeg and Edmonton. And\u00a0its coast-to-coast presence was built buying other household names in retail. Half of the country\u2019s population lives within 10 miles of the Bay.The original stores, situated on fashionable downtown avenues, were imposing temples to consumption. The Winnipeg downtown location, which opened in 1926, boasted a fur storage vault kept at a constant 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2.22 degrees Celsius) and capable of housing 12,000 garments. The store catered to shoppers of the day with a beauty parlour, post office and library. Later, management opened an auditorium with an orchestra. Like its American counterparts, Hudson\u2019s Bay operated restaurants with names like the Jolly Canuck and the Paddlewheel.\n\nThe Bay store in downtown Winnipeg in 2010.\n\nBrian Donogh/Winnipeg Sun/QMI Agency\n\nCEO Foulkes believes the Bay retains much of its cachet. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely not a brand in the United States that has the connection that the Bay does with its customers,\u201d she says. That legacy comes at a cost, including 15.7 million square feet of physical space to maintain \u2014 three times that of Saks. With cash short, the company is renovating its urban, flagship stores.The Winnipeg store echoes the company\u2019s deterioration. From a distance, the Beaux Arts building remains impressive but\u00a0the wear and tear becomes obvious close up: the brass doors are weathered, the floor tiles peeling, and an escalator to the second floor is out of service.\u00a0The Bay now occupies just two of the six floors of a former flagship that once sprawled over 655,755 square feet.\u201cIt used to be more of a destination,\u201d says Ellen Frovich, a 60-year-old customer who remembers making the trip downtown to watch window displays for Christmas as a teenager. Frovich, who was at the store browsing one\u00a0afternoon in July, says she continues shopping there for the variety and quality of clothing.But the Bay must appeal to younger shoppers, too. A decade ago, it dusted off its image under then president Bonnie Brooks \u2014 now CEO of women retailer Chico\u2019s FAS Inc. \u2014 who overhauled women\u2019s apparel and accessories to cater to fashionistas.While that gave the company focus, simply selling products no longer suffices in an age where brands like Millennial-magnet Frank and Oak, athletic wear Lole or parka maker Canada Goose develop a direct relationship with customers. The Bay could carve out a new role, says David Zietsma, a senior vice president at Toronto-based consultancy Jackman Reinvents, by helping clients discover and learn about brands.\n\nHudson\u2019s bay flagship store in Toronto.\n\nCole Burston/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThere are definitely consumers out there that want more than just a price-focused, convenience-focused purchase but don\u2019t have the confidence to go directly to fashion brands, don\u2019t know how to discover,\u201d says Zietsma, a former Sears executive who once consulted for the Bay. They\u2019re asking: \u201cHelp me find what works for me.\u201dThe Bay has another problem, according to Robert Soroka, a business professor at Concordia University in Montreal. While it has\u00a0positioned itself as a fashion house of sorts, the retailer constantly advertises discounts and promotions, sending a muddled message to customers about what kind of retailer it exactly is. Selling cheaper products to appeal to Sears shoppers confused shoppers even more.The company has cut out 300 home and apparel brands and added 100 new ones. It has been\u00a0experimenting\u00a0with popups, including with FAO Schwarz last holiday season. And two floors of the Bay\u2019s flagship store in Toronto will be converted into WeWork co-working space, bringing more millennials through the doors.Retail Advisors Network\u2019s Winder has a more drastic suggestion: Draw on the Bay\u2019s history and go full Canadiana.While the Bay already carries a selection of signature heritage products, such as a wool point blanket first sold in the late 1700s, he says the chain could build stores around such merchandise.\u00a0\u201cIt has huge history and it has a huge pedigree and a story to tell,\u201d he says. \u201cShrink it and make it more profitable, redefine it, and then start to grow it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "It's getting harder for the Bank of Canada to ignore the trade war", "description": "In a policy statement due at 10 a.m., economists expect Poloz to underline his unease with the global trade outlook and signal a willingness to cut rates", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-interest-rate-decision-day-trade-war?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 4, 2019 7:20 AM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada is expected to open the door further to interest rate cuts at a decision Wednesday, amid worries U.S.-China tensions will curb a relatively robust expansion at home.In a policy statement due at 10 a.m. that\u2019s likely to keep benchmark rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent for now, economists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will underline his unease with the global trade outlook and signal a greater willingness to join the Federal Reserve and other central banks in cutting borrowing costs, as early as next month.The case for cheaper money isn\u2019t as compelling in Canada as it is elsewhere.

Wednesday\u2019s decision is a statement-only affair. The next day, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will give a speech in Halifax to provide more details on the central bank\u2019s deliberations around the decision. \nExpect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by the end of the year: David Rosenberg\nCanada, U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand only major bond markets now without negative rates \u2014 if they go, we\u2019re in trouble\nLook for a dovish Bank of Canada next week \u2014 with cuts coming soon, economists say\nSwaps trading suggests investors are fully pricing in a cut by December, with strong odds of a second by this time next year. Odds for a rate cut on Wednesday are less than 10 per cent.Even two cuts over the next 12 months would still leave Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies \u2014 raising the question of whether the domestic outlook truly justifies the northern nation\u2019s outlier status.While Canada\u2019s expansion is hardly remarkable, it stands out by virtue of having largely weathered the recent global slowdown. After a sluggish start to the year, growth in Canada accelerated to a strong 3.7 per cent annualized pace in the second quarter, giving it a very decent 2.1 per cent performance for the first half.Canada\u2019s housing market, meanwhile, is recovering; inflation is at target; and wage gains are accelerating. The Canadian data are hardly screaming rate cut.Nor are forecasts overly gloomy.Economists, including those at the central bank, continue to see growth averaging more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, which outside of the U.S. is as good as it gets in the Group of Seven.Of course, the Bank of Canada could mark down its forecasts for exports and investment, and the second-quarter GDP numbers also raised concerns about the underlying strength of consumption. But without a global recession, the base case will continue to call for half-decent growth, tempering the need for rate cuts.Risk ManagementYet, the one thing Poloz has practiced as governor is a reluctance to put too much weight on base case projections. He adopted a risk management framework in 2013 \u2014 well before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2014 that essentially moved the focus away from pinpoint forecasts to thinking about what could produce unexpected deviations. It\u2019s a play-it-safe strategy.When conditions were calling for rates to go up, risk management took the form of hyper data dependency. Policy makers were worried that more expensive credit could trigger an unwanted downturn so they were willing to go slow with hikes, waiting for the data to reaffirm their analysis.Now, with downside risks at the forefront and conditions suggesting cuts are in order, waiting may no longer be the best type of risk management strategy. Which is why Poloz, in the middle of the oil price shock in 2015, cut interest rates at the time. He called it an insurance cut, much like Powell\u2019s rationale for the Fed\u2019s last move.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Paula Sambo", "title": "Ottawa\u2019s homebuyer plan not a big help in Canada\u2019s pricey markets", "description": "The maximum purchase price of $565,000 puts many markets out of reach", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/trudeaus-homebuyer-plan-offers-little-solace-in-canadas-pricey-markets?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 3, 2019 10:16 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants to make housing more affordable for first-time buyers.

Trudeau\u2019s government expects the program will be used by 100,000 buyers, but brokers and analysts are skeptical that it will have much traction in the areas that need it most. \nFirst-time home buyers could save $286 a month on mortgage payments under new federal program\nCondos, the \u2018future of our communities,\u2019 now cost more per square foot than a detached home\nSeven reasons Canada\u2019s housing market is stronger than it looks\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very narrowly-focused program,\u201d Royal LePage President Phil Soper said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a big enough slot of the market to move it.\u201dWhile there are people who will benefit, the initiative is unlikely to help those looking in Toronto or Vancouver, where the average price of a home in July was $826,165 and $982,427, respectively.Income RequirementThe program is available to buyers with annual household earnings of $120,000 or less, and the mortgage-to-income ratio can\u2019t be more than four times the household income. Under those conditions, the maximum purchase price allowed is about $565,000.That puts markets such as Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, Greater Vancouver and Victoria out of reach of the average buyer, according to real estate website Zoocasa. Cities where home-shoppers would have more luck include Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, Zoocasa said.The program, called the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, also will encourage construction to help ease the country\u2019s housing-supply shortage, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.\u201cDespite the income and borrowing limits, we are confident this program can work in all markets, including Vancouver and Toronto,\u201d Audrey-Anne Coulombe, a spokeswoman for CMHC, said in an email. The average prices in those cities \u201care not the same as starter-home prices. In the first quarter, 32 per cent of units sold in Toronto and 20 per cent in Vancouver were under $499,000.\u201dStill, the effort may result in fewer than 5,000 purchases a year, according to a report by Mortgage Professionals Canada. Buyers\u2019 resistance to give up equity in their homes and the requirement for mortgage insurance will be a substantial impediment, said Will Dunning, chief economist for the group.\u201cThe government says it wants to make homeownership more affordable and accessible, but its actions say otherwise,\u201d he said.

Meanwhile, its ratio of compensation to revenue was at 37.9 per cent in the quarter, higher than the annual average over the past two years.The bank also is taking steps to reduce risks in its trading book. The average value at risk, a probabilistic measure of potential losses in a daily trading session, decreased to $23 million from $34 million at the end of April due to reduction of fixed-income inventories in the second quarter and lower market volatility in the first half of the year, a bank official said by email.RBC is further paring risks as more than US$16.1 trillion of bonds trade with a negative yield, while stock prices remain fairly lofty, meaning investors have to decide which market is correctly assessing economic and geopolitical developments. Inverted government yield curves in several developed economies suggest the chances of recession are increasing, even as investors keep bidding for new corporate bonds at historically low coupons.While investment-banking fees are down this year, Royal Bank \u201chas a strong investment-banking pipeline,\u201d including a number of \u201cmarquee deals,\u201d Bolger said.

Daal said Toronto is likely in the middle of its office-building cycle with strong growth ahead.Vancouver-based QuadReal plans to take down the South and East towers of the 2 million square foot Commerce Court complex, which together have 18 floors. Those were part of a three-building addition in the 1970s designed by architect I.M.

It includes a vaulted gold-coffered ceiling and classic Art-Deco design and will be incorporated into the makeover.CIBC MoveThe plan is in early stages and still needs city approval. If successful, occupancy could be as early as 2025, Daal said.CIBC, which currently takes up about 650,000 square feet at Commerce Court, is relocating its headquarters to two new office towers on the south side of Bay St. It\u2019s unclear how much space the bank will require in Commerce Court after the move.\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that there\u2019s a full-exit here, but it\u2019s going to be a reduced scale with significant retail presence so we\u2019re working through that as we speak,\u201d Daal said in the interview. \u201cThe corner of King and Bay is a very difficult corner to have real estate on so once you have it you don\u2019t want to give it up.\u201dCIBC declined to comment on its plans regarding Commerce Court as details are still being finalized, a representative said in an email.Like many of its peers, QuadReal is looking to expand its real estate portfolio, which has more than $37 billion (US$28 billion) worth of assets.

The insurer said in July that it would seek to gauge interest in the Canadian mortgage insurance unit after lack of \u201cany substantive progress\u201d on talks with regulators in that country for the China Oceanwide deal.Brookfield plans to fund about US$700 million of the purchase on its own and for some of its institutional partners to co-invest alongside it for the rest.

It also still needs clearance in China for currency conversion, according to the statement Tuesday.The sale of the Canadian subsidiary comes at a sensitive time for Canadian-Chinese relations. The government is currently studying whether to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from its 5G networks. U.S. charges late last year against the Chinese telco saw its chief financial officer detained in Vancouver at the request of the U.S. Since then, Beijing has detained two Canadians, halted imports of canola and is now turning away meat shipments from Canada.Home SalesGenworth MI Canada competes with Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Co. in providing mortgage insurance, alongside the federal government\u2019s Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. In Canada, homebuyers with less than a 20 per cent downpayment are required to get their mortgage insured through one of the three companies.Alternative lenders have been reaping the benefits of Canada\u2019s tighter mortgage regulations as homebuyers seek financing outside of the big banks in wake of new rules imposed last year. And home prices in big cities have remained lofty. Sales in the city of Toronto have been rebounding all summer from a slump earlier this year as housing supply remains limited, driving prices higher for most segments.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "Canfor soars 70% on billionaire Jim Pattison\u2019s bid to take it private", "description": "Already owns about 51 per cent of Canfor's shares", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/great-pacific-offers-to-take-canfor-corp-private-at-c16-a-share", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/jim-pattison.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 12, 2019 1:48 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison \u2014 whose conglomerate owns businesses including supermarkets, fisheries and billboards \u2014 offered to take lumber producer Canfor Corp. private for about $981.6 million.Pattison\u2019s Great Pacific Capital Corp., which already owns 51 per cent of Canfor, proposed on Sunday to buy out the remaining shares for $16 apiece, an 82 per cent premium to the stock\u2019s closing price on Friday.

That\u2019s counter to the expectation of markets, where forward rates point to some easing over the same period.The surprising robustness of the domestic economy may be keeping the bulk of analysts in the more hawkish camp. As global trade uncertainty mounts, key Canadian indicators continue to beat expectations \u2014 including back-to-back trade surpluses \u2014 with growth in the second quarter tracking faster than expected. \nCanada loses 24,200 jobs in July, pushing unemployment rate higher\nCanadian housing starts decline 9.6% in July on multi-unit drop\nWhy strategists are so bullish on Canadian stocks, even in the midst of a trade war\n\u201cPoloz will need to see a substantial weakening in domestic data before the bank changes its stance,\u201d Dominique Lapointe, an economist at Laurentian Bank, said by phone from Montreal. \u201cThe extent to which global tensions translate into lower business investment and exports in Canada has yet to be seen.\u201dOf the 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, nine expect the Bank of Canada to remain on hold to the end of 2020. Domestic banks are among the more optimistic \u2014 with Toronto Dominion, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, National Bank and Laurentian expecting Poloz to hold well into next year.But not all are convinced, with six analysts predicting at least one cut amid escalating U.S.-China trade tension that is raising doubts about the global growth outlook, and which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week.Trade and investment are most at risk for Canada. While underlying export strength is at its strongest since 2015, evidence of slowing global demand is mounting. Inventory-to-sales ratios are at recession-era highs in both the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, and leading indicators for Canadian exporters are deteriorating. Signs are also emerging that the nation\u2019s red-hot labor market is cooling off.Royal Bank of Canada expects Poloz to cut rates in the first quarter of next year, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce moving their call ahead to that same period earlier this week. Capital Economics, meanwhile, expects the central bank to lower its benchmark to 1 per cent by the end of 2020.Yet, there are plenty of arguments in favour of a hold. Canada\u2019s economy in the second quarter probably grew at a faster pace than the 2.3 per cent forecast by the Bank of Canada in its July monetary policy report. Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms and the inflation rate is bang-on the central bank\u2019s target.Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, sees another good reason for Poloz and his colleagues to buck the global easing trend. \u201cDo they want to go back to 2015 where they cut rates and stoked a big acceleration in credit and home prices? That\u2019s pretty fresh in their minds,\u201d Kavcic said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they want to go there right now.\u201dA re-acceleration in housing activity in many Canadian cities and some of the strongest wage growth in a decade, even as headline employment slows down, also has the potential to underpin consumption in the second half.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Developers can't get enough of Canada's new loans to build rental housing", "description": "Demand has been so hot for the low-cost CMHC loans that the government plans to increase the program to almost $14 billion over the next nine years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/developers-cant-get-enough-of-canadas-new-loans-to-build-rental-housing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 9, 2019 9:57 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ramped up loans to boost rental housing in Canada and developers are snapping them up.Demand has been so hot for the low-cost loans from Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. that the government plans to increase the program to almost $14 billion (US$11 billion) over the next nine years.

He wears a pork pie hat, favours fleece over pinstripes and is easy to tear up when talking about local \u201cempowerment.\u201dHe\u2019s also president of The Daniels Corp., one of Canada\u2019s biggest developers.The closely held firm has built about 30,000 homes around Toronto, a quarter of which were sold below-market prices. It\u2019s also a lead developer in the transformation of Regent Park, one of North America\u2019s biggest social-housing makeovers \u2014 and the subject of Cohen\u2019s musicals.Being an affordable housing advocate and a big-time developer may not be a contradiction for Cohen. but he said governments are going to have to nudge more companies into action to tackle the growing affordability crisis.\u201cWithout the government engagement, the private sector is not going to create affordable housing,\u201d said the 68 year old in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \nMore renting and less home ownership won\u2019t solve the housing affordability problem\nComplain all you want, but the rental housing market needs condo investors\nCanada gets first big taste of co-living rentals trend with tower featuring fully furnished apartments, rooftop yoga\nCities from Sydney to San Francisco are grappling with how to do just that after years of relentless price gains. Berlin plans to freeze rents for five years. And in San Francisco, tech giants are trying to reverse some of the housing inflation their wages have helped create: Google has said it would spend US$1 billion over the next 10 years repurposing its own land for residential use and incentivising developers to build affordable housing.Toronto is no exception. Home home prices surged 60 per cent in the five years through June and the vacancy rate for rentals is hovering near 1 per cent. Mayor John Tory has pledged to create 40,000 affordable rental units in the next 12 years and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing a $55 billion (US$41 billion) 10-year program promising 125,000 new homes.Tackling supply is key and that means developers have to be at the table, said Cohen, who runs the day-to-day operations of Daniels, which has averaged annual revenue of about $200 million in its last two fiscal years. The company was founded in 1983 by John H. Daniels, former chairman and chief executive officer of Cadillac Fairview, now owned by the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board.\u201cDevelopers are creative, they will find a way to work within the system,\u201d Cohen said. Companies are becoming sensitized to the fact that affordability is becoming important, even if it might not be as \u201ccrazy profitable.\u201dCreating AlliesCohen reels off a few policies that could work: intentional disposition of land, where governments sell or lease public land to developers on the condition they build affordable units; inclusionary zoning which requires developments to include affordable units; and down-payment assistance for first-time buyers \u2014 now part of the federal government\u2019s platform.\u201cYou want to create an environment where developers can not only live with but hopefully even become comfortable with the regulations because ultimately you want them to be your allies,\u201d Alan Mallach, a senior fellow at Washington-based Center for Community Progress, said.Creating allies has been Cohen\u2019s playbook since 1973 when he was working for the YMCA in Montreal. Tenants in the dingy complex that housed his office came in waving eviction notices. The landlord wanted to demolish the site and build condos \u2014 they had 30 days to vacate.\u201cI saw how vulnerable people are and how close to the margins people can be,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, I was a community-development worker turned shit-disturber activist overnight.\u201dTime WarpJustin Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister and had just created a national housing plan that offered funding for co-operatives to buy or lease land. It was the ammunition Cohen needed: he marched 300 tenants to city hall to protest the demolition. Under the media glare, he negotiated with the landlord to build condos on half the land, and formed the co-op on the other. It had a 99-year lease and is still operating today.Fast-forward nearly 50 years and Daniels is allying with the city of Toronto to pull off the massive renovation of Regent Park, a mix of subsidized and market-rate rentals and homes for purchase. After almost 15 years and a more than $1 billion investment from Daniels and the city, the 69-acre site barely resembles the crime-pocked neighbourhood it was. Decrepit apartment blocks constructed in the 1940s and 1950s have been razed and replaced by modern new buildings. Once a no-go area for big business, brands such as Royal Bank of Canada, have moved in.\n\nA view of old versus new Regent Park housing in Toronto.\n\nJack Boland/Toronto Sun/Postmedia Network files\n\nDaniels worked with Toronto Community Housing to build 3,558 units so far, of which about 30 per cent are considered affordable. Almost 2,000 more units are under construction. About half the roughly 2,083 people in social housing have a new home in the development. Others are waiting, have deferred or decided to move out.First RungDaniels invested its own capital alongside the city in the first two phases, sharing profits generated from condo sales. In the third phase, it bought the land from the city to develop several condo buildings, a seniors residence and a rental building. Toronto Community Housing owns the social and affordable rental units.Daniels is now up against Tridel Builders Inc. and Capital Developments on the final two phases of the project. Other developers are also expanding further into affordable housing.We're learning as we goMitchell Cohen \n \n\u201cWe built social, affordable housing right beside market housing, and we did it because we wanted to demonstrate that people were still going to buy and our land values were not eroded,\u201d he said.That bet has paid off. Townhouses that sold for $500,000 when the development first began, have gone for as much as $1.5 million. Purchasers can access various government-backed programs to get\u00a0 on the first rung of home-ownership and rents in the social-housing unit are geared to income. But they\u2019re close to $2,000 elsewhere in the development, nearing the downtown average, according to a broker in the area.Tension ArisesThe gentrification is creating some tension between tenants who have lived in the community their whole lives and owners of the shiny new condominiums.\u201cIt\u2019s not equal,\u201d said Kendell Campbell, 29, who\u2019s lived in Regent Park since 1993 and now lives in one of the market-rent apartments. He points to the lush green balconies of the condos versus the sparser ones of the social-housing units.Cohen\u2019s fifth iteration of a musical about the revitalization will address some of that tension.\u201cWe\u2019re learning as we go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been figuring this out day by day.\u201dFostering community spirit is as important as delivering the housing, Cohen said. When he came across a group of Bangladeshi women in the neighbourhood who missed gathering to sew he commissioned them to make a massive quilt to hang in the lobby of one of the new condominiums.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just buildings,\u201d said Cohen, choking up as remembered the smiles on the women\u2019s faces the day it was unveiled. \u201cThis is about empowerment and every single part of what we are doing there is about creating capacity in the local neighbourhood.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home sales jump 24%, prices climb amid housing supply crunch", "description": "The benchmark price rose 4.4 per cent to $800,900, largely driven by gains in the condo segment", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/toronto-home-sales-soar-prices-climb-amid-housing-supply-crunch?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 6, 2019 3:10 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales and prices continued to move higher in July amid tight supply.Sales in Canada\u2019s biggest city jumped 24 per cent to 8,595 from the same period last year, the Toronto Real Estate Board said in a report Tuesday.

He argues lower interest rates, an accelerating housing market, a solid labour market, record high stocks and overall decent investment returns will support consumption.\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see a pick up in big ticket items again,\u201d Demers said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not great because we\u2019re relying on debt, but in terms of dynamics, it looks more positive over the next 12 to 18 months in an environment where rates are going down, and not up.\u201d \nDelinquency rates climb to two-year high as Canadian credit card balances grow\nCanadians\u2019 insolvency problems might not be as bad as everyone thinks, C.D. Howe says\nWith the Bank of Canada holding interest rates \u2026 just how vulnerable are Canadians to debt?\nHome sales skidded to their lowest since 2012 last year as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market. Automobile sales also suffered in Canada, with 2018 marking the first annual drop since the last recession. The malaise has been reflected in the pace of household credit growth, which has slowed to a crawl: It rose just 3.4 per cent in May, the weakest annual pace since 1983.But the Canadian housing market \u2014 east of Manitoba, at least \u2014 is already showing signs of shaking off that weakness. Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show prices through June in the Greater Toronto Area are 3 per cent higher on a six-month average basis, while Ottawa and Montreal have seen even faster gains, up 7.6 per cent and and 6.4 per cent respectively. In addition, the 11.5 per cent increase in resale volumes in the GTA signals \u201cvery strong,\u201d demand, Demers said.\u201cThe soft landing is behind us,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you think about the GTA and Canada in general, we\u2019re looking more at a re-acceleration.\u201dThe high household debt level \u201cremains a big concern and a headwind to the Canadian dollar,\u201d said Demers, and without a strong capital spending boom, the lingering debt burden will mean it\u2019s tough to \u201coutperform trend growth\u201d once rates eventually move higher, constraining disposable income.In the shorter term, however, Demers is more bullish on Canada, partly because the country\u2019s equity market may be less exposed to trade-war uncertainty. He sees car sales stabilizing this summer, and the housing market in central Canada continuing to accelerate. Gross domestic product for May on Wednesday will give an indication of whether the country\u2019s economic upswing remains on track.\u201cThe pace of credit growth should pick up in the second half of this year,\u201d as more \u201ctrend-like\u201d household spending returns, Demers said. \u201cThis removes a lot of the downside risks regarding households we saw earlier this year.\u201dConsumer confidence highest in a year and a half \n \nOne more reason to believe big-ticket spending is set for a rebound is the recent surge in consumer confidence measures, which are closely tied to the state of the economy and moves in stock markets. The Bloomberg Nanos economic mood index reached 59.06 this month, the highest level in a year and a half.

But with the U.S. fiscal outlook darkening amid the risk that a softer housing market could hurt consumer sentiment in the world\u2019s biggest economy, \u201cwe continue to think that there are more gains in the Canadian dollar,\u201d said Weniger, director of asset allocation at the money manager.While Canada\u2019s economy has been dealing with overheated real estate markets such as in Vancouver, in the U.S., some West Coast markets still may have to adjust, he said. That could undermine U.S. consumer sentiment and possibly strengthen expectations for more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts. There are already signs that U.S. home buyers are less likely to face a bidding war.\u201cIt could portend many things that could hinder the greenback relative to CAD, such as the Fed needing to go easier,\u201d or U.S. President Donald Trump talking down the dollar amid adverse data on the housing front, Weniger said in an interview in Toronto last week. His firm, which oversees about $60 billion, is based in New York.Some ConcernThe loonie has advanced 4 per cent this year to around 76.30 U.S. cents. The median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for it to end the year at 76.92. Some of Canada\u2019s top banks are signalling concern about the currency\u2019s near-term outlook. They\u2019re worried it could stumble if Canadian economic data fail to sustain recent strong results amid trade friction.For Weniger, the path of the U.S. budget deficit strengthens his view that the loonie will outpace the dollar. He looks at candidates\u2019 promises as the 2020 U.S. presidential election approaches and sees little prospect of halting the fiscal deterioration. According to people briefed on the discussions, Congress and the White House are on the brink of a spending and debt-limit deal that could push the annual budget gap over US$1 trillion next year.\u201cThe U.S. budget is one of those metrics that doesn\u2019t matter until it matters,\u201d Weniger said.What\u2019s striking for him is that the loonie has rallied this year even as analysts have been cautious about its potential.\u201cIf you call 80 cents that makes you some of sort of wild bull,\u201d said Weniger, who doesn\u2019t publish estimates for the Canadian dollar. \u201cThat is a testament to how much in-the-basement sentiment has been.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier", "title": "Surprise slump in retail sales bolsters case that Bank of Canada would follow Fed in rate cut", "description": "Food sales down 2%, booze and clothing sales down 2.7%", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/canada-retail-trade-unexpectedly-dips-as-bad-weather-hits-food-drink-sales", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/liquor.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 19, 2019 1:27 PM EDT", "content": "Canadians retailers reported an unexpected decline in sales as consumers cut back on purchases of groceries, alcohol and clothing.Sales fell 0.1 per cent in May, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa, versus economist expectations for a 0.3 per cent increase.

The statistics agency also noted its \u201ctrading-day adjustment,\u201d where it accounts for the number of heavier shopping days in a calendar month, may have skewed the May results to the downside.

While sales of detached homes surged 19 per cent from last year, they were the only segment to see prices drop on an average basis, falling 1.4 per cent.Toronto home sales have bounced back in recent months after slumping amid tighter mortgage-lending rules and higher interest rates in the past year.

Still, condo prices continued to rise overall, with the benchmark price up 7.5 per cent in June to $539,500 from the same month a year ago.Slight ReliefThe number of condos leased jumped 15 per cent in the second quarter to 9,749 from the same period last year, as listings grew by 29 per cent.Rents continued to rise but at a slower pace.

That pushed a lot of buyers into the cheaper condo segment, which saw prices jump as much as 11 per cent in the first quarter of last year.Rents Ease\u201cThe stress test is creating affordability challenges for first-time buyers plus single-family home prices haven\u2019t become more competitive and growth for larger suites is also starting to slow down,\u201d Hildebrand said. Price growth for smaller units is still well above average while growth for larger ones has fallen below average.The average price of a three-bedroom condo reached $800,000 in Toronto in the first quarter, higher than the combined average price of $727,000 for semi-attached, row and townhouses in May. In contrast, prices averaged below $500,000 in the first quarter for studios and one-bedroom units.Rent gains for Toronto condos have also been easing in the past few quarters and are expected to continue cooling amid a surge in completions of condo and purpose-built rental apartments, Hildebrand said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "Oxford Properties Group is planning one of Canada's biggest real estate projects in Toronto", "description": "Plans call for two office towers, of 58 and 48 stories, about 800 rental apartments across two buildings and 200,000 square feet for retail", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/oxford-properties-group-is-planning-one-of-canadas-biggest-real-estate-projects-in-toronto", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/union-park.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 26, 2019 9:47 AM EDT", "content": "Oxford Properties Group is planning a $3.5 billion (US$2.7 billion) development in downtown Toronto that would be one of Canada\u2019s biggest real estate projects.The property arm of pension fund OMERS aims to build a 4.3 million-square-foot, mixed-use complex on a 4-acre site that\u2019s just north of Toronto\u2019s Rogers Centre and CN Tower.

The Union Park site lies between the space-crunched financial core, and The Well, a mixed-use development that will be home to Shopify Inc. and hundreds of new residents.Toronto is in the midst of a construction boom. In addition to Oxford\u2019s project and The Well, which will have three million square-feet of retail, office and residential space, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. and Hines are developing CIBC SQUARE. That will comprise two commercial towers spanning 3 million square feet that will house offices for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as well as Microsoft Inc. Cadillac Fairview Corp. and Investment Management Corp. of Ontario are also developing 1.2 million-plus square feet of office and retail space.In a bid to attract global tech giants or other major tenants, Oxford has plans for 100,000-square-foot spaces that would be split between the office towers and connected by a common atrium, said Mark Cote, head of development. One company would be able to occupy the whole space.\u201cWe want to create a commercial campus opportunity for large office users,\u201d Cote said.About 18,000 people will work at Union Park, and the development itself could create 22,000 construction jobs, Oxford said.

Quebec and Saskatchewan also came to the market this week.National Bank of Canada, which sold $500 million deposit notes Monday, priced US$1 billion of three-year mortgage covered bonds, in the third sale of such securities out of Canada this week. The bonds were priced at 30 basis points over the mid-swaps rates.Smaller lender Laurentian Bank of Canada priced $300 million of three-year deposit notes at a 120-basis-point spread, three days after selling $339 million of securities pooling government-backed mortgages at an spread of 52 basis points. Earlier this week, at least six Canadian financial issuers priced deals.Non-financial companies including Keyera Corp. raised debt.

Three things united them: they were young, they wanted to do good and they were all staggeringly wealthy.The group was attending a joint course run by Harvard and the University of Zurich, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, called Impact Investing for the Next Generation. In this context, that generation means the heirs to some of capitalism\u2019s greatest fortunes. Participants had to pass an interview before paying up to US$12,000 for a week of classes in the U.S. and Switzerland, not including airfares and board. A more intensive related course costs US$58,000.The program has barely been advertised since its founding in 2015 and word is spread through old-money networks and among European royalty. Alumni include Chung Kyungsun, grandson of Hyundai Group\u2019s founder, and Antonis Schwarz, who came into his fortune aged 16 when the drugmaker his grandfather founded was sold for US$5 billion. \nMacKenzie Bezos takes Warren Buffett\u2019s pledge to give away more than half of her $37 billion windfall from divorce\nWall Street banks take on summer school: Investing 101 for rich kids\nWilliam Watson: Giving zillionaires below-zero tax rates could help us all \u2014 really!\nPayback for paying it forward: For companies, it\u2019s not charity anymore, it\u2019s community giving\nThe graduates represent a quiet insurgency among the world\u2019s wealthy millennials. As their peers march to protest climate change and inequality, these privileged few are arming themselves with the skills and arguments they need to convince their families \u2014 often against bankers\u2019 advice \u2014 to make more \u201cimpact investments\u201d that are designed to benefit society as well as turn a profit.\u201cIt gets the scions of the world\u2019s wealthiest families together to talk about impact investing, and I don\u2019t know a lot of programs like that,\u201d says Schwarz, 30, who established the Guerrilla Foundation to support activists and grassroots social movements. \u201cPeople go in not knowing much about the impact space and they come out as impact champions.\u201dThe push comes amid rising pressure on the world\u2019s wealthiest citizens to give more back. A widening gulf between haves and have-nots is helping drive populist movements around the globe. And while politicians dither over issues like climate change, fearful of votes, and corporations make charitable contributions with one eye on shareholder profits, high-net-worth individuals have the money and freedom to make rapid and influential investment decisions \u2014 they will have almost US$70 trillion at their disposal by 2021, according to Ernst & Young LLP.Asia is a prime example of both the potential upside and huge challenges facing young heirs trying to do good. While the region now holds one-third of global wealth, it contributes a much smaller portion of the total in impact investing, according to Abhilash Mudaliar, research director for the Global Impact Investing Network. Family offices in the region donate about 80 per cent less to philanthropy than their European and American peers, although that\u2019s partly because many Asian families give back to communities via more informal channels.I'm definitely someone who's benefiting from this (unequal) social structure. That's why I felt that I needed to do something about it.Chung Kyungsun, grandson of Hyundai Group founder \n \nHeirs like Chung are trying to change that. As an introverted child at an all-boys school, he was bullied for his love of books and video games and had little interest in joining the Hyundai family business. The more he read, the worse he felt about a world with a growing gap between rich and poor, where many had no access to basics such as healthcare. In South Korea, the blame for those inequalities was falling on the nation\u2019s family-run conglomerates \u2014 the chaebol.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m responsible for that, or that my family is responsible for it, but I\u2019m definitely someone who\u2019s benefiting from this social structure,\u201d Chung, 32, said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I felt that I needed to do something about it.\u201dEarly charity work for Chung\u2019s family foundation gave him a taste of positive change, but that came with its own set of expectations and limitations. So despite his parents\u2019 misgivings, he backed his own ideas, took the Harvard course and later co-founded Root Impact to launch co-working spaces for social ventures, offer financial grants for affordable housing and environmental programs that benefit children, women and people living in poverty.\n\nChung Kyungsun, co-founder and chief investment officer of Root Impact, begun with the help of his vast inheritance.\n\nDavid Williams / Bloomberg\n\n\u201cIn Asia especially, parents don\u2019t allow children to do their own thing, or if they do, it\u2019s with very limited funds,\u201d Chung said. \u201cThey feel very lonely because they feel like they\u2019re the crazy ones.\u201dRecruiting people like Chung to the sector is vital because the scale of the challenge is too great for government aid or philanthropy alone, said James Gifford, head of impact investing at UBS Group AG and co-founder of the Harvard course.\u201cThe heavy lifting of, say, pulling a billion people out of poverty has to be through sustainable capitalism,\u201d said Gifford, an Australian who worked as an environmental activist.Because this class of financing is designed to make money, the theory is that families and institutions can put in more cash because they\u2019ll eventually make it back. With some of Chung\u2019s impact investments coming good, his father is now a convert and looking to contribute more of the family\u2019s money.Gifford said working with the new generation is important because younger people are more likely to identify with the need for social and environmental change. While the stereotype of rich kids popping champagne on family yachts is often true, many of them are also keen to fund positive change. Almost 90 per cent of heirs surveyed in 2018 by Credit Suisse Group AG and the Young Investors Organization said they were interested in making impact investments.Almost 90 per cent of heirs surveyed in 2018 \u2026 said they were interested in making impact investments. \n \nThe Global Impact Investing Network estimates that around US$502 billion is currently being managed in impact investing assets globally and networks such as The ImPact and Nexus Global have sprung up requiring participants to pledge investment. While more than 100 students have participated in the Harvard course, they\u2019re only a fraction of the wealthy millennials who are attracted to the idea. The Asian Venture Philanthropy Network expects the momentum to continue, with 35 per cent of the region\u2019s wealth set to shift to the next generation over the coming five to seven years.Singaporean Rebekah Lin is studying gerontology at King\u2019s College in London after becoming interested in impact investing. Her father helped found Singapore-based private equity firm Tembusu Partners and has long supported charitable causes. But even he still needed persuading that business and social good could be combined, she said.\u201cTraditional Chinese and Asian families are still quite conservative \u2014 they want to take a longer time to decide what they want to give and are a lot more hands-on,\u201d said Lin, 33. Thus she and the growing pool of her peers who are keen to work in the space spend much of their time \u201cproving their mettle and making sure they have a couple of years in finance, or with an impact investing firm, to show their parents they\u2019re serious about it.\u201d\n\nLessons in the Harvard/Zurich course include how millennial heirs can navigate family politics to convince people to back their ideas.\n\nBloomberg file photo\n\nIt\u2019s why a key segment of the Harvard course focuses on how to change the status quo from the inside. Over the week of transoceanic classroom study and 40 hours of individual and group work, participants learn how to source deals, conduct due diligence and evaluate the social as well as financial impacts of an investment.They\u2019re also taught soft skills \u2014 how to navigate family politics to convince people to back their ideas. Graduates are encouraged to examine assets in the family business that could be used to deliver aid, such as a fishing fleet in Indonesia or an investment office in Bangkok.\u201cWhen people see there are people changing the world and earning a lot of money at the same time, I believe it will set an example for others of our generation to follow,\u201d said Cheng Ming Zhe, an analyst at Singapore-based multifamily office Golden Equator Wealth, whose family made a fortune in property. Cheng met like-minded heirs through a course on social entrepreneurship at the University of Oxford last year and has a friend that did the Harvard program.To be sure, there\u2019s no guarantee that such clubs, groups and courses aren\u2019t little more than fashionable embellishments for the well-heeled. Good impact investments are hard to find and often come with higher risks, so enthusiasm could wane when transactions sour \u2014 just 24 per cent of next-generation heirs surveyed by the Young Investors Organization and Credit Suisse had actually put money into this type of product.But for now courses like the one at Harvard are helping bring like-minded investors together to create valuable bonds. One evening in April, 10 young heirs, including a graduate of the program, stepped through a door disguised as a refrigerator and into a Singapore speakeasy called The Dragon Chamber.Over rounds of stir-fried chicken with Sichuan pepper and battered durian desserts, they voiced their discontent about the private-banker attitudes standing in their way. Few had met before, but all expressed a sense of liberation that they were no longer alone and a belief they can bring about change.\u201cThere are literally tens of thousands of ultra-high-net-worth people, and a lot would have multiple children,\u201d UBS\u2019s Gifford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely scratched the surface.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Another misstep as B.C. fails to prove this tycoon's idyllic estate was bought with embezzled money", "description": "Salt Spring Island laundering claim by B.C. government had tenuous link to the Indian owner, who had purchased years before alleged crime", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/one-tycoon-was-wrongly-ensnared-in-vancouver-dirty-money-probe", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/asalt_spring_property.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 10, 2019 1:07 PM EDT", "content": "It appeared to be the coup de gr\u00e2ce of a Canadian dirty money probe into real estate: a sprawling island manor off the coast of Vancouver that the government said was linked directly to an alleged criminal conspiracy at a state-run Indian bank.A six-month investigation commissioned by the province of British Columbia had scoured more than a million land titles for signs of illicit funds swirling through Canada\u2019s most expensive housing market.

In Canada, you can\u2019t really say that.\u201dHere are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada \u2014 and one that shows why the country\u2019s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada\u2019s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s about as low as it gets, historically,\u201d said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn\u2019t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.\u201cIf there were to be a recession, whether it\u2019s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,\u201d Lascelles said in a separate webcast. \u201cThey just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.\u201dDebt-to-Income RatioCanada\u2019s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada\u2019s households are \u201csubstantially more leveraged\u201d than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.Debt Service RatioIn Canada, the debt service ratio \u2014 the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt \u2014 climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern.\u201dBecause the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThe vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It\u2019s not whether you have a lot of debt, it\u2019s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada\u2019s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.\u201dIf the housing market implodes \u2014 which Lascelles isn\u2019t expecting \u2014 it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. \u201cAnd so to the extent we haven\u2019t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren\u2019t as many households that are vulnerable.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious there\u2019s a debt crisis in the making though.

Yields on government 2-year bonds held steady at 1.38 per cent. The spread against U.S. Treasuries of equivalent maturity narrowed to 43 basis points, the tightest in more than a year.In Canada, all indications point to an economy growing at a much faster pace than it had in the final three months of last year and the beginning of 2019. Along with the jobs report, recent data show a strong rebound in output in March, signs of stabilization in housing and improving export numbers. Economists anticipate growth will accelerate to more than 2 per cent on an annualized basis in the second quarter.Canadian employment is now up 2.4 per cent from the same period in 2018, the largest year-over-year increase since before the 2008-2009 recession. The number of people unemployed is also the lowest in a decade. Over the past two years, Canada\u2019s economy has added almost 700,000 new jobs.Three provinces relatively immune from the recent weakness in the oil sector \u2014 Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec \u2014 are mostly responsible for the growth in employment, as are service-related industries such as transportation, technology and professionals.Companies that have been hiring include Staples Canada, Canada Goose Holdings, Accenture, along with a surge in employment by technology companies.\u201cOne of the things that I suspect is happening there is that global technology companies that are by and large US-based, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons, etc., are hiring workers to a greater extent in this geography relative to the U.S.,\u201d Neil Selfe, a founding partner at Infor Financial Group, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. That\u2019s \u201cbecause of the visa issues and the immigration issues of the Trump administration.\u201dCanada has been able to produce strong job gains over the past two years largely because of a rapid increase in the labour force, on higher immigration and youth participation. The bigger risk in Canada is the labour force growth won\u2019t be sustained and the market could tighten. For example, the labour force dropped by 49,200 in May, one of the largest one-month declines, after surging in recent months.As a result, rising demand for workers was met by tapping into the unemployed ranks. The number of people looking for work and unable to find it dropped by 76,900 in May, the biggest one-month decline since 1993.Another sign of tightening is that the recent acceleration in wage growth is holding. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.8 per cent in May, from 2.5 per cent in April, bringing it to the fastest since August last year. Pay gains for permanent employees were steady at 2.6 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ania Nussbaum, Tommaso Ebhardt and Geraldine Amiel", "title": "The deal that ran out of road: How the Fiat-Renault merger died", "description": "Patience wore thin for the Fiat chairman after numerous attempts to persuade Renault to get Nissan fully on board.

The group had gathered for the second time in as many days to sign off on a proposed merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. As the talks dragged on, a delegate for the state asked to liaise with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who was having dinner back in town at his hulking ministry protruding into the River Seine.Le Maire laid down a red line for Martin Vial, his representative at the table and the voice of Renault\u2019s biggest and most powerful shareholder. France wanted a commitment from Renault partner Nissan Motor Co. to back the combination. Abstention \u2014 as signalled earlier by the Japanese side \u2014 wasn\u2019t good enough, Le Maire said, fearing that Nissan might begin undermining the alliance if it couldn\u2019t be held accountable with a firm vote. \nRenault and Fiat shares skid after $35 billion merger deal collapses\n\u2018Risks, opportunities\u2019 for Canadian auto sector from potential impact of a Fiat-Renault mega-deal\nFiat Chrysler seeks merger with Renault to create world\u2019s third biggest carmaker\nBack in the conference room, the servings of sushi and pizza sourced by security guards had lost their appeal by the time the group reconvened around 11 p.m. The mood, too, was drab. It quickly became clear that Nissan would, in fact, abstain in a vote. When the turn came to Vial to speak, he presented the panel with the government\u2019s game plan.The minister saw an opening to get Nissan on board: On the June 8-9 weekend, G-20 finance ministers would be gathering in Fukuoka, Japan, and Le Maire wanted to use his persuasive powers to win over the Japanese partner. Then, to everyone\u2019s surprise and some annoyance, Vial suggested they postpone the vote and reconvene the following week after Le Maire had returned.In Italy, meanwhile, John Elkann\u2019s patience was wearing thin. The scion of the Agnelli family and disciple of the late Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne was also getting updates on the meeting back in Paris, and to him, this latest government curveball was one too many. Elkann had spent weeks stitching together the deal with Renault CEO Jean-Dominique Senard, keeping the French government closely informed, and felt that he had met their demands at every turn. An hours-long board meeting on Tuesday had ended without a vote because representatives wanted more time, and now Elkann\u2019s appetite for further delays was exhausted.\n\nJohn Elkann\n\nAfter a brief phone conversation with Senard in Paris, the 43-year-old orchestrated a stunning manoeuvre. He gathered the Fiat Chrysler board members for a quick meeting, where the group decided to withdraw its proposal to merge. Shortly after 1 a.m., the company sent a terse release, all but blaming the French government for the decision by saying the country lacked the \u201cpolitical conditions\u201d to support the accord.And so imploded one of the most ambitious global mergers in recent years, less than two weeks after it was first disclosed, an audacious plan to emulsify diverse car brands from France, the U.S. and Italy into the world\u2019s No. 3 \u2014 with the promise of reaching the pinnacle if Japan could later be brought into the fold.(This account of the final days of the negotiations leading up to the midnight breakdown is based on accounts from people close to the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The carmakers and the government declined to comment on the meetings.)In the runup to the shocking collapse, all sides had appeared on a path to get the deal through. Elkann and Senard had built a close rapport in recent weeks, frequently meeting in Paris or Turin for informal gatherings to hammer out the finer points. The two European companies also made sure to keep the door open for Nissan should the Japanese partner want to join the group at a later stage.\n\nRenault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard speaks during a press conference at the Nissan headquarters in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture.\n\nBehrouz MEHRI / AFP\n\nThe French government, with its 15 per cent stake in Renault that comes with powerful double voting rights, also showed support, albeit with some strings attached: the merger should function within the Renault-Nissan framework and not jeopardize the successful partnership; jobs and production sites in France needed to be protected; governance should be maintained; and the group should participate in a project to create a European battery champion.Nissan\u2019s role in particular was an important sticking point for the government. Senard traveled to Japan in the week after the deal was disclosed for an alliance board meeting; there, he took the opportunity to lay out the virtues of the combination with Fiat. France wanted Nissan firmly behind the deal, fearing that any opposition \u2014 or even just lukewarm support \u2014 would risk alienating a cherished industrial partner over time.But as the Renault board prepared to meet on June 4 at the headquarters, Nissan\u2019s position became increasingly precarious. CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the Japanese company needed to review the future of the alliance, including contractual relationships, culminating in Nissan\u2019s decision to abstain from a vote. In the end, the first gathering wrapped up without any firm outcome, the group having spent an hour instead poring over the latest findings linked to disgraced former CEO Carlos Ghosn. They agreed to reconvene the next day.\n\nFrance\u2019s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was reluctant to go ahead with the deal without firm support from Nissan.\n\nBenoit Tessier / Reuters\n\nBy the time the panel regrouped at 6 p.m. on June 5, the weariness of the inconclusive meeting had blown over, and optimism set in that the second attempt would push things along. A press conference had been tentatively arranged in Paris for the following day, the release all but prepared and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley flying in from the U.S. for the occasion. The French CGT labour union was the only negative voice at the table, but one that could be easily drowned out from the overwhelming chorus of support.Then the great plan came crashing down, with Bloomberg News reporting in the small hours of Thursday that Fiat had withdrawn its offer.The French government, for its part, was stunned by Elkann\u2019s move, and needed a few hours to regain its footing. When it did, the blame game didn\u2019t take long to erupt. Unwilling to be seen as the disrupting factor, the government said it hadn\u2019t closed any doors, and that all it had asked for was another five days to win over Nissan. Topics like valuation, governance and jobs had been agreed upon, a French official told reporters during a briefing.It's as important to walk away from the table as it is to sit down.Former Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne \n \nRenault, too, lamented the breakdown of the negotiations, thanking Nissan for its \u201cconstructive approach\u201d to the deliberations and Fiat for its efforts. Fiat, on the other hand, saw the French state as the culprit, saying the government repeatedly attempted to change conditions for its support and leaving Elkann with the impression that the state was clamouring for full control of the combined entity, a demand that was unacceptable to Fiat.\u201cWhen it becomes clear that the discussions have been taken as far as they can reasonably go, it is necessary to be equally decisive in drawing matters to a close,\u201d Elkann said in a letter to employees.In doing so, Elkann took a page from the deal book of his mentor Marchionne, who died last year following an illness and who had been a tireless champion of consolidation in the automotive industry.\u201cIt\u2019s as important to walk away from the table as it is to sit down,\u201d Marchionne said in 2014.\u2014 With assistance from Gregory Viscusi, Reed Stevenson, Ma Jie, Helene Fouquet, Daniele Lepido and Aaron Kirchfeld.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home sales surge back to highest levels since 2017 \u2014 that's pre-stress test", "description": "That is just before new mortgage stress test came into place", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-spring-back-to-highest-levels-since-2017", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/house.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 5, 2019 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market came storming back in May.Sales in Canada\u2019s biggest city soared 19 per cent from the same month a year earlier to 9,989 transactions, while prices rose, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Wednesday.

Only about $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) of Canadian uninsured mortgages have been pooled in RMBS deals, or about 0.1 per cent of the country\u2019s mortgage debt, according to rating company DBRS Ltd. No lender has widely marketed such a deal since September, when private lender MCAP sold $254 million of the notes.While previous efforts to kick-start an RMBS market have borne little fruit, this time may be different as Canadian home prices are rising at the slowest pace this decade amid higher interest rates, regulatory changes and tax increases designed to reign in surging prices, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver. \nBank of Montreal joins Poloz\u2019s push to bolster market for residential mortgage-backed securities\nThe Bank of Canada is pushing a private mortgage-backed securities market \u2014 but is anybody buying?\nStephen Poloz\u2019s \u2018call to arms\u2019 for mortgage market shakeup is something worth fighting for\n\u201cWhile lenders are very well equipped to manage normal market risks, I suspect they are rather unwilling to take on the additional risk of future government intervention in the housing markets,\u201d said Andrey Pavlov, a professor of finance at Beedie School of Business of Simon Fraser University in Greater Vancouver. \u201cTherefore, lenders are likely more interested today than they have ever been in hedging their residential real estate exposure, and mortgage backed securities would be a good way to do so.\u201dLenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and returns \u2014 too much risk it turned out during the U.S. financial crisis when shady loans made it into MBS tranches. There\u2019s been little evidence risky mortgages have become a feature in Canada. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property.On top of raising funds, the sellers of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital they have to set aside to cover eventual losses should they meet certain conditions, including selling significant portions of the lower rated, higher risk bond tranches.Longer TermThe notes are repaid as borrowers pay down debt. The legal duration of the bonds could be significantly longer than the expected repayment rate suggests. This could be a useful tool for lenders to offer longer-term mortgages in a country where most of the home loans have a 5-year term. The repayment of the bonds can be adapted to the repayment of the underlying collateral.Up until 2016, Canadian lenders relied heavily on Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., the country\u2019s national housing agency to insure mortgages with down payments of less than 20 per cent and then packaged those loans into mortgage-backed securities to fund obligations. But as part of its efforts to curb taxpayer exposure to the housing market, the government made it more difficult to get insurance. The market for uninsured mortgages took off \u2014 MBS based on the debt less so.\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing education job around investors just to highlight the difference between that product and the CMHC product, and we are investing in that so that the market grows over time,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Financial Officer Tom Flynn said in an interview last week. The RMBS \u201cmarket is not nearly as developed as the CMHC mortgage bond market is. I would say our hope is over time that market will grow, and the banks generally I believe are interested in issuing that product.\u201dThe Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of participants in the bond market, has been working since at least last year to analyze the conditions and incentives that would be required to expand interest in the asset class, according to the minutes of their meetings. It conducted a focus group last month with mostly buy side institutions about the disclosure on the underlying collateral and other features they may require. The group, known as CFIF, was scheduled to discuss the issue again at a June 4 meeting.Data PortalOne way to bolster investors\u2019 confidence in deals would be by setting up a public database of mortgages used in securitization deals including anonymized details of the borrower, property and loan performance, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said last month. A similar project was supported by the European Central Bank in a bid to re-start sales of asset-backed securities after investors shunned hard-to-value assets following the seizure of the U.S. mortgage securitization market in 2007.\u201cA loan level data portal is a great idea,\u201d said Imran Chaudhry, a senior portfolio manager at Forresters Asset Management Inc., which manages about $8.5 billion of assets and has invested in Canadian securitizations. \u201cIssuing public RMBS deals would provide a larger investor base to the issuers and help establish a diversified funding source for them over a longer term.\u201dThe starting point of RMBS as a funding tool isn\u2019t the most attractive for banks as investors may demand an extra yield of 20 to 30 basis points over their senior bail-in debt in a stable market situation, said Chaudhry, who is part of the CFIF. Yet, once a market develops the spreads will tighten and it will make economic sense for the lenders to issue, he said.Uninsured SurgeAll these efforts are occurring at a time when the household debt-to-disposable income ratio in Canada at the end of 2018 hit a record high of 175 per cent, up from 136 per cent in 2006. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income ended last year at 98 per cent, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cA key domestic risk is a sharp correction in the housing market,\u201d officials at International Monetary Fund said in May 21 statement about the state of the Canadian economy. To be sure strong immigration, underlying strength in the economy and an unemployment rate near historic lows argues against such a scenario.Lenders\u2019 exposure to an eventual downturn may be increasing. According to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canadian bank regulator, the ratio of uninsured over insured mortgages has jumped to the highest since 1997.At the end of March, the volume of uninsured mortgages surged 14 per cent from a year ago, accounting for about 59 per cent of the $1.17 trillion of home loans at Canada\u2019s federally regulated banks, while insured home loans fell 7.8 per cent from a year ago, according to data from OSFI. On Tuesday, the regulator announced it was increasing a domestic stability buffer for systemically important banks to 2 per cent of their risk weighted assets from 1.75 per cent, effective Oct. 31, citing vulnerabilities that include household indebtedness.\u201cTo be clear, the system is not broken \u2014 it has served Canadians and financial institutions well,\u201d said Poloz in a May 6 speech in Winnipeg. \u201cWe should not stop looking for improvement.\u201d\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg, Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander and Esteban Duarte", "title": "Bank of Montreal joins Poloz's push to bolster market for residential mortgage-backed securities", "description": "Residential mortgage-backed securities are the financing source for less than one per cent of outstanding home loans in Canada", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/bank-of-montreal-joins-polozs-push-to-bolster-market-for-residential-mortgage-backed-securities", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/bmo-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 30, 2019 12:59 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of Montreal, Canada\u2019s fourth largest bank, is working toward expanding the investor base for a residential mortgage-backed securities just as Bank of Canada\u2019s governor Stephen Poloz highlighted the idea of having such a market as a useful funding and risk management tool.Residential mortgage-backed securities are the financing source for less than one per cent of outstanding home loans in Canada, according to DBRS data.

That would mark a fifth straight hold by the central bank since it last raised borrowing costs in October. Longer-term, most analysts predict rates won\u2019t rise again until next year at the earliest.It\u2019s a reflection of an economy, only just emerging from a serious slowdown, that\u2019s still too fragile to cope with higher rates. Businesses are spooked by global trade uncertainty. Low oil prices and transportation constraints have hobbled the crucial energy sector. Record debt levels are a dead weight on consumer spending. Policy makers don\u2019t even know for sure how past rate increases \u2014 five since mid-2017 \u2014 are affecting households. \nMarkets are more gloomy about our economy than the Bank of Canada \u2014 who\u2019s right?\nBank of Canada done raising rates until end of 2020, with 40% chance of cut, poll says\nPoloz sees higher interest rates on the horizon once economy exits current soft patch\nInvestors, more pessimistic than analysts, are betting on cuts rather than hikes. They see an 80 per cent chance of one rate cut over the next 12 months. In the U.S., conviction on lower rates is even stronger, with at least two rate cuts priced in over that period.Still, the Bank of Canada has shown no inclination to loosen policy. For one, officials are wary of encouraging more borrowing in an economy already saddled with debt. Underlying price pressures, meanwhile, have been hovering around the 2 per cent target for more than a year. As recently as last week, Poloz continued to argue for the long-term need for higher rates.There are also federal elections. While the central bank in the past has adjusted rates in the months leading up to a general vote, policy makers would need to consider the political optics of any move \u2014 either up or down. That raises the bar for any change.The most likely reason for the Bank of Canada to be pulled off the sidelines before the October election would be an adverse global economic or financial event. This could take the form of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, a correction in global financial markets, a cut in rates by the Federal Reserve \u2014 or a combination of these.Outside of global developments, there aren\u2019t any obvious made-in-Canada triggers for Poloz to move in the next six months.The central bank has already cut its first-half growth forecast to below what most analysts expect. That means policy makers are unlikely to be disappointed enough by the data to contemplate a cut.Recent economic numbers on employment, housing and manufacturing have actually surprised to the upside \u2014 but no one believes a better-than-expected performance in the first six months of this year will be enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to seriously consider a hike.The Bank of Canada is more optimistic about the economy in the second half and into 2020, when it expects growth to sustainably return to more normal levels of about 2 per cent. If that scenario plays out, then rate hikes are possible. If the numbers disappoint, cuts could be on the table.\u201cThe battleground is going to be the third quarter,\u201d said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada. The \u201cearliest that you can expect something from the bank \u2014 I think it\u2019s also on the down rather than the up \u2014 would be\u201d at the Oct. 30 rate decision.The full picture for that quarter however won\u2019t appear until output data are released at the end of November.

The country also is a mature market for banking, with lenders getting much of their growth by stealing market share from each other. Canada\u2019s economic prospects are forecast to lag behind those of its southern neighbour. Gross domestic product in Canada is expected to grow 1.5 per cent this year, compared with 2.6 per cent for the U.S.That bodes well for Canadian banks with operations abroad \u2014 and less so for those relying on domestic businesses to fuel growth. Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal, lenders with significant operations outside the country, report their results next week.Earnings at Canadian banks\u2019 domestic personal and commercial divisions were expected to rise 5.2 per cent on average from a year earlier, less than the 14.3 per cent increase forecast for their U.S. and international consumer-lending units, RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic said in a note to clients earlier this month.At Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which gets a greater share of profits from domestic consumer banking than its peers, earnings from its personal and small business banking division fell 2.4 per cent to $570 million. CIBC\u2019s biggest profit gains, meanwhile, came from U.S. commercial banking and wealth management, with 18 per cent growth. Canadian mortgages declined, home-equity credit lines were little changed and loan-loss provisions rose from a year ago.At Royal Bank, earnings rose 2.4 per cent in the company\u2019s Canadian division, its smallest year-over-year growth in five quarters, and far smaller than the 17 per cent jump in RBC Capital Markets earnings and 8.9 per cent surge in wealth management, which includes earnings from Los Angeles-based City National Bank.U.S. BranchesEven Toronto-Dominion, with retail-banking operations on both sides of the border, saw a greater boost from the U.S. than from Canada. Earnings from Canadian retail, which includes wealth management, rose just 0.9 per cent, while the bank\u2019s U.S. retail division, including the TD Ameritrade discount brokerage, soared 29 per cent. With a network that stretches from Maine to Florida, Toronto-Dominion has more bank branches in the U.S. than in Canada.Canadian consumer banking still represents the biggest share of profits at the country\u2019s financial companies, representing almost half of earnings on average for the big banks.Scotiabank \u2014 Canada\u2019s most international bank, with operations in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia \u2014 reports earnings on May 28, and Bank of Montreal, whose non-domestic operations include Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, follows the next day.

She says the Netherlands, considered to be at the forefront in tackling dirty money, had earlier made the same mistake that \u201cmoney laundering only took place in Chinese restaurants and casinos.\u201d\u201cThe big money, I\u2019m still convinced, doesn\u2019t come from China,\u201d said Unger by phone from Vienna. \u201cThe big money comes from the U.S. and from Europe because these are the rich countries, which use Canada as a wide-open door because it has much lower restrictions on where to place your money and how to stay anonymous.\u201dCash GiftsThe second report had featured a luxury car dealer describing how foreign students come in 10 times a month with no credit and no income and get auto financing based on wire transfers as \u201cunequivocally money laundering.\u201dFlamboyant displays of wealth by students may be unpalatable but not necessarily criminal. An international student who returns home periodically typically isn\u2019t required to report or pay taxes on income from abroad, while cash gifts from family members aren\u2019t taxable under Canadian rules.The second study sifted through more than a million land titles looking for red flags such as overseas buyers, properties bought without financing, opaque addresses and unusual mortgage terms. More than 2,000 properties were classified high risk for simply having mailing addresses in China or Hong Kong.Ultimately, it concluded the approach had limitations.\u201cThe \u2018suspicious properties\u2019 analysis suggests that a scoring system may not be an effective way to detect properties linked to money laundering,\u201d the study said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson and Natalie Wong", "title": "Vancouver\u2019s dirty money figures: The smoking gun that wasn\u2019t", "description": "A closer reading of the studies show there's little hard evidence of actual money laundering, and even then, the amounts could be much smaller", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/vancouvers-dirty-money-figures-the-smoking-gun-that-wasnt?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vancouver-skyline.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 16, 2019 2:31 PM EDT", "content": "When British Columbia released its bombshell findings last week that more than $7 billion (US$5.2 billion) was laundered in a single year through the Canadian province \u2014 mostly through real estate \u2014 it trumpeted that \u201cthousands\u201d of properties might be involved.It appeared to be conclusive evidence of what many in the city suspected: the 60 per cent surge in Vancouver housing prices in the five years through 2017 was fuelled in part by dirty cash, a big chunk flowing from Asia.But the government\u2019s case may be less conclusive than it appeared.

The report said its best estimate was a range of 3.7 per cent to 7.5 per cent but noted \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about the figures.\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous oversimplification,\u201d says Matthew McGuire, a forensic accountant who previously worked for Canada\u2019s financial intelligence unit. \u201cThere is money being laundered through real estate, yes, but the factors that influence the change in prices of real estate are far more complex and far greater than just criminality.\u201dOn Wednesday, a government news release said the impact on Metro Vancouver prices may have been \u201cupwards of 20 per cent\u201d \u2014 the kind of geographic granularity that\u2019s impossible to calculate with current data, the report\u2019s chair Maureen Maloney had said earlier this week. The offices of Horgan, James and Attorney General David Eby didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Vancouver has for years been riveted by stories of rich Asians moving cash into the region: students and homemakers declaring no income but owning multi-million-dollar homes, Chinese high rollers showing up at casinos with hockey bags brimming with cash, and most recently, a thriving grey market in Vancouver-to-China luxury car exports that sent millions of dollars in sales-tax refunds to overseas buyers.Electronic LaunderingThat\u2019s fed the perception that Vancouver\u2019s money-laundering problem is in large part an Asian one.But rich economies generate the most dirty money and from crimes related to the financial sector that can move billions at the push of a button, according to Brigitte Unger, a professor at Utrecht University who modelled the Canadian study. She says the Netherlands, considered to be at the forefront in tackling dirty money, had earlier made the same mistake that \u201cmoney laundering only took place in Chinese restaurants and casinos.\u201d\u201cThe big money, I\u2019m still convinced, doesn\u2019t come from China,\u201d said Unger by phone from Vienna. \u201cThe big money comes from the U.S. and from Europe because these are the rich countries, which use Canada as a wide-open door because it has much lower restrictions on where to place your money and how to stay anonymous.\u201dCash GiftsThe second report had featured a luxury car dealer describing how foreign students come in 10 times a month with no credit and no income and get auto financing based on wire transfers as \u201cunequivocally money laundering.\u201dFlamboyant displays of wealth by students may be unpalatable but not necessarily criminal. An international student who returns home periodically typically isn\u2019t required to report or pay taxes on income from abroad, while cash gifts from family members aren\u2019t taxable under Canadian rules.The second study sifted through more than a million land titles looking for red flags such as overseas buyers, properties bought without financing, opaque addresses and unusual mortgage terms. More than 2,000 properties were classified high risk for simply having mailing addresses in China or Hong Kong.Ultimately, it concluded the approach had limitations.\u201cThe \u2018suspicious properties\u2019 analysis suggests that a scoring system may not be an effective way to detect properties linked to money laundering,\u201d the study said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "The Bank of Canada is underestimating the housing slump, Capital Economics warns", "description": "Developers are having a harder time securing their projects, senior economist says, which will bruise employment and consumption", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-bank-of-canada-is-underestimating-the-housing-slump-capital-economics-warns?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/construction.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 14, 2019 2:25 PM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada may be underestimating the extent of the cooling in the country\u2019s housing market as well as its knock-on effects for the consumer-driven economy, according to research firm Capital Economics.Sales of pre-construction units in Toronto and Vancouver slowed in 2018, making it harder for developers to secure financing for their projects, said Stephen Brown, the firm\u2019s senior economist for Canada.

Two-year Canadian government bond yields climbed 4 basis points to 1.62 per cent, as investors pared bets the Bank of Canada would need to cut rates to fuel the expansion. \nHow much do we owe against our homes? Not even the Bank of Canada knows for sure\nExports bounce back after a brutal winter for Canadian trade\nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: The latest charts that matter most to the Bank of Canada\nCanada has added 426,400 jobs over the past 12 months, the largest one-year increase since 2007 and up 2.3 per cent over that period. Over the past two years, the economy has added 700,000 jobs.\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s a little more strength left in the Canadian economy,\u201d Brian DePratto, a senior economist at Toronto Dominion Bank, said in a telephone interview.For months, the labour market had been the lone bright spot in a struggling economy, and was the only thing giving policy makers much comfort.We have a plan to grow our economy \u2013 and it\u2019s working. Canadians have created over 1 million jobs since 2015, including more than 100,000 in the last month alone \u2013 most of which are full time. https://t.co/ciuq0RYfNt\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) May 10, 2019Analysts had warned as recently as last month that Canada ran the risk of falling into a recession amid a perfect storm of negative factors \u2014 falling oil prices, volatile financial markets, higher interest rates, cooling housing markets and global trade tensions. But many of these elements have begun to reverse.Exporters showed across-the-board resiliency in March, after shipments tumbled in February. Toronto\u2019s housing market, the country\u2019s largest, is stabilizing after a recent slump. There are also signs consumers continue to spend and borrow, aided in large part by the strong labour market, even amid worries about the outlook.The job gains in April were broad-based \u2013 across industries, regions and demographics \u2014with few weaknesses. Most of the gains were full-time, up 73,000, and in the private sector. Both goods-producing and services sectors recorded gains.Even wages \u2013 which have been sluggish \u2013 are showing signs of life. Annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.5 per cent in April, the fastest annual gain since September, up from 2.4 per cent in March. Pay gains for permanent employees rose to 2.6 per cent, the strongest increase since August.Total hours worked also picked up, increasing by 1.3 per cent annually in April, from 0.9 per cent in March.The jobs increases have largely reflected higher labour force numbers as the economy pulls in new workers \u2013 youth and immigrants in particular \u2013 rather than falling unemployment. The number of people in the labour force jumped by 108,100 in April, also a one-month record, on a surge in youth participation.\u201cWe\u2019re drawing in people, and that tells you how tight the labour market is,\u201d Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics, said by phone.Regionally, there were gains in most provinces including Alberta, which saw 21,400 jobs created. Employment in Ontario jumped by 47,000 in April, with job increases in Canada\u2019s largest province at 205,000 over the past year. Quebec employment rose by 38,000, dropping its unemployment rate to 4.9 per cent, the lowest in data going back to 1976.Strong increases in youth employment also lowered the unemployment rate for that demographic to record lows.Erik Hertzberg and Josh Wingrove contributed to this report"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "How much do we owe against our homes?

The central bank has been working informally with lenders on the reporting, which becomes a formal requirement as of May 15. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-056bbae27b3e4c69bb511884867e12d5-5ebcd9e40f11f');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-056bbae27b3e4c69bb511884867e12d5-5ebcd9e40f11f');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-056bbae27b3e4c69bb511884867e12d5-5ebcd9e40f11f'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nHelocs can add to debt burdens because they don\u2019t typically have a fixed repayment schedule. If home prices fall, borrowers can find themselves with more debt than their properties are worth, the dreaded \u201cnegative equity\u201d scenario that played a significant role in the U.S. housing crash a decade ago. The issue has come into focus as Canada\u2019s ratio of debt to disposable income reached a record 174 per cent in the fourth quarter.\u201cGiven the flexibility Helocs can provide, borrowers can use them even in a downturn or if they lost their jobs to sustain household spending and continue to service their other debt,\u201d Robert Colangelo at credit rating company DBRS Ltd. said in a phone interview. \u201cIt makes it difficult for lenders to identify emerging credit problems.\u201d \nStephen Poloz\u2019s \u2018call to arms\u2019 for mortgage market shakeup is something worth fighting for\nWhy mortgage reform may have to wait for legislation, despite Poloz\u2019s musings\nVancouver\u2019s housing market is dismal \u2014 but you still need six-figure income to get your foot in the door\nLess RiskyOne obstacle to getting a clear picture is that Helocs themselves are evolving.Traditional Helocs are essentially revolving lines of credit that allow homeowners to borrow up to 65 per cent of their home\u2019s value. The interest rate is usually tied to the prime lending rate, and only the interest on the loan needs to be paid each month. To qualify for a Heloc, the borrower must have at least 20 per cent home equity.Newer products combine a Heloc with a mortgage. These allow borrowers to tap as much as 80 per cent of the home\u2019s value. A maximum of 65 per cent can be withdrawn on a revolving basis \u2014 the Heloc portion \u2014 while a minimum of 15 per cent must be amortizing, meaning regular payments of principal and interest, similar to a mortgage.Hybrids ExpandingGrowth in stand-alone Helocs has been flat, while all of the banks are seeing strong growth in the hybrid product, which is relatively less risky because it\u2019s partly amortizing, according to Himanshu Bakshi, credit research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. However, these hybrid Helocs are more complex than traditional ones, he said.Here\u2019s what we do know.Canada\u2019s six biggest banks reported $223 billion of outstanding, or drawn, Helocs as of Jan. 31. That accounted for about a tenth of the country\u2019s $2.17 trillion total household debt.But the banks don\u2019t disclose Heloc balances in the same way. The following was reported in regulatory filings or confirmed by representatives of the banks:\u2022 Toronto-Dominion Bank reported $87 billion of Helocs. However, it said 60 per cent of that, or $52.2 billion, was the amortizing portion of its blended Heloc-mortgage product, with the remaining $34.8 billion non-amortizing. \u2022 Royal Bank of Canada reported $39.6 billion of non-amortizing Helocs. A spokeswoman said the bank\u2019s amortizing home equity product is classified as a mortgage. The bank said in a filing that \u2018home equity lines of credit include term loans collateralized by residential mortgages. \u2022 Similarly, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce doesn\u2019t disclose the breakdown of amortizing versus non-amortizing balances for its hybrid product. It reported $21.8 billion in non-amortizing Helocs. \u2022 Bank of Nova Scotia reported $20.8 billion in Helocs, which only includes non-amortizing balances. Amortizing balances are reported under residential mortgages. \u2022 Bank of Montreal reports similarly to Toronto-Dominion. A spokesman said 55 per cent, or $17.4 billion of its $31.7 billion in Helocs was amortizing, while the rest, $14.3 billion, was non-amortizing. \u2022 National Bank of Canada reported $22.2 billion of Helocs, half of which are amortizing and the other half non-amortizing, according to a spokesman.One of the major concerns about non-amortizing Helocs is the possibility for borrowers to pay only the monthly interest due on the loan. A recent government report found about a quarter of Heloc borrowers routinely make interest-only payments.However, some lenders put that figure much lower. Toronto-Dominion said less than 14 per cent of its Heloc customers made interest-only payments in the past year. RBC said 7 per cent of clients for its Homeline Heloc product make only the scheduled interest payment. None of the other banks disclose that figure.According to a document on the website of Canada\u2019s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the central bank will require a more detailed breakdown of Helocs, as well as the utilization rate, or the share of drawn amounts versus approved amounts.The Heloc data will feed into the central bank\u2019s analysis of financial system vulnerabilities and risks, spokeswoman Louise Egan said in an email. In efforts to balance transparency, confidentiality and quality, \u201cdata identifying an individual institution will not be published,\u201d she said.Toronto-Dominion Bank and Scotiabank declined to comment on the new reporting requirements, while CIBC, BMO and National Bank didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment. A Royal Bank representative said only the bank would comply with the regulations.With assistance from Paul Gulberg, Himanshu Bakshi and Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong", "title": "CMHC will share equity losses, gains in Trudeau's first-time homebuyer plan", "description": "CMHC CEO says the program will have zero impact on house prices across the country", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/cmhc-will-share-equity-losses-gains-in-first-time-buyer-plan?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 9, 2019 10:42 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plan to make housing more affordable for millennials could result in shared gains \u2014 or losses \u2014 for taxpayers.The government announced in its March federal budget that Canada\u2019s housing agency will spend up to $1.25 billion (US$928 million) over three years to take equity stakes in homes bought by first-time buyers.

Its University of British Columbia has been called the University of Beautiful Cars for its student-owned fleet of Lamborghinis, Aston Martins and Porsches. At one point, the city of 2.4 million had one of the world\u2019s top-performing Rolls-Royce dealerships. As one dealer quoted by the report puts it, \u201cwe are selling way too many luxury and premium cars for this economy, for what people earn here.\u201d \nB.C.\u2019s dirty money crackdown puts a damper on Vancouver\u2019s once-rollicking casinos\nA closer look at the taxes that sent Vancouver\u2019s luxury housing market reeling\nCanada ignored its gigantic money laundering problem for years \u2014 and lawyers fanned the flames\nChina Export SchemeThe probe\u2019s biggest surprise finding was a booming trade in luxury vehicle exports driven by an arbitrage between the price of high-end cars in Canada versus China. The government described that grey market as \u201cideal\u201d for facilitating trade-based money laundering.In the scheme, buyers overseas use a local nominee to purchase a vehicle for immediate export \u2014 a lucrative trade because a luxury car can cost double in China what it does in North America after a markup by manufacturers and taxes. To sweeten the deal, the so-called straw buyer can then claim a sales tax refund because the vehicle was exported. This can amount to as much as 20 per cent of the purchase price on the most expensive car.We are selling way too many luxury and premium cars for this economy, for what people earn hereCar dealer \n \nNone of that is illegal. \u201cWhere it becomes problematic is how people purchase these vehicles,\u201d said German. \u201cWith cash, with bank drafts anonymously, and so forth.\u201dThe scheme provides an easy way for illicit money to be placed in the financial system since car dealerships can accept large cash payments and aren\u2019t required to report them, according to the report. \u201cFurthermore, as this trade-based activity involves large dollar sums leaving China, it generally requires the services of an underground banker,\u201d it said.Grey Market ExplosionThere\u2019s been an explosion in the number of grey market vehicles exported to China \u2014 to over 4,400 in 2018 from less than 100 in 2013, according to the report. During that period, the province refunded almost $85 million (US$63 million) in sales-tax refunds and had to hire more staff to deal with the number of applications.In many cases, applicants seeking refunds couldn\u2019t speak English and presented Chinese passports instead of local driver\u2019s licenses, according to the report. One straw buyer sought refunds for more than 25 vehicles. A thousand buyers were linked to a single exporter.The probe also investigated money laundering in horse racing, where it didn\u2019t find much cause for concern, and in real estate. The chapters on real estate will be released in the coming days, Eby said. Meanwhile, the government is already preparing plans to more closely regulate the luxury car sector and review the sales-tax refund program, he said.Unclear SourcesStill, while the latest report cited some clear examples of illicit money in the sector \u2014 such as individuals with criminal records found to be principals of luxury car dealerships \u2014 much of it focused on transactions where the source of funds is unclear but not necessarily illegal.It said buyers use multiple, small international wire transfers to different accounts to buy cars \u2014 something that could be explained by China\u2019s capital controls, which limit foreign currency exchanges and withdrawals to US$50,000 a year. The report also cited one dealer describing how foreign students with no credit history and income obtain auto financing based on bank statements showing regular incoming wire transfers \u2014 an issue that may be one of undeclared income or very wealthy parents rather than unequivocal money laundering.Dealers also say customers in recent years have moved away from cash purchases to international payment methods, including wire transfers, WeChat and UnionPay \u2014 a shift that makes it harder to monitor the source of funds, according to one of the investigators.\u201cThese foreign credit cards are not transparent in any way,\u201d said Doug LePard, a former Vancouver police officer. \u201cThe money is coming from a foreign country.

Benchmark prices are down 8.7 per cent from their peak in mid-2018 and the number of homes sitting on the market has ballooned by nearly half, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Yet those awaiting a final reckoning \u2014 and the chance to buy a home on the cheap in this picturesque West Coast city \u2014 may be disappointed, according to Tamara Vrooman, chief executive officer of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union.Real estate has been our oil, in many ways. It's been the dominant factor in our regional economyTamara Vrooman, chief executive of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union \n \n\u201cWe see no evidence of a freefall,\u201d Vrooman, 50, said in an interview at the headquarters of Canada\u2019s largest credit union. \u201cWe have certainly seen a lot of sitting on the sidelines and wait-and-see, but we\u2019re also seeing signs that we might be at the trough.\u201dOutlying suburbs and southern Vancouver Island, favoured by families and those able to work remotely or start businesses, are still seeing growth, she said. Developers are also starting to assemble lots and buy land again. One Vancity client recently tried to buy a commercial building in Vancouver listed for $20 million, but lost \u2014 the property sold for $26 million within five days after getting seven offers, she said.Affordability IssueVrooman has a better insight than many: Vancity provides banking services for about a quarter of the people in the metropolitan area of 2.25 million. She\u2019s well aware of the economic challenges facing borrowers and potential homebuyers in a city where the benchmark home price is still more than $1 million. According to real estate website Zoocasa, only the top 2.5 per cent of income earners can afford to buy a house in Vancouver.\u201cWe still have a huge affordability issue, of course, where it is still out of reach for household incomes of $100,000 or $120,000,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right mix of housing.\u201dHousing for families, such as two- and three-bedroom townhouses with a small yard, aren\u2019t part of Vancouver\u2019s housing supply, she said. Cheap rentals are also difficult to come by, even with Vancity financing the development of 3,000 affordable rental units in the past year.\u201cWe still see affordability as the primary issue,\u201d she said.\u2018Brain Drain\u2019With Canada\u2019s rising household debt levels \u201cperilously high,\u201d more needs to be done to lift incomes that have stagnated for years within British Columbia\u2019s real estate fuelled economy, according to Vrooman.\u201cReal estate has been our oil, in many ways,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the dominant factor in our regional economy.\u201dThat has caused a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of talent within the region into the property market, depleting other industries that could offer high-paying jobs and counter any downturn from real estate.Nevertheless, Vancity has benefited from the real estate boom. During Vrooman\u2019s 11 years at the helm, the co-operative has boosted assets 62 per cent while advancing its long-standing objective of upending the big banks in Canada\u2019s third-largest city. The lender has 59 branches and 2,853 employees mostly in and around the Vancouver region.Hearts, MindsIt had $22.9 billion in assets at the end of 2018, when it posted $116.5 million of annual profit before taxes and distributions to the 534,000 members who own a stake in the co-operative. The credit union has added more than 25,000 members each year in the past five years, with about half aged 35 or under.\u201cWe\u2019re competing with them for the hearts and minds every day,\u201d Vrooman said of her competitors. \u201cWhen we gain market share, though, we gain it from the banks, and two in particular \u2014 TD and RBC, because they\u2019re the biggest ones.\u201dLike Canada\u2019s big banks, she\u2019s also seen a slowdown in mortgage lending amid more stringent rules and other measures in the last few years to slow B.C.\u2019s overheated housing market.\u201cWe have a speculation tax, we have a vacancy tax, we have a school tax \u2014 all of those are creating uncertainty,\u201d she said.Vancity has been countering the slowdown by focusing on mortgage renewals, capturing a 92 per cent retention rate for its home loans. The credit union is currently seeing 3 per cent to 4 per cent year-over-year growth in new mortgages, less than half the growth of three years ago.\u201cWe see it returning to what we call more normal market conditions,\u201d Vrooman said. \u201cWe see a slow but steady return to normal.\u201dWith assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Toronto housing market starts buying season with a bang, sales up 17%", "description": "Average selling price climbs 1.9% to $820,148", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-housing-market-begins-busy-spring-season-with-a-bounce?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cpt128-the-canadian-press-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 6, 2019 2:03 PM EDT", "content": "Toronto\u2019s housing market entered the busy spring property season with a bang, as sales surged 17 per cent in April compared with a year earlier and prices also pushed higher.The number of transactions totalled 9,042 units last month, compared with 7,744 units in April 2018, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Monday. On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales were up 11 per cent in April compared with March. The average selling price of a home climbed 1.9 per cent from a year ago, to $820,148.The rise in sales is an another indication Canada\u2019s biggest real estate market is stabilizing from a recent slump, though it\u2019s off the dizzying heights of a few years ago.

Bhaura noted, however, demand still outpaced increased supply, pointing to the \u201congoing housing supply issue\u201d in Toronto that could fuel even more price gains.\u201cThis suggests that market conditions continued to tighten,\u201d he said.Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, are up 3.2 per cent from a year ago, the fastest appreciation in more than a year.The sales gains in April were driven by the single-family home segment, while price increases were led by condos, according to the realtor group.

The sales office was \u201cmayhem\u201d as buyers and agents begged for units in that pricing sweet spot. That same week, Papailias went to another presale condo launch by CentreCourt Inc. and SmartREIT, which sold out in three days.

Prices across the city were up just half a per cent in March from a year ago compared, with a 7.2 per cent rise in condo prices.\u201cThere is a big challenge with low-rise, which is still suffering a lot.

That translates into about a 7 per cent decline in sales, they said.There is also evidence of a shift in business to private lenders who are not subject to the rules, known as B-20 and implemented by Canada\u2019s banking regulator.

The measures are disproportionately affecting first-time homebuyers, who normally account for between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the market, as well as cities that have more youthful demographics like Toronto and Vancouver, TD said.\u2018One-Size\u2019\u201cRight now it\u2019s a one-size-fits all type of policy, and borrowers differ in their ability to service their mortgage, and they\u2019re different in terms of their risks,\u201d Bushmeneva said in a phone interview.

That poses a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d as those markets are already \u201cseverely under-supplied,\u201d with current vacancy rates at just 1 per cent, the economists wrote.Toronto-Dominion joins fellow-lender Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, along with realtors and builder groups in calls for the government to revisit its B-20 rules.According to the note, Toronto-Dominion also forecasts:Housing starts to trend lower through 2020, as B-20 crimps market for new housing.New housing construction will be a drag on growth next year, though healthy job gains and robust population growth will provide a floor.Currently bank sees Canadian home prices stabilizing by mid-year and rising 4 per cent by end of 2020. However, if B-20 was immediately removed, nationwide sales and prices could be about 8 per cent and 6 per cent higher by end of 2020, equating to about $32,000 difference in average Canadian home price, with disproportionate impacts in Toronto, Vancouver.Removal of B-20 would represent a \u201csignificant near-term boost to housing activity, though at a longer-term cost of worsened affordability.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly shrinks as resource sector stalls", "description": "Falling resource production was the main culprit, with the mining and oil and gas sector down 1.6% \u2014 its sixth consecutive drop", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/update-1-canada-economy-unexpectedly-shrinks-in-feb-mining-and-rail-transport-weaker", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/miner.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 30, 2019 10:59 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy returned to its sluggish ways in February, with a drop in output that will reinforce expectations of a slow start to the year.Gross domestic product fell 0.1 per cent, taking back some of the 0.3 per cent gain in January in part due to poor weather, Statistics Canada said Tuesday from Ottawa.

While the oil and gas sector continued to show weakness, the big decline was in mining and quarrying outside of energy. That component fell 4.4 per cent, driven by reduced output of most types of metals.A tough winter in much of the country also played a role in the contraction, adding to the economy\u2019s woes.

The plan was to replace costly construction financing with cheaper debt after opening but business picked up slower than expected amid the new restrictions.

The amount of interest isn\u2019t disclosed, but Parq had deferred an interest payment by one month to April 30 and its ability to pay hinges on the company refinancing its debt, S&P said earlier this month when it downgraded Parq Holdings LP to CCC, eight notches below investment grade, from B-.\u201cWe still believe that, absent a debt recapitalization, the company will be unable to materially address its high fixed charges and financial sustainability,\u201d S&P said, adding there\u2019s a risk of a payment default or a debt restructuring within the next 12 months.Ottawa OwnerPrivately held PBC Group, an Ottawa-based real estate developer, is the majority owner of Parq with 63 per cent.

That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months.The numbers may bolster hopes that growth is stabilizing after its recent soft patch. Trump, speaking with reporters before departing on a trip on Air Force One, said the GDP numbers were \u201cfar higher than the high expectations.\u201d \nBank of Canada could resume hikes if data proves slowdown temporary: Poloz\nSlump in world trade is just as bad as the decline sparked by the dotcom crash, warn analysts\nThe IMF cut Canada\u2019s growth outlook \u2014 but Deloitte says its forecast is still too optimistic\nBut underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers\u2019 2 per cent objective.Even so, the data showing faster growth and tame inflation helped push Treasury yields lower Friday. U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components \u2014 inventories and trade \u2014 that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed\u2019s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation\u2019s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a \u201cgreat number,\u201d consumer spending \u201chas to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. \u201cWe think it will, but it\u2019s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.\u201dWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cWhile this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker \u2014 namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.\u201d \u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can\u2019t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed MeetingFed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday\u2019s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final\u00a0sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish.

Oil has provided some buoyancy, but Canada\u2019s domestic picture has been more cloudy. There is mounting concern about household indebtedness, home prices are dropping and growth practically ground to a halt in the final part of 2018. A Bank of Canada survey released Monday that showed softening business sentiment dented the loonie, dragging it down around 0.4 per cent on the day.While growth numbers for January were more upbeat and unemployment remains close to multi-decade lows, the central bank has become more circumspect. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz this month suggested that he is settling into a holding pattern on interest-rate policy. The global slowdown, coupled with a housing sector that is taking longer to adjust to tighter mortgage rules and higher rates, means the economy still needs the help of low borrowing costs, the BOC boss said.\u201cCanada\u2019s got to worry about an additional factor that the U.S. doesn\u2019t at this point, and that is the fact that our household sector is extremely leveraged,\u201d said Rai, who is based in Toronto. \u201cIt could prove to be a much more prolonged slowdown given that you may see households deleveraging.\u201dHe sees the loonie weakening to around $1.36 per greenback by the end of this year and $1.40 in 2020. It was at $1.3377 on Monday.Toronto-Dominion Bank also sees the Canadian currency coming under pressure, with currency strategist Mazen Issa pointing not only to risks from household debt but also potential spillover effects from international trade fights.\u201cWe\u2019re basically looking at a situation that is very difficult to find any positives for the Canadian dollar overall,\u201d said Issa. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s probably going to continue to get worse.\u201dNot all observers are so pessimistic though. Bank of Montreal\u2019s global head of foreign-exchange strategy, Greg Anderson, expects the loonie to rally to $1.30 per dollar by year end, while Scotiabank forecasts it will go to to $1.27.Eric Theoret at Scotiabank sees a weak greenback environment fuelling commodity-price gains and boosting Canada\u2019s terms of trade, and says there\u2019s room for improvement in the currency if crude prices continue to rise.\u201cIf oil prices keep moving the way they are, it should allow the Bank of Canada to withdraw some of the accommodation that they are currently providing,\u201d said Theoret.Even if oil recovers, RBC Wealth Management expects the Canadian dollar to trade around its current levels until mid-year, with some modest softness taking it to a range of $1.34 to $1.36 per dollar by year end. Laura Cooper, head of FX solutions and strategy at RBC Wealth, sees limited scope for oil to bolster the loonie because pipeline constraints are helping to maintain a price gap between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark price. She\u2019s also doubtful of any major shift from rate differentials, since both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are signaling extended tightening-cycle pauses.\u201cIn the absence of a catalyst coming from rate dynamics or commodity prices, we see the currency trading broadly sideways in coming months,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s business sentiment gauge turns negative and drops to lowest since 2016", "description": "Economic slowdown and trade tensions have begun to impact business confidence", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-business-sentiment-softens-amid-slowing-economy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/banks-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2019 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s recent economic slowdown and global trade tensions have begun to impact businesses confidence, according to a Bank of Canada survey.The Ottawa-based central bank\u2019s first-quarter survey of executives \u2014 which took place in February and March \u2014 showed softening expectations for sales along with a sharp decline in the number of companies reporting labour shortages.

The survey provides insight into everything from investment intentions to the amount of slack in the economy and inflation expectations, and Monday\u2019s report was almost universally negative.More businesses reported their sales growth decelerated over the past 12 months, while expectations for future sales remained depressed.The share of companies reporting at least some difficulty in meeting increased demand fell to 31 per cent, the lowest since 2015. Readings on labour shortages also weakened to multi-year lows, while inflation expectations showed a marked softening. About two-thirds of all executives surveyed expect inflation won\u2019t surpass 2 per cent over the next two years.One positive is investment and employment intentions remain robust, even though there was some softening for these questions as well.

He cited recent data \u2014 the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January \u2014 to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.\u201cThere are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.\u201dYield CurvePoloz\u2019s comments are the first since a segment of Canada\u2019s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada\u2019s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need \u2014 at least over time \u2014 for rates to move higher. He didn\u2019t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada\u2019s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term \u2014 unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Positive ToneIn his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy\u2019s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to \u201cpositive growth\u201d later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will \u201ceventually be completed.\u201d Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials \u201cthey need to make new investments,\u201d aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.\u201cWe only have to look back a few years for an example,\u201d said Poloz, \u201cfollowing the oil price collapse of 2015.\u201dHe also cited \u201cnumerous advantages\u201d beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth \u2014 including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a \u201cportfolio\u201d of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials \u2014 after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector \u2014 can \u201csee many areas of encouraging economic growth\u201d in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.\u201cThese data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cJudging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Canada admits it has a money laundering problem.

That inversion hasn\u2019t happened since 2007, at the start of the financial crisis sparked by a U.S. housing crash. The 10-year inflation-linked bond, meanwhile, offers a negative yield in real terms, after accounting for consumer prices.The so-called inverted yield curves in both the U.S. and Canada reflect concerns that a global economic slowdown will keep the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada from raising rates \u2014 and may even prompt a rate cut if it worsens. \nUh-oh, U.S. Treasury yield curve just inverted for the first time since 2007\nCanadian dollar could sink to record low of 62 cents as economy slides closer to recession, says David Wolf\n\u2018The Bank of Canada is on hold,\u2019 with little good news to be seen on the economic front\n\u201cA rate cut would require signs that the economy is declining,\u201d said Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada, in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg Friday. Still \u201cthe inverted yield curve is troubling. Inverted curves have often been accompanied by recession.\u201dYields on government bonds have fallen in recent weeks amid weakening economic data in Canada, including lower than expected growth in the last quarter of 2018. The Federal Reserve Wednesday tilted even more dovish and the German bond yield returned to zero Friday as Europe\u2019s largest economy weakens.\u201cSigns of a global slowdown are real,\u201d said Alexander, who has also worked at the Conference Board of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank. \u201cThis certainly puts the Bank of Canada on hold.\u201dInvestors are buying top-rated government securities in Canada as retail sales unexpectedly declined in January, reinforcing concerns that consumers may no longer be able to drive the economy with household debt at record levels and borrowers facing higher costs following five rate hikes by the Bank of Canada. Economists forecast growth of 1.5 per cent this year, down from 1.8 per cent in 2018, according to Bloomberg surveys.\u201cThe yield curve is the best economist out there\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be ignored, said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in an interview Monday with BNN Bloomberg.Canada DeteriorationWhile the inversion of the curve is a wider trend in developed markets from New Zealand to Germany, Canada\u2019s curve suggests that the outlook for its economy \u201chas deteriorated more than most,\u201d said Greg Gibbs, a founder of Amplifying Global FX Capital, in a note to investors. \u201cCanadian real long-term yields have fallen more abruptly than in the USA, into negative territory.\u201dThe yield on the government of Canada 10-year inflation-indexed bond has turned negative, Gibbs points out in his note.Canadian bond investors have been rewarded by the plunging yields, with an aggregate index of Canadian debt returning 4.1 per cent this year, compared with a 2.6 per cent gain for a comparable U.S. gauge, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.On HoldInvestors appear to be betting on a pause by the Bank of Canada for now. Toronto-Dominion earlier this month shifted its view and now expects the overnight rate to remain at 1.75 per cent through the end of 2020. That would mean Poloz has already made the last rate hike of his tenure, which ends in June 2020.If there is any move this year, it\u2019s more likely to be a cut, based on trading in the swaps market. Chances of a rate cut at the Bank of Canada meeting in September have risen to about 36 per cent, from 23 per cent a week ago, according to swaps rates. Traders assign close to a zero per cent chance of a hike by then. There is a 29 per cent chance of a rate cut at the July meeting.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "No quick exit to our economy\u2019s slow patch seen as today's retail sales and inflation numbers disappoint", "description": "Retail sales were the big disappointment, underscoring a broader trend of slowing consumption by households", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/economic-weakness-persists-in-canadas-inflation-and-retail-data", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/shopping.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 22, 2019 11:31 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy gave no sign of a quick exit from its current soft patch, with data released Friday showing a benign environment for price pressures and tepid consumer spending.Statistics Canada reported a small uptick in inflation from 15-month lows, to 1.5 per cent, but those numbers are still well below the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2 per cent target.

The Liberal government has seen higher-than-expected revenues and has hinted there will be new measures on skills training, housing, pharmaceutical coverage and support for seniors.None of it will sharply change the course of a government whose previous budgets have put windfalls toward social programs and transfers, while running deficits that steadily decline as a share of the economy. While Morneau has telegraphed the same will be true this year, the October vote that will decide if Trudeau gets a second mandate sharpens the focus on new spending. \nToday\u2019s federal budget could give the loonie a boost \u2014 but after that, things look murky\nFederal Budget will aim to make home-buying more affordable through supply, demand and regulation\nCanada\u2019s income tax rates have become uncompetitive, and the economy will pay the price\n\u201cThis is an election budget, it\u2019s safe to say,\u201d Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said in an interview. The lobby group, which represents chief executives at the country\u2019s top firms, has issued a warning about about fading competitiveness, but Hyder\u2019s expectations are low for any major measures there or on trimming the deficit. \u201cWe should have been saving, and paying down debt and deficit, during the good times,\u201d Hyder said.The budget arrives amid a cloudy outlook for the nation\u2019s economy. An oil shock last year stunted economic growth, with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz seen to be in a holding pattern on any new interest-rate hikes. Before Tuesday\u2019s budget, Morneau\u2019s most recent forecasts projected a deficit of $18.1 billion (US$13.6 billion) in the fiscal year that ends this month, followed by five years of declining deficits totalling $76.8 billion.The government has room to spend, however, without adding new taxes or ballooning the deficit. Revenue is coming in much stronger than expected, amid a red-hot labour market. Morneau has downplayed the significance of the numbers, but it nonetheless gives him some breathing room.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals have seen a dip in the polls amid allegations of judicial interference.\n\nAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press\n\nDespite that windfall, there\u2019s more red ink than Trudeau pledged to voters the first time around. The prime minister won power in 2015 on a platform that forecast a return to balance by now. The opposition Conservative Party regularly attacks him over the scale of his deficits, though they remain modest by global standards at 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product.\u201cWe expect the government will spend part of this windfall while protecting the bottom line,\u201d Scotiabank economists Jean-Francois Perrault and Rebekah Young wrote in a note to clients. They projected the deficit for the fiscal year that ends this month could plunge by $10 billion, to $7.7 billion, and fall to $12.2 billion in the next fiscal year, before major new spending kicks in.Skills TrainingOf the four key themes Morneau has been talking up so far, funding for skills training in particular will be welcomed by the private sector. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the government will unveil a kind of lifelong learning account for Canadian adults, modelled after a similar program in Singapore. Hyder supports the idea and expects the budget will highlight \u201cskills and the importance of preparing for the workforce of the future while you\u2019re currently in it.\u201dThat could include a move to make permanent a visa fast-track program for highly skilled workers, which cut processing time to two weeks from months-long waits previously, another business group said. \u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that that program will be made permanent in this year\u2019s budget,\u201d said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, representing tech firms. The program has been \u201cvery beneficial in order to bring over that one or two key individuals to build teams around.\u201d\n\nFederal Finance Minister Bill Morneau takes questions from children from the Toronto and Kiwanis Boys and Girls Club after putting on his new budget shoes for a pre-budget photo opportunity in Toronto on Thursday, March 14, 2019.\n\nChris Young/The Canadian Press\n\nOn housing, Morneau has stressed the need to maintain market stability while also making sure \u201cmillennials can see some optimism for them and their families,\u201d suggesting some kind of support for first-time buyers. That would come after the government tightened mortgage eligibility rules in an effort to cool off the housing market, amid fears of bubbles in cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with the risks in our housing market by looking at how we can ensure that it\u2019s stable,\u201d Morneau told reporters last month in Ottawa. \u201cWhat we want to do is ensure that people have a sense of the possibility for them and their families.\u201dThe budget will also likely offer a glimpse at the government\u2019s infrastructure spending, which has seen funding delayed and pushed well into the future. Once a key plank of Trudeau\u2019s fiscal plan, infrastructure spending is now a source of criticism for Trudeau, with the government accused of being slow in getting money out the door.Morneau has also said the government will \u201cmake sure that seniors feel a sense of optimism\u201d and that it will respond to a recent interim report on an expanded \u201cpharmacare\u201d program. Morneau has downplayed expectations in his party\u2019s centre-left coalition for a full national prescription drug program, saying instead he\u2019s looking to address the high cost of certain medicines in Canada\u2019s patchwork system and ensure coverage for all Canadians that need it.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Gary Shilling, Commentary", "title": "A recession is coming \u2014 and maybe a bear market, too", "description": "Gary Shilling: The recessionary indicators are numerous", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/a-recession-is-coming-and-maybe-a-bear-market-too", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/investing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 18, 2019 1:12 PM EDT", "content": "I first suggested the U.S. economy was headed toward a recession more than a year ago, and now others are forecasting the same. I give a business downturn starting this year a two-thirds probability.The recessionary indicators are numerous. Tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve that the central bank now worries it may have overdone. The near-inversion in the Treasury yield curve. The swoon in stocks at the end of last year. Weaker housing activity. Soft consumer spending. The tiny 20,000 increase in February payrolls, compared to the 223,000 monthly average gain last year. Then there are the effects of the deteriorating European economies and decelerating growth in China as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with that country.There is, of course, a small chance of a soft landing such as in the mid-1990s. At that time, the Fed ended its interest-rate hiking cycle and cut the federal funds rate with no ensuing recession. By my count, the other 12 times the central bank restricted credit in the post-Second World War era, a recession resulted. \nCanadian dollar could sink to record low of 62 cents as economy slides closer to recession, says David Wolf\nDavid Rosenberg: Don\u2019t let \u2018blockbuster\u2019 job numbers fool you, Canada is one rung away from recession\nCanada has two economies. Let\u2019s hope the government is paying attention to both\nIt\u2019s also possible that the current economic softening is temporary, but a revival would bring more Fed restraint. Policy makers want higher rates in order to have significant room to cut in the next recession, and the current 2.25 per cent to 2.50 per cent range doesn\u2019t give them much leeway. The Fed also dislikes investors\u2019 zeal for riskier assets, from hedge funds to private equity and leveraged loans, to say nothing of that rankest of rank speculations, Bitcoin. With a resumption in economic growth, a tight credit-induced recession would be postponed until 2020.\u201cRecession\u201d conjures up spectres of 2007-2009, the most severe business downturn since the 1930s in which the S&P 500 Index plunged 57 per cent from its peak to its trough. The Fed raised its target rate from 1 per cent in June 2004 to 5.25 per cent in June 2006, but the main event was the financial crisis spawned by the collapse in the vastly-inflated subprime mortgage market.Similarly, the central bank increased its policy rate from 4.75 per cent in June 1999 to 6.5 per cent in May 2000.\u00a0 Still, the mild 2001 recession that followed was principally driven by the collapse in the late 1990s dot-com bubble that pushed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index down by a whopping 78 per cent.The 1973-1975 recession, the second deepest since the 1930s, resulted from the collapse in the early 1970s inflation hedge buying of excess inventories. That deflated the S&P 500 by 48.2 per cent. The federal funds rate hike from 9 per cent in February 1974 to 13 per cent in July of that year was a minor contributor.The remaining eight post-Second World War recessions were not the result of major financial or economic excesses, but just the normal late economic cycle business and investor overconfidence. The average drop in the S&P 500 was 21.2 per cent.At present, I don\u2019t see any major economic or financial bubbles that are just begging to be pricked. The only possibilities are excess debt among U.S. nonfinancial corporations and the heavy borrowing in dollars by emerging-market economies in the face of a rising greenback. Housing never fully recovered from the subprime mortgage debacle. The financial sector is still deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis. Consumer debt remains substantial but well off its 2008 peak in relation to household income.Consequently, the recession I foresee will probably be accompanied by about an average drop in stock prices. The S&P 500 fell 19.6 per cent from Oct. 3 to Dec. 24, but the recovery since has almost eliminated that loss. A normal recession-related decline of 21.2 per cent \u2014 meeting the definition of a bear market \u2014 from that Oct. 3 top would take it to 2,305, down about 18 per cent from Friday\u2019s close, but not much below the Christmas Eve low of 2,351.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Why central banks \u2014 including Canada's \u2014 are finding it so hard to get interest rates back to 'normal' territory", "description": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz acknowledges he's getting heat over higher borrowing costs from Canadians themselves", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/why-central-banks-like-canadas-are-finding-it-hard-to-navigate-home", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 14, 2019 1:12 PM EDT", "content": "Central bankers have long been crafting analogies to explain what they do \u2014 think taking away the punch bowl.

Most economists expect the sluggishness to persist in the first six months of this year, before growth picks up steam later in 2019.The jobs increase largely reflects higher labor force numbers, rather than falling unemployment, due to rising participation rates and accelerating population growth over the past couple of years. Much of the increase in Canada\u2019s population comes from international working-age migrants. In an economy with more than half a million vacant jobs, many seem to be finding work.The labour force increased by 55,100 in February, and is up by 159,000 so far this year. Canada\u2019s jobless rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent, even with the employment gains, because more people were looking for work.The breakdown in the numbers was also positive, with 67,400 new full-time jobs offsetting a loss of 11,600 part-time positions.Even the wage picture is looking better. Annual average hourly gains accelerated to 2.3 per cent in February from 2 per cent a month earlier, with pay for permanent employees up 2.2 per cent, from 1.8 per cent previously.One weakness was total hours worked, which fell 0.1 per cent in February from a year earlier.With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "The spark set to ignite Canada\u2019s next big corporate credit shakeout looms as companies pile on too much debt", "description": "'Cheap loans, high leverage and an abundance of capital really for the last decade is the gasoline'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/pot-banker-infor-adds-restructuring-team-as-debt-shakeout-looms", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/lit-match.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2019 7:25 PM EST", "content": "Infor Financial Group Inc., an independent investment bank, is preparing for a major shakeout in corporate credit as Canadian companies pile on too much debt.After more than 10 years without a major corporate failure, banks are \u201caggressively\u201d expanding into corporate loans, adding to a debt pile built on the back of ultra-low interest rates, said Infor founding partner Neil Selfe.

Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country\u2019s second and fifth largest banks, bolstered provisions in the last fiscal quarter, citing a rise in corporate arrears among the reasons.Canadian companies\u2019 interest expenses almost doubled this decade to $10.8 billion (US$8.1 billion) at the end of the year from $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to government data. While interest revenues that companies get from their interest bearing investments were at $18.7 billion in the last quarter of 2018, the rate of interest expenses jumped three times faster than revenue from interest bearing investments.Credit to Canadian businesses rose in the last 12 months through January by 6.1 per cent to $2.18 trillion, while lending to households expanded 3.1 per cent and reached $2.16 trillion, according to Bank of Canada data. Lenders are expanding credit to companies even as the country\u2019s economic growth almost stalled in the last quarter of 2018 as consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing investment fell by the most in a decade, business spending dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.Business Ramp UpInfor is getting ready \u2014 it\u2019s hired veteran restructuring expert Paul Liebovitz, who is already advising publicly listed companies in the renegotiation of their debt facilities, Selfe said, declining to provide the name of the firm. Infor is also turning to pension funds and insurance companies to fund debtor-in-possession loans, a type of credit for distressed companies, said Selfe.\u201cThere were very few, if any DIP providers in Canada\u201d said Selfe. \u201cThis is one of the areas that we think is a ripe opportunity.\u201dWhile companies in the mining and oil & gas sectors have been in a downturn for several years, the restructurings could be expanded into some of the suppliers of those industries as well as services firms, said Selfe. Also, some \u2018veteran\u2019 services industries, or manufactured or sport or niche manufacturing industries, may also being forced to reorganize their balance sheet.\n\nInfor Financial Group founding partner Neil Selfe.\n\nNational Post files\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often very, very little left if they hit the wall. It\u2019s not like a mining company or an oil and gas company where at the end of the day you\u2019re left with a mine or an oil and gas facility,\u201d said Selfe. \u201cThe banks will do whatever they can to prop up those companies because in a blowup their recovery is very little.\u201dWhile Infor restructurings activity takes off, investment banks in Canada may continue to see a steady flow of mergers among the mid-size and small players in the Canadian cannabis industry, he said. For that to happen there should be a closing of the current gap between the values that \u201csmall players think they\u2019re worth and what the larger players are now willing to pick them up,\u201d he said.\u201cWe do think there\u2019s a few mid tier players that will still pick-up Canadian assets and we\u2019ll try to push into that top ten,\u201d said Selfe. So it\u2019s really the mid tier producers buying small tier producers.

That\u2019s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years, down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase.While a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices, it\u2019s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector. Consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing fell by the most in a decade, business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.The only thing that kept the nation\u2019s economy from contracting was a build-up in inventories as companies stockpiled goods.At the very least, the numbers suggest that heightened uncertainty \u2014 everything from the impact of higher interest rates to potential trade wars and oil-sector woes \u2014 has made a real impact on both consumer and business sentiment. The question now is what the weaker-than-expected data suggests about the economy\u2019s ability to rebound back to more normal growth levels. \nOops, Statistics Canada appears to have released today\u2019s key economic data almost half an hour early\nCanada\u2019s big banks feel the pain from the stock market\u2019s swoon\nOur debt-clogged world is just one shock away from tipping into recession\nWhat Canadians need to see in the Federal budget: David Rosenberg\nMost economists had been expecting the soft patch would come to an end by this spring and growth would accelerate closer to 2 per cent for the rest of the year. No one, however, expected the economy would need to come back from such a low point. The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest forecast, from January, is for annualized growth of 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, before the expansion accelerates back to above 2 per cent growth by next year.Until recently, the economy had been doing relatively well even in the face of higher rates. It grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3 per cent in 2017, and expanded at a healthy clip in the first half of last year \u2014 prompting the Bank of Canada to press ahead with higher borrowing costs.But even that strength had been overstated, with Statistics Canada revising down its estimates for first half growth to 2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. For all of 2018, the economy grew by 1.8 per cent \u2014 below the Bank of Canada\u2019s estimate for 2 per cent. Monthly data released Friday show the economy ended the year contracting, with December gross domestic product down 0.1 per cent.\u00a0The data suggest rising interest rates may be having a bigger impact on consumers than expected.

But one group of Apple contractors\u00a0finds another building, six miles away on Hammerwood Avenue in Sunnyvale, to be a more apt symbol.This building is as bland as the main Apple campus is striking. From the outside, there appears to be a reception area, but it\u2019s unstaffed, which makes sense given that people working in this satellite office \u2014 mostly employees of Apple contractors working on Apple Maps \u2014 use the back door. Workers say managers instructed them to walk several blocks away before calling for a ride home. Several people who worked here say it\u2019s widely referred to within Apple as a \u201cblack site,\u201d as in a covert ops facility.Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending machines to be understocked, and to have to wait in line to use the men\u2019s bathrooms. Architectural surprise and delight wasn\u2019t a priority here; after all, the contract workers at Hammerwood almost all leave after their assignments of 12 to 15 months are up. \nInside Google\u2019s shadow workforce, the \u2018second-class citizens\u2019 who do all the grunt work with few rewards\nApple warns employees to stop leaking information to the media \u2014 or face potential criminal charges\n\u2018Diversity is our strength\u2019: Tech leaders in Canada, U.S. unite against Trump travel ban\nAmazon eliminates bonuses, stock rewards for warehouse workers to help pay for wage hike\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for workers not to make it that long. According to 14\u00a0current and former contractors employed by Apex Systems, a firm that staffs the building as well as other Apple mapping offices, they operated under the constant threat of termination. \u201cIt was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time,\u201d says one former Hammerwood contractor, who, like most of the workers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with Apex. \u201cThere was a culture of fear among the contractors which I got infected by and probably spread.\u201dApex, not Apple, manages the workers it hires. Apple says it requires contracting firms to treat workers with \u201cdignity and respect.\u201d Following an inquiry from Bloomberg News, the company says, it conducted a surprise audit of the Hammerwood facility and found a work environment consistent with other Apple locations. \u201cLike we do with other suppliers, we will work with Apex to review their management systems, including recruiting and termination protocols, to ensure the terms and conditions of employment are transparent and clearly communicated to workers in advance,\u201d an Apple spokesperson says in a statement.Buddy Omohundro, Apex\u2019s chief services officer and general counsel, says in an email that his company strives to ensure it\u2019s creating the best possible work experience. \u201cApex provides multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns, both directly and anonymously, and to have those concerns addressed,\u201d he wrote.It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time.former Hammerwood contractor \n \nApex is one tiny part of a sprawling global network of staffing firms working with Apple; it is not even the only firm staffing the facility at Hammerwood Avenue. For Apple Maps alone, workers are spread across several locations in Silicon Valley, as well as in Austin, Tex.; London; the Czech Republic; and India, according to people who worked on the project. The operation involves thousands of contractors. At Hammerwood, the population has exceeded 250 at times, although the number fluctuates and Apple declined to give a current count.Places like Hammerwood undermine the mythology of Silicon Valley as a kind of industrial utopia where talented people work themselves to the bone in exchange for outsize salaries and stock options. A common perception in the Bay Area is that its only serious tech-labour issue is the high cost of living driven by the industry\u2019s obscene salaries. But many of the poorer residents work in tech, too. For decades, contractors and other contingent workers have served meals, driven buses and cleaned toilets at tech campuses. They\u2019ve also built circuit boards and written and tested software, all in exchange for hourly wages and little or no job security.In different forms, temporary labour as an alternative to full-time employment has grown across the U.S. economy. Companies in many industries now use staffing firms to handle work once done by full-time workers. The technology industry offers one of the starkest examples of how the groups\u2019 fortunes have diverged. While companies aren\u2019t required to disclose the sizes of their contingent workforces, there\u2019s ample evidence that tech companies use large numbers of contractors and temps. Last year, Bloomberg News reported that direct employees at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0Google accounted for less than half its workforce.\n\nGoogle employees walk off the job to protest the company\u2019s lenient treatment of executives accused of sexual misconduct on Nov. 1, 2018.\n\nBebeto Matthews / Associated Press file photo\n\nThe treatment of these workers is emerging alongside sexual harassment and military contracting as a principal target of the wave of tech worker activism that\u2019s been building over the past two years. When Google employees staged a walkout last November, many contingent workers didn\u2019t learn about it in advance because they don\u2019t have access to internal mailing lists. A month later, Googlers sent an open letter to the company\u2019s management demanding better working conditions for temporary workers, vendors and contractors.The Apple Maps operations staffed by Apex provide a dim view of contract work, according to current and former Apex workers. Some took jobs there with the hope of landing full-time work at Apple \u2014 a possibility they said Apex played up \u2014only to find the chances were small. As Apple has faced headwinds in recent months, it has further reduced the practice of converting any contract workers to full-time positions, according to a person familiar with Apple\u2019s operations.Other Apex workers took the job just to put Apple on their resume. Even that benefit was tenuous. Apex managers initially distributed specific wording they could include on their LinkedIn profiles referring to their employer as Apple, via Apex Systems. Last summer, Apex said they had to remove the word \u201cApple,\u201d describing their employer only as \u201cA Major Tech Company Via Apex Systems,\u201d according to two former employees.The restrictions were just one of many reminders of the contractors\u2019 inferior status, right down to the apple design on their ID badges. For direct employees, the apples were multi-colored; contractors got what one described as \u201csad grey.\u201d It\u2019s common for companies to distribute different badges to contractors, a practice that discontented workers across the industry have seized on as evidence of a caste system.\u00a0Amber Lutsko, who worked for Apple through Apex in 2017 and 2018, described an opening-day pep talk that aimed to make her feel both honored and excluded. \u201c\u2018You work at Apple now! You have made it!\u2019\u201d she recalls being told. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not allowed to use the gym.\u2019\u201d\n\nA person walks toward the Sunnyvale office building said to be an Apple satellite office.\n\nDavid Paul Morris / Bloomberg\n\nThe companies of Silicon Valley have created vast fortunes with far fewer employees than the corporate behemoths that came before them. In part, this is because you can replicate software infinitely in a way you can\u2019t with, say, a Model T. But the tech industry was also an early adopter of offloading core functions to contract workers. Tech was quick\u00a0to embrace contractors because of rapid advancements requiring constant adjustments in the composition of the workforce, according to Louis Hyman, author of the 2018 book \u201cTemp.\u201d All those changes helped nurture Silicon Valley\u2019s ideology of flexibility and speed, first in hardware, then in software and business operations. Hyman quotes a 1993 issue of Apple\u2019s internal magazine that describes the transition away from direct employees to contractors and outsourcing firms as both a \u201cpredictable evolution\u201d and \u201cthe future.\u201dConflict is inevitable in a two-tiered workforce. As far back as the 1990s, Microsoft Corp. contractors challenged their employment status in court and attempted to unionize. In 2014 a group of Microsoft bug-testers won the right to bargain with their employer, a staffing agency called Lionbridge Technologies Inc. Within a few years, Lionsbridge had eliminated all their jobs.Apple, which has about 130,000 full-time employees, also accepts workers from about three dozen staffing firms, according to OnContracting, a website providing market information to staffing companies. Contracting firms work on iTunes and server infrastructure, handle customer support, and select articles for Apple News. Apex, the largest division of ASGN, a staffing company based in suburban Los Angeles, has provided Apple with a steady stream of mapping technicians, whose jobs consist of checking to make sure that Apple\u2019s software is drawing roads in the right places, or responding to reports of inaccuracies in existing maps.They\u2019re largely in their early- to mid-20s, and have often just graduated from college. Wages are generally about US$25 an hour, which some workers consider generous and others see as stingy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median hourly wage for mapping technicians nationwide was $20.84, while the median per-hour rate for the same jobs in California was $30.61.Apex employees have access to health insurance, although the premiums are high enough that some people opt not to take it. Because the workforce is young, Apex workers often stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance.The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they'd made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The 'Oh you didn't make it through training, please give us your badge now'.Amber Lutsko, former Apple contractor \n \nApex has also suddenly changed aspects of employment. In November, it cut the maximum amount of paid sick time employees could take annually from 48 hours to 24 hours, saying the policy would go into effect in two days, according to two current employees and an internal email viewed by Bloomberg. The email, which Apex workers received on a Thursday afternoon, inspired a rare moment of collective action. A group of over a dozen workers said they had suddenly fallen ill, and left,\u00a0according to one current Apex employee who participated in the protest.\u201cAt all times, Apex has provided as much paid sick leave as required by applicable law,\u201d says Omohundro, adding that the company worked to find exceptions in individual cases.Many Apex employees first heard about the company through LinkedIn. The company trawls the website for people with proficiency in skills for mapmaking like geographic information systems or geography, then messages them repeatedly. Lutsko had worked as an archaeologist and was between jobs in 2017 when, as she describes it, she basically gave in. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty aggressive, so it was easy to take the job,\u201d she says.At the beginning of the interview process, Apex doesn\u2019t mention the company where people will work. But the revelation can tip wavering candidates over the edge. \u201cThey said it was with Apple \u2014 they were super hush-hush originally \u2014 and I was like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019,\u201d says a former Apex worker who started in 2017. \u201c\u2018That will be on my resume? Bang!\u2019\u201dThey said it was with Apple \u2014 they were super hush-hush originally \u2014 and I was like, 'Oh my God! That will be on my resume? Bang!'former Apex worker \n \nThe secrecy just made the job seem sexier. Many Apex workers assumed discretion was required because Hammerwood had some connection to self-driving cars. Their own work turned out to be drudgery. Still, they gossiped about the mysterious group of direct Apple employees who also worked on the site. They never knew for sure what those people were up to, since they say\u00a0managers at Apex kept them from communicating with\u00a0Apple employees unless it was necessary to do their immediate jobs. One former Apex worker says the contractors weren\u2019t allowed to use the bathrooms on the direct employees\u2019 side of the building.Complaints about the bathrooms were common. Lines formed outside the men\u2019s rooms, especially around lunchtime, according to former employees. (Because the workforce was predominantly male, the women\u2019s rooms had ample capacity.) Anonymous complaints about inadequate facilities were scrawled on white boards around the office. Twice in 2017, Hammerwood workers filed complaints against Apple with the state\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA. Apple told Cal/OSHA it had examined the situation and determined it was in compliance with the law. There was no mention of Apex workers being discouraged from using certain bathrooms, according to records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request. The agency did not pursue the issue.The working environment was uncomfortable\u00a0in other ways, according to current and former contractors. Apex managers sometimes broke up unauthorized water-cooler socializing. Several workers say their managers would get notifications if their workstations were idle for too long. \u201cBeing monitored like that is super dehumanizing and terrifying,\u201d says one former Apex mapping technician.If Apex seemed not to trust its workers, the feeling was mutual. They described a hiring process that was misleading in several ways. For one, Apex failed to explain the one-year assignments started with several weeks of training followed by a test, many say. Anyone who didn\u2019t pass was terminated immediately. The company recruited nationwide, so some workers showed up in California, signed leases in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and lost their only source of income within a matter of weeks.\n\nApple\u2019s 175-acre Cupertino, Calif. headquarters.\n\nJustin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nThere are no reliable numbers on how common such firings were; Omohundro says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of employees complete their assignments. But they loomed large even for those who passed the test. Lutsko says watching colleagues suddenly lose their jobs soured her on her new employer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle the arbitrariness of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cThe starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they\u2019d made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The \u2018Oh you didn\u2019t make it through training, please give us your badge now.\u2019\u201dLutsko quit before her contract was up. The LinkedIn messages from Apex recruiters persisted. This was common. Two people who Apex had fired said the company periodically pitches them on jobs. \u201cYou got rid of me because of my quote-unquote performance, and every three months I get these emails,\u201d says one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting, honestly.\u201dLike any group of people in shared circumstance, workers at Hammerwood bonded. Several former contractors say it was fun to be around with people their own age, and say the odd atmosphere only made them closer. Because many of them were young, new to the area, and not making enough money to live on their own, they ended up pooling resources to rent apartments or houses nearby.Many people simply moved to similar contracting jobs with other tech firms once their positions at Apple end, so their homes ended up having a mixture of Facebook, Google and Uber contractors. Several people described the geographic information systems contracting workforce almost as if it were a resource the big tech companies shared. People who left Apple would join the GIS staff at another company and find it was staffed primarily by Apex veterans.Those who left Apple often say their lives improved. Facebook\u2019s management put signs up around campus reading \u201cContractors Are People Too,\u201d and contingent workers participated in on-campus arts and crafts activities. Google paid more than competitors and let everyone use the gym, says Nick Wilson, who worked at Apple through Apex, then worked at Facebook, and is now a contractor doing mapping work at Google.Moving between companies didn\u2019t feel like advancement, says Wilson. \u201cNone of the skills I learned at Apple could be carried over,\u201d he says, adding that his managers were indifferent to any attempts by employees to distinguish themselves. \u201cThere were many people who took initiative and made things, increased the efficiency. They weren\u2019t rewarded in any way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were people who had abandoned any hope. They\u2019d come in late, leave early, and just do nothing all day. They were treated the same as everyone else.\u201d (Both Lutsko and Wilson declined to discuss the exact nature of their jobs or the building at which they worked, citing their nondisclosure agreements.)\n\nA man uses his security pass to open a door to the non-descript facility said to be an Apple satellite office.\n\nDavid Paul Morris / Bloomberg\n\nThe mood at Hammerwood dimmed late last year, after the changes in benefits and after Apex suddenly fired about two dozen people, according to two current Apex employees. One described the workplace as depressing and quiet, with everyone on edge. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of being too social because they might see that as not working hard enough,\u201d he says. \u201cApex handles all terminations in a sensitive and confidential manner,\u201d says Omohundro. \u201cThe company does not share the details of employee terminations, regardless of whether they are for cause or not for cause.\u201dActivists associated with the burgeoning labour movement in the tech industry say the contracting workforce is ripe for organization, but acknowledge it\u2019s been challenging to organize white-collar workers. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept,\u201d says Yana Calou, an organizer at Coworker.org. Information workers have been more reticent than security guards and cafeteria workers to confront tech companies because they\u2019re angling for full-time work, says Calou. \u201cI think there\u2019s the tiny idea of, \u2018I\u2019ll be the exception that squeezes through.\u2019 \u201dThat feeling eventually wears off. One former Apex worker, a 32-year-old who lives in the maid\u2019s quarters of a house with eight roommates, says years of uncertainty have left him worn out. \u201cHow are you supposed to plan for your future if your job has an expiration date?\u201d he says. He\u2019s a California native who moved to San Francisco over a decade ago, got a master\u2019s degree, and internalized Silicon Valley\u2019s brand of optimism. But that evaporated at Apple\u2019s so-called black site. \u201cIt sounds good when you say you work at Apple, but when you\u2019re not being paid the same amount, and you\u2019re not treated the same way, it gets old quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t just hire someone and give them a stake in the company.\u201d\u2014 With assistance from Josh Eidelson and Mark GurmanBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada unexpectedly gains almost 67,000 jobs as private-sector hiring hits record", "description": "A sign of strength in an economy facing several other headwinds", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-job-market-surges-on-record-private-sector-hiring", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/jobs2.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 8, 2019 11:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s job market began 2019 with an unexpected employment surge driven by jobs for youth in services and record private-sector hiring, a sign of strength in an economy facing several other headwinds.Employment increased by 66,800 in January, Statistics Canada said Friday from Ottawa. That was driven by a 99,200 gain in services, which offset falling employment in goods producing industries. The gains were almost evenly split between full-time and part-time positions.The picture is much stronger than anyone expected in an economy hit by stresses in the oil sector, weakening housing markets, volatility in global financial markets and waning consumer confidence. The report could ease some concerns about the extent of a current soft patch. Economists were forecasting only a 5,000 employment increase in January. \nGet analysis of today\u2019s figures by Kevin Carmichael\nEven with the gains, Canada\u2019s jobless rate jumped to 5.8 per cent last month, from 5.6 per cent in December. But the reason for the increase was more people looking for work \u2014 a sign of strength that could indicate the jobs market is pulling new workers into the labor force. That could give the economy more room to run without fuelling wage pressures.The labour force increased by 103,700, the biggest one-month increase since 2009. The increase was led by a 60,500 increase in the number of youth joining the jobs market. Youth \u2014 people aged 15 to 24 \u2014 also led the employment gains, with a 52,800 increase.The jump in January brought employment gains over the past 12 months to 327,200, the biggest year-over-year gain since 2017.Private SectorAnother positive was a shift away from self-employment. The number of people employed by the private sector jumped by 111,500, the biggest one-month gain on record in data going back to 1976. The number of self-employed fell by 60,700.Ontario, with an employment gain of 41,400, led the job surge among provinces.There continues to be some weaknesses in the numbers.

On average, about 2.4 per cent of shares of the six biggest Canadian banks is held in short-interest positions as of the end of January, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Vindication for those shorts appears some way off for now. The eight-member S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index has tread water for about two years. It gained about 3.3 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent increase in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and a 4.4 per cent gain in the U.S. KBW Bank Index.Canadian bank executives have already been conveying their expectations for slower growth this year.Wealth ManagementToronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s Teri Currie, who oversees the domestic banking division at Canada\u2019s largest bank by assets, expects \u201cmid-single digit\u201d growth this year in residential secured lending, which includes amortizing home-equity credit lines and mortgages.\u201cIn today\u2019s context it\u2019s sending a strong statement that the investments that we\u2019ve made are going to pay off in relatively good growth,\u201d she said in a Jan. 22 interview.Executives at rival banks are expecting domestic mortgage growth to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2019, when the country\u2019s economic expansion is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent.Investor David Baskin, whose Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion, said he\u2019d rather banks focus on wealth management. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for the banks to grow their mortgage business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the juice is.\u201dBusiness LendingSteve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7.5 billion, said the banks are countering the slowdown in residential lending with growth in business loans \u2014 something that makes Belisle a bit uneasy.

The economy is expected to rebound after that on strong job creation and business spending, with policy makers saying interest rates will still likely move higher over time.Output from the energy industry fell 0.6 per cent, Statistics Canada said. Lower production of petroleum and coal also drove a 0.5 per cent decline in manufacturing in November, the third drop in four months. Wholesaling fell by 1.1 per cent led by machinery and equipment, and construction fell for the sixth straight month to the lowest since the middle of 2017.Tumbling prices for Alberta oil late last year led the provincial government to impose production cuts that began in January. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are facing pressure before elections this year to develop stalled pipelines and send crude overseas rather than accept lower prices in the U.S. market.Retail spending remained weak in November, with a 0.3 per cent decline led by a 2 per cent drop in car sales.

She wants Toronto-Dominion to be No. 1 in all areas of banking, and she maintains the company\u2019s No. 4 position for these hybrid home loans pitched as mortgage substitutes doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201cOur goal is to be the undisputed leader in all categories of Canadian banking,\u201d Currie said in an interview last week at the Toronto headquarters. \u201cWe are below our embedded growth opportunity in that product in particular, so I continue to feel comfortable that on a relative basis we\u2019ll have pretty good growth.\u201d \nToronto-Dominion Bank sees up to 10% growth next year after earnings beat forecasts\nTop-performing hedge fund is shorting Canadian banks on all the usual suspects \u2014 and something even more worrying\nMortgage growth will be flat or in low-single digits for \u2018foreseeable future\u2019: CIBC CEO\nTD Bank nabs top spot for stock sales, M&A in mixed year for deals\nCanada\u2019s economy is cooling after years of growth fuelled by real estate investment and consumer borrowing, and as higher interest rates and regulations bite into the housing market. Such a backdrop, along with near-record household debt levels, is making policymakers skittish about borrowing burdens.The government\u2019s Financial Consumer Agency of Canada targeted home-equity credit lines in a report this month, noting that about a quarter of Canadians with such debt are paying only interest. Over the past 15 years, HELOCs have been the largest contributor to household debt outside of mortgages.That has investor David Baskin worried about government stepping in with more rules, bringing uncertainty to banks that have profited from this lending.\n\nTD\u2019s Teri Currie: \u201cOur goal is to be the undisputed leader in all categories of Canadian banking.\u201d\n\nGalit Rodan / Bloomberg\n\n\u201cHELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealots,\u201d said Baskin, whose firm Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think they are a huge issue in Canada as long as rates are low and the loan-to-value ratios are reasonable, which they usually are.\u201dToronto-Dominion has two types of HELOCs, and while the bank has seen little growth in its non-amortizing product, another offering introduced four years ago as a HELOC-mortgage hybrid has seen rapid growth. Those loans jumped 33 per cent last fiscal year to $44.1 billion, surpassing the overall size of the older product.HELOCs have become something of a hot-button issue with the debt zealotsDavid Baskin, Baskin Wealth Management \n \nThe bank has been playing catchup to others that have long offered such hybrid loans, and Currie\u2019s effort is more designed to recapture lost business from customers who turned to rivals for those loans instead of an aggressive push for new clients. In the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, 90 per cent of new HELOCs went to existing customers.The growth helped Toronto-Dominion post 10 straight months of market-share growth and post record profit in its Canadian retail business, a 10 per cent jump unmatched by domestic competitors.\u201cThat outperformance really helped us in 2018,\u201d she said.Toronto-Dominion is likely to increase its home-loans portfolio by \u201cmid single digits\u201d in 2019, after last year\u2019s six per cent growth rate, according to Currie.Currie said she\u2019s comfortable with the risks to the bank and its customers, noting that a \u201clarge majority\u201d of its borrowers make principal repayments regularly in those amortizing loans.Other priorities include gaining more business from business credit cards and mutual funds. Toronto-Dominion has added training for investment advisers in its branches to help them improve customer conversations \u2014 and the bank\u2019s No. 2 standing in funds.The overall strategy under Currie, who has headed Canadian banking for three years, hasn\u2019t deviated much as the bank continues to push extended branch hours and convenience. Still, the bar to poach customers remains high.\u201cThey\u2019re basically as good as the rest,\u201d Baskin said, adding that taking market share is tough. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult because of the size of the Canadian market for any of the banks to gain a huge advantage over the other banks in Canada: it\u2019s entrenched customers, the market is pretty split up and there\u2019s a lot of inertia.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Stress tests on private lenders not being considered, Morneau says", "description": "Finance Minister said he's not considering any additional regulations to address the growth of private mortgage lenders", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/stress-tests-on-private-lenders-not-being-considered-morneau-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 28, 2019 3:54 PM EST", "content": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he\u2019s not considering any additional regulations to address the growth of private mortgage lenders.\u201cI\u2019m not currently considering any stress tests on private mortgage lenders,\u201d Morneau told reporters in Ottawa.

In a background document released in November, the ministry touted the economic benefits of adding 10,000 housing starts a year, an amount builders estimate would bring supply closer to demand.Supply side measures are seen as critical to restoring affordability in some of Canada\u2019s largest cities like Toronto, where prices have doubled since 2010. They would also ease pressure on policy makers to implement demand curbs that are seen as unnecessarily disruptive. \nCanada considers applying mortgage stress test rules to private lenders, sources say\nIn Canada\u2019s housing slowdown, Vancouver proves to be the weakest link\nPolicy decisions, interest rates slowed the real estate market, and they\u2019re needed for a rebound\n\u201cWe have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable cost,\u201d Clark said in a telephone interview, describing the affordability issue as a \u201ccrisis.\u201dThere is already growing concern that tighter mortgage regulations and other recent changes may have overshot, given last year\u2019s plunge in transactions. Demand measures are blunt instruments that apply to all markets regardless of affordability, and disproportionately affect low-income households and youth. Supply measures, in comparison, allow markets to continue growing, albeit at a more sustainable pace.We have to remove the barriers and the red tape that are getting ahead of housing being built at a more affordable costSteve Clark, Ontario housing minister \n \nToronto, along with Vancouver on the Pacific coast, has the lowest price elasticity of any urban market in Canada, meaning supply is the most out of sync with demand, according to a report last year from the federal housing agency.Developers agree. It takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association. The group estimates the GTA needs 50,000 new units a year to meet projected demand, but only about 40,000 are being built on average.\u201cThe issue in our view for the sharp rise in prices and the affordability issue fundamentally is the supply side not being able to adjust quickly enough to demand,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cSo a big part of the solution is on the supply side. Except you have to be more patient, because it takes a while.\u201d He said Clark\u2019s proposals \u201d are the right types of measures\u201d to ensure market imbalances get addressed more quickly.Infrastructure DelaysIt\u2019s unclear how Clark\u2019s reforms would affect one major contributor to supply bottlenecks: delays to infrastructure projects such as highways and sewer systems. The minister\u2019s proposed changes to the growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the swath of cities surrounding Toronto that\u2019s home to a quarter of Canada\u2019s population, deal more with speeding up development approvals and updating zoning and intensification targets, rather than streamlining infrastructure regulations that are seen as excessive and unpredictable.\n\nIt takes about a decade and as many as 52 different reports, studies, checklists and plans to complete a development project in Toronto, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association.\n\nGraeme Roy/The Canadian Press\n\nThe previous government\u2019s focus on policy ideas just ended up \u201cgrinding things down to a halt,\u201d said Joe Vaccaro, chief executive officer at the Ontario Home Builders\u2019 Association.

More than four years later, he\u2019s still waiting.\u201cIf you can\u2019t flush a toilet, you can\u2019t build a home,\u201d Rabeau said by phone, adding the expected project completion date is now 2026 at the earliest.After early signals the project would be approved, environment ministry officials told Rabeau in late 2016 there were some outstanding issues concerning the duty to consult indigenous groups. Discussions between these groups, the provincial government and York Region are ongoing, according to a ministry spokesman.The delay is typical of a broader problem with building infrastructure in the GTA. \u201cWe\u2019re growing at a fairly rapid rate, and we\u2019ve got this conundrum that infrastructure has to go through quite a complex approval process,\u201d James McKellar, a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University, said in a phone interview. \u201cOur ability to bring infrastructure online in a timely way just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dMichael Fenn, a former Ontario deputy minister and a visiting fellow at the Ivey Business School\u2019s Lawrence National Centre, says housing should be given particular emphasis when it comes to infrastructure development. \u201cKeeping housing of a variety of types affordable and available is crucial to the economic success\u201d of the GTA and the country generally, he said.Clark acknowledges housing supply is a \u201cvery complex problem,\u201d and he stopped short of saying the environment minister should approve the York sewage project.

After five interest rate increases since mid-2017, markets are now anticipating the central bank will have no more than one more rate increase lined up before pausing indefinitely.Unsettled HousingOne issue the Bank of Canada has been monitoring closely is the economy\u2019s sensitivity to higher rates, particularly in housing, where the the increased borrowing costs have led to a a slumping activity in major markets like Toronto and Vancouver.

Mylonas says the surge in household debt combined with rising interest rates will push the Canadian economy into recession, even while the U.S. economy continues to grow.I think we're just on the precipice of embarking on a serious recessionJim Mylonas, global macro strategist at BCA Research \n \n\u201cI think we\u2019re just on the precipice of embarking on a serious recession,\u201d Mylonas said in an interview from Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.\u201dFor Mylonas, the irony is that surprisingly strong growth in the U.S. this year may push Canada over the edge. The expansion will force the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to raise rates, he said. The debt-laden Canadian consumer is ill-equipped to handle higher borrowing costs, unlike their U.S. counterparts who dialled back borrowing following the housing crash a decade ago. \n\u2018Everybody\u2019s in the dark\u2019: How the U.S. government shutdown is starting to hurt Canada\nThe number of Canadians finding it tough to make ends meet is going up\nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: The latest charts that matter most to the Bank of Canada\nFor Mylonas, the good news in the U.S. may be bad news for Canada.\u201cIf the U.S. economy is doing relatively well and the Fed is raising rates, it\u2019s very hard for the Bank of Canada to just sit on hold and not follow the Fed,\u201d Mylonas said. \u201cWe\u2019re now at the point where the Bank of Canada is going to be flirting with triggering the next recession if it hasn\u2019t already.\u201dIf Mylonas is right, it would be the first time since 1951 that Canada slipped into a recession without the U.S. also contracting.Canada\u2019s economic fortunes have always been tightly linked to its southern neighbour, the destination for about third quarters of its exports. The U.S. economy has reduced its imbalances after sparking the worst credit crisis in almost a century, led by a plunge in real estate. In Canada, which largely avoided the crash, corporations and consumers have been piling on debt ever since, Mylonas said.The debt to disposable income ratio in Canada rose to 175 per cent at the end of September, from 137 per cent in 2006, before the start of the financial crisis. By contrast, U.S. household debt to disposable income was below 100 per cent as of September, the lowest since 2001, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even at its recent peak, the U.S. ratio never topped 140 per cent.\u201cIn that 10-year period where the U.S. was on a diet, getting healthy, Canada was binge eating junk food, which is debt,\u201d Mylonas said, adding a medical analogy. \u201cEventually you go to the doctor and the doctor says, \u2018sorry, you gotta cut the junk food.\u2019 That\u2019s painful.\u201dCanada\u2019s housing market is already showing early signs of fatigue, with home sales declining last year to the lowest since 2012, according to Canadian Real Estate Association. The number of consumers seeking debt relief jumped 5.1 per cent in November from a year earlier, the Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy reported on Jan. 4.\u201cIf debt to disposable income is going to go from 180 to 130, then the recovery is going to look a lot more like the U.S. one, so shallow and long,\u201d said Mylonas.No RecessionTo be sure, most economists and the Bank of Canada aren\u2019t calling for a recession any time soon. The chances of a recession over the next 12 months is about 20 per cent, according to a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts released Jan. 11. Earlier this month, the central bank cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent, while raising its estimate for 2020 to 2.1 per cent. The chances of a U.S. recession is slightly higher, at 25 per cent, based on 49 estimates.Investors certainly aren\u2019t behaving as if a contraction is imminent. The Canadian dollar has gained the most among G-10 currencies this year, while the main equity gauge has jumped 7 per cent, the best start to a year since 1980.Traders aren\u2019t banking on an imminent hike by Poloz, who worked at BCA Research in the 1990s. Chances of an interest rate increase by May sit at about 30 per cent, according to trading on futures contracts.\u201cIf the Bank of Canada is not raising in line with the Fed, the reason it\u2019s not raising is probably rooted in bad news,\u201d such as weak economic growth, said Mylonas. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then my thesis for Canada will play out sooner than most think.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg and Kristine OwramBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "Top-performing hedge fund is shorting Canadian banks on all the usual suspects \u2014 and something even more worrying", "description": "Outside the financial sector, 80% of Canadian companies aren't generating enough cash to support their businesses, says Crescat", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/a-top-performing-hedge-fund-is-shorting-canada-banks-on-housing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/banks-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 18, 2019 9:21 AM EST", "content": "A small U.S. hedge fund that was a top performer last year is shorting Canadian banks.Crescat Capital sees the Canadian economy heading for recession as the housing market buckles.

That put the company among the top performers in a year in which the industry saw its biggest loss since 2011, declining 4.1 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.The country\u2019s biggest lenders are Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, along with Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada. Costa declined to name the banks Crescat was shorting. Representatives for Canada\u2019s six biggest banks didn\u2019t immediately comment or declined to comment.Crescat\u2019s short comes amid long-standing warnings from economists, investors and even the Bank of Canada about elevated consumer debt, which was driven higher by a decades-long housing boom. Canada\u2019s ratio of household debt to income has been hovering at about 175 per cent for the past two years, compared with a peak of about 134 per cent in the U.S. at the height of its housing bubble in 2007.Now Canada\u2019s housing market is beginning to cool. Sales plunged 32 per cent in Vancouver last year and 16 per cent in Toronto amid rising interest rates, stricter mortgage rules and new taxes.\u201cChina is in the process of reversing its key role as a driver of global economic growth,\u201d the 29-year-old Costa said. \u201cCountries like Canada and Australia, and their respective housing markets, are the economies most vulnerable in this scenario.\u201dMeanwhile, Crescat calculates that about 80 per cent of Canadian non-financial stocks have been cash-flow negative in the past 12 months, which he measures as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.That may be inflated by the the large numbers of \u201czombie\u201d companies on Canadian stock exchanges, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines as those 10 years and older and whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to cover interest payments on their debts. In a September study, Deloitte found 16 per cent of public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its sister Venture Exchange are considered zombies, compared with 10 per cent globally.Cash flow in the energy sector may have been hammered by a slump in crude prices in the past year.But Costa said even if he excludes energy and materials stocks, 70 per cent of Canadian stocks have still lost money on a free cash-flow basis. If you consider only non-financial stocks with a market value of more than $100 million, the share is still more than 50 per cent, he said.\u201cHow is it sustainable for companies that generate no cash to continue to employ people?\u201d Costa said. \u201cMany of these troubled companies would be bankrupt under tighter monetary conditions.\u201dPrevious ShortsThe country\u2019s biggest lenders could face troubles on both the housing and corporate fronts, according to Costa.At their peak last year, the six largest banks, traded at an average of 1.9 times book value, a similar valuation to U.S. banks prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, according to Costa. He expects that to drop to 0.7 times book value or so, where U.S. banks were trading post-financial crisis.Other investors have recommended shorting Canadian financials on a looming housing correction in the past, including Steve Eisman, who predicted the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse.And Canadians bank stocks have largely defied naysayers as the country\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered near records lows amid steady growth \u2014 until recently. The S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks Index slumped 11 per cent last year amid market global volatility, the biggest decline since 2008.\u201cMost of these banks are off their highs and have just started to break down,\u201d Costa said.With assistance from Doug Alexander and Brandon Kochkodin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joanna Ossinger", "title": "Goldman says rich people will drag down the U.S. economy this year", "description": "The stock-market sell-off is going to be a significant drag on the U.S. economy as wealthy households feel its impact, Goldman Sachs says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/goldman-says-rich-people-will-drag-down-the-u-s-economy-by-spending-less", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/tiffany.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2019 12:29 PM EST", "content": "The stock-market sell-off is going to be a significant drag on the U.S. economy this year as wealthy households feel its impact, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Lower equity prices could take half a percentage point off U.S. gross-domestic product growth in 2019, with overall tighter financial conditions restricting expansion by around 1 percentage point, Goldman economist Daan Struyven wrote in a note Tuesday.

Of course, if economies weather the latest challenges, policymakers may need to rethink anew. \nPhilip Cross: Central bankers can blame themselves for undermining their political \u2018independence\u2019\nIn the Age of Trump, central banks are only one populist uprising away from losing cherished independence\n\u2018I\u2019m not thrilled\u2019: Trump blasts Fed\u2019s rate hikes, trespassing on central bank\u2019s independence\nBloomberg Economics\u2019 produces a quarterly review of top central banks; here are several. We outline the issues they face in 2019 and how they might respond.U.S. Federal ReserveCurrent federal funds rate (upper bound): 2.5 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: 3 per cent.The Fed spooked markets at the end of 2018 with a projection for two rate hikes in 2019, based on a more optimistic outlook for the economy than investors held. Policymakers pointed to forecasts of continued strong growth and jobs gains, while investors fretted over slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war. Contributing to the unease, President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Fed Chairman Powell out of frustration over the Fed\u2019s gradual tightening campaign.Powell has since dialled back his message, assuring markets he would be flexible and patient. Many Fed watchers now believe U.S. policymakers are unlikely to raise rates before June unless data surprises to the upside.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cThe Fed\u2019s communication campaign preaching policy patience calmed the markets down. Yet, just a little patience will not alter the Fed\u2019s hiking bias. The real fed funds rate barely crossed into positive territory in the fourth quarter after sitting in the red since the Great Recession. There is ample room for the Fed to continue removing policy accommodation, especially if the pace of core inflation picks up above the central bank\u2019s target. We expect two rate hikes in 2019.\u201d \u2014 Yelena Shulyatyeva\n\nBank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.\n\nAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press files\n\nBank of CanadaCurrent overnight lending rate: 1.75 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: 2.25 per cent.The Bank of Canada is sticking to its view that more interest rates increases will be needed on top of five hikes over the past two years, but there seems to be a lot less urgency than there was a few months ago.Canada\u2019s\u00a0oil-producing regions were hit hard by last year\u2019s slide in crude prices, leading the BOC to sharply mark down the near-term outlook for the economy at its latest rate decision. It also softened its tone on future moves, saying they would only happen \u201cover time.\u201d\u00a0Still, the soft patch in growth is seen as a temporary one, and policymakers expect the economy to rebound later this year \u2013 putting them back on the hiking path.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cIncreasing global risks and slumping energy prices should keep the Bank of Canada on hold for all of 2019. The housing market and consumer spending may be moderating more than expected and wage growth has softened recently. This reduces the urgency for the central bank to stay ahead of inflationary pressures resulting from strong economic growth and a historically tight labour market last year.\u201d \u2014 Tim MahedyThe risks are skewed toward a delayed liftoffBloomberg economist Jamie Murray \n \nEuropean Central BankCurrent deposit\u00a0rate: -0.4 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: -0.25 per cent.The euro area reached a turning point for monetary stimulus when the ECB capped quantitative easing at the end of 2018. A slowing economy and sub-target inflation means the central bank will stay supportive. It intends to keep interest rates at record lows through this summer.Economists predict a hike late in the year, though investors don\u2019t expect one until 2020. Much will depend on how the 19-nation economy copes with risks from protectionism and volatility in emerging and financial markets.\u00a0Mario Draghi\u2019s presidential term expires in October, meaning he may leave without raising rates. Jockeying for his job has already started, with a decision by governments likely after European Parliament elections in May.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cInflation has plunged on oil costs, posing a risk to pay settlements, and the economy has slowed. These developments call for policy caution. Assuming growth stabilizes around trend and President Draghi passes the baton to a continuity candidate, we expect a hike to the deposit rate in December 2020.

Forecast for end of 2019: 1 per centMark Carney\u00a0is starting his final full year as Bank of England governor before he leaves in January 2020. He can expect the central bank\u2019s outlook to continue to be dominated by Brexit, especially after the U.K. formally leaves the EU on March 29.As the deadline nears and the chance of a chaotic exit rises, investors have bet there\u2019ll be no rate increases in the next 12 months, though economists foresee at least one squeezed in.\u00a0Carney has warned that a no-deal Brexit could drive up inflation that requires higher borrowing costs. If the government can get a deal signed in time, the market outlook could quickly be rewritten.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cBrexit uncertainty is at fever pitch. The Bank of England won\u2019t lift rates in that environment. We remain of the view that Brexit will be orderly. If it is, the central bank is likely to waste no time lifting rates \u2014 the first hike is likely in May and another should follow in November.\u201d \u2014 Dan Hanson\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan\n\nYOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBank of JapanCurrent policy-rate balance: -0.1 per cent. Forecast for end of 2019: -0.1 per cent.The BOJ faces a huge test in 2019 as inflation falls further below its two per cent target, exposing the limits of its massive monetary stimulus program. Some economists see a risk of the core consumer price index falling below zero as cheaper energy and mobile-phone charges undermine BOJ policies. January\u2019s flash crash in the currency market, which brought a sharp and unwelcome strengthening in the yen, underscores how much is beyond the central bank\u2019s control.While stimulus continues to weigh down profits at commercial banks and distorts the bond market, a majority of BOJ watchers expect Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to keep his current yield-curve settings in place at least through the end of 2019, with the short-term rate locked at minus 0.1 per cent and the 10-year bond yield target at around zero\u00a0per cent. Bond purchases are likely to be pared back further, while the BOJ\u2019s presence in the market for exchange-traded funds will depend on whether stocks need propping up. On balance the BOJ is expected to drift further from its peers as they chart a return to pre-crisis policies. The looming hike to the\u00a0sales tax may also complicate matters.What our economists say:\u00a0\u201cThe BOJ will need to maintain easing in 2019, with inflation weak and growth under pressure. The threat of renewed yen strength as U.S. Treasury yields retreat will also keep it on guard. Sustaining stimulus may grow more challenging. Financial imbalances are increasing \u2013\u00a0one reason to pull back. What\u2019s more, lower U.S. yields are putting downward pressure on JGB yields \u2013\u00a0and the further they fall, the less the need for BOJ purchases. A challenge ahead for Governor Kuroda will be to find a balance between two camps on the policy board \u2013\u00a0the reflationists, and those more concerned about the risks from the BOJ\u2019s policy.\u201d \u2014 Yuki MasujimaBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "Interest rates cast pall on Canadian home sales, with December losses capping worst year since 2012", "description": "Nationwide, sales totalled 458,442 for the year, a drop of 11 per cent which was the biggest since 2008, the Canadian Real Estate Association said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/home-sales-down-in-december-to-cap-weakest-annual-sales-since-2012-crea?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/for-sale-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 15, 2019 11:28 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s home sales skidded to the lowest level since 2012 last year after dropping for four straight months through December, as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market.Nationwide, sales totalled 458,442 for the year, a drop of 11 per cent which was the biggest since 2008, the Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday from Ottawa.

Like \u201cNew Barrick,\u201d which no longer has its top executives in Canada, Newmont Goldcorp\u2019s incoming chief executive officer and current chairwoman are expected to remain in the U.S. While some jobs will flow from Nevada to the miner\u2019s new regional base for North America in Vancouver, it\u2019s hard to imagine the influence of that city not waning as a result of the deal. \nNewmont to buy Goldcorp to create one of world\u2019s biggest gold producers\nBarrick Gold\u2019s new CEO dismisses debate over whether company will remain Canadian as \u2018hysteria\u2019\nBarrick\u2019s new CEO says shake up in the gold industry has only just begun\n\u201cAnytime you lose a head office, I think that\u2019s probably a negative but we know the Newmont senior team well, they\u2019re smart people, they\u2019ve built a good business, a big part of Goldcorp\u2019s business is their Canadian production,\u201d said Sean Boyd, chief executive officer of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., a Toronto-based gold miner.Typically, foreign takeovers of Canadian companies have bled strategic vision, high-paying jobs, management expertise and a host of ancillary services from finance and human resources to accounting. Like Falconbridge Ltd., Inco Ltd, and Alcan before, this latest deal in the mining sector will see Goldcorp\u2019s Canadian head office disappear.Canadian PresenceNewmont tried to mitigate that reality by saying the merger will ensure Canada\u2019s gold industry will participate in a \u201cworld-leading natural resources company,\u201d with a \u201csignificant\u201d Canadian presence on the board.The deal comes as the \u201chollowing out\u201d debate has been resurrected in Canada. Barrick\u2019s move to shift jobs away from Canada has intensified since the Randgold merger was announced; its current Toronto headcount is down to just 60 to 70 employees on one floor of a Bay Street office tower. The gold miner, founded by the late Peter Munk in Toronto in the 1980s, has just one Canadian director.Earlier this month, former Newmont vice chairman Pierre Lassonde was quoted in Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail saying Munk would be rolling over in his grave at the turn of events. At a Canadian Mining Hall of Fame dinner last week, he opened his remarks with a jab at the single Barrick table, suggesting anyone in the audience wanting to meet Barrick employees should do it fast as they could be gone before the end of dinner.Yet as Canada\u2019s once-mighty resource industries shrink \u2014 the energy sector is seeing its own share of pain \u2014 the economy has hardly been hurting. Growth was a Group-of-Seven-leading 3 pe rcent in 2017. And while economists see that slowing to 2.1 per cent in 2018 and 1.9 per cent in 2019, job growth remains solid with the unemployment rate at a four-decades low of 5.6 per cent in December.Tech BoomMuch of the country\u2019s growth has been driven by consumption \u2014 largely housing \u2014 which is now fading too but new industries are also rising \u2014 technology in particular.

Home sales in the Toronto region fell 16 per cent in 2018, while in Vancouver they plunged 32 per cent. Recent weakness in oil prices, meanwhile, could have spillover effects on the real estate markets in energy producing regions.The central bank revised down its expectations for the sector, which it now expects to shrink in 2019 after previously forecasting a small gain.Softness in interest-rate sensitive segments of the economy goes beyond housing. Spending on durable goods also dragged on third quarter growth. Auto sales fell on an annual basis for the first time since 2009, and analysts expect another retreat in 2019. The Bank of Canada revised consumption down, and now projects it to add just 1 percentage point to growth this year, which would be its weakest contribution since the 2009 recession.The Bank of Canada\u2019s \u201centire chop\u201d to projected 2019 growth \u2014 from 2.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent \u2014 is attributable to lower domestic demand, Bank of Montreal\u2019s Chief Economist Douglas Porter said Wednesday.\u2018Over-Tightened\u2019All this talk of more rate increases suggests policy makers may not fully appreciate the impact they\u2019re having on the economy, according to David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates. \u201cThe bank has over-tightened as it is,\u201d Rosenberg said Wednesday on BNN Bloomberg, adding he believes the hiking cycle has come to an end and it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if the next move was a cut.To be sure, the central bank is clearly aware of the issue, acknowledging Wednesday the economy may be more sensitive to higher rates than initially thought. It seems to be in no rush to hike, and it elevated developments in the nation\u2019s housing market to one of the three key factors that will determine the pace of policy normalization after data showed it \u201cslowed markedly.\u201d That\u2019s a shift from December, when Poloz described housing as \u201cstabilizing.\u201d It also stressed that any future move would be entirely data dependent.Still, the Bank of Canada estimates neutral rates of interest are somewhere between 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, which implies at least three more hikes from the current 1.75 per cent policy rate. But markets don\u2019t see Poloz even getting within 50 basis points of the midpoint of that range within the next five years, according to the overnight index swaps curve.There are too many unknowns about how the housing market will react to the cocktail of measures working to slow it down, said George Pearkes, chief macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group.\u201cWhen it\u2019s all combined with high prices at the same time, prudence is certainly warranted,\u201d Pearkes said.With assistance from Eric LamBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "RBC's CEO vows improvement on bank's disappointing mortgage performance", "description": "David McKay says the bank lost market share but has addressed 'deficiencies'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/rbcs-ceo-vows-improvement-to-disappointing-mortgage-performance", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mckay-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 11, 2019 11:04 AM EST", "content": "Royal Bank of Canada Chief Executive Officer David McKay is vowing to do better on Canadian mortgages after a couple years of disappointing performance.\u201cWe competed poorly in 2017 and \u201918 in the mortgage space,\u201d McKay, 55, said at the RBC Capital Markets Canadian Bank CEO Conference in Toronto on Tuesday. \u201cWe lost market share.\u201d \nMortgage growth will be flat or in low-single digits for \u2018foreseeable future\u2019: CIBC CEO\nThe year higher borrowing costs and stricter mortgage rules hit home\nWhen this man talks about housing markets, people listen \u2014 and now he\u2019s deeply concerned\nMargins in the domestic mortgage business \u201cwere challenged\u201d and the market was \u201csuper competitive\u201d last year, McKay said.

Markets are pricing in zero chance of an increase. The Bank of Canada will also release its quarterly economic forecasts Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Governor Stephen Poloz.What\u2019s certain is the Bank of Canada will need to revise down its projections for growth, at least for this year, thanks to weaker oil prices and transport bottlenecks that have prompted the Alberta government to implement temporary production cuts. In its October forecasts, the central bank estimated growth of 2.1 per cent in 2019 \u2014 which now looks on the high side.Economists see Canadian growth sliding closer to 1 per cent on an annualized basis for a few months, before bouncing back once Alberta\u2019s output cuts are lifted. After that, the pace of the expansion should return to near its recent trend of 2 per cent for the rest of the year.\u2018Solid Footing\u2019Recent data have been promising. Canada\u2019s economy continues to produce enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate at historic lows, and businesses remain upbeat about investment and hiring plans. Even oil prices have shown a bit of a comeback in recent days, giving a lift to the Canadian dollar to start the year.\u201cWe have entered a slow patch, but the economy is on solid footing,\u201d said Josh Nye, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, which is expecting the central bank to increase rates twice this year.Still, there\u2019s enough concern to curb the central bank\u2019s enthusiasm for higher rates and even in the best case Poloz is probably already near the end of his hiking cycle. For one, signs have begun to emerge that higher interest rates are slowing consumption and the housing market. There is also new evidence suggesting the economy had more slack in recent years than previously thought.Plus, with markets also pricing in a rate pause from the Federal Reserve, the Canadian central bank may be reluctant to press ahead with higher interest rates for fear of driving up the country\u2019s currency.But Poloz isn\u2019t sounding like someone who has given up on rate increases.

The government of Alberta, weighing the potential of a new refinery for the province, may be on its way to finding out.In 2018, surging crude production in the Canadian province ran into limited space on export pipelines, creating bottlenecks and sending the price of local oil to record lows relative to world benchmarks. Now Premier Rachel Notley\u2019s government wants to see if keeping more of the oil at home with a new refinery will make a difference.On Dec. 11, the government reported it was surveying private companies about building a new refinery. The goal: Free up space for crude on local pipelines by turning more of it into higher-value fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Analysts, though, say existing refineries in the province already produce more refined fuel than is needed. \nCalgary housing market takes a hit as oilpatch job losses return\n\u2018A made-in-Canada crisis\u2019: How political stumbles, savvy activists brought the oilpatch to its knees\n\u2018A handout without addressing the root cause\u2019: Oil industry recoils at Ottawa\u2019s $1.6 billion loan offering\n\u201cIts not a lot different than the issue they have with crude,\u201d Jason Parent, vice president of consulting at Kent Group Ltd, a downstream consultancy based in London, Ontario. \u201cYou still have to ship that product to market.\u201dThe province will accept submissions for refinery proposals until Feb. 8 and will consider greenfield projects and expansions at existing sites. At this point, the government is only seeking a sense of the projects companies may be considering and isn\u2019t yet ready to say how it would support those plans.Heavy Western Canadian Select, the type of crude produced in Alberta, fell to aUS $50 a barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark. The situation became so acute that Alberta\u2019s government announced a mandatory, province-wide 8.7 per cent production cut to keep prices from falling further.\n\nAn oil refinery in Edmonton.\n\nIan Kucerak/Postmedia News\n\nNew oil export pipeline projects \u2014 including TransCanada Corp.\u2019s Keystone XL, and the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to the Vancouver area \u2014 have faced environmental opposition and court-imposed delays. Even Enbridge Inc.\u2019s Line 3 expansion, approved and scheduled to start operation in the second half of this year, is facing legal challenges from opponents.While building more refining capacity in the province would reduce the glut of crude oil, the province\u2019s five existing refineries already produce more refined fuels \u2014 including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel \u2014 than is needed. And, as with crude oil, pipeline links for refined products to markets outside Alberta are limited.The 300,000 barrel-a-day Trans Mountain line transported 42,000 barrels a day of fuels to the Vancouver area for use by drivers in British Columbia. Enbridge\u2019s Line 1 moves gasoline and diesel from Edmonton, Alberta, to third parties in Gretna, Manitoba, but none to the U.S.Alberta is already home to Canada\u2019s newest refinery. The North West Redwater Partnership\u2019s Sturgeon plant, which opened in 2018, produces 40,000 barrels a day of diesel as well as vacuum gasoil and propane and butane. But that project only came to fruition with government loans and a commitment by Alberta to process 37,500 barrels per day of royalty bitumen at the plant for a toll that helps cover construction costs, which have more than doubled since the project was first proposed to $9.7 billion as of last year.More Alberta-based refining was a no-brainer twenty or thirty years ago. The economics are more challenging nowGil McGowan, president of Alberta Federation of Labor \n \nBuilding refineries in Alberta isn\u2019t cheap. A single 100,000 barrel a day plant would cost between US$6.9 and US$8.6 billion versus US$2.9 to US$3.6 billion in south China, IHS Markit said in a 2017 report.At the same time, a new refinery would compete in a North American market where fuel demand is flat or declining, and where refineries built decades ago are already supplying local markets with the fuel they need, according to Kevin Birn, IHS Markit\u2019s director of North American crude oil markets.\u201cMore Alberta-based refining was a no-brainer twenty or thirty years ago,\u201d said Gil McGowan, president of Alberta Federation of Labor and a supporter of building more refining capacity in Alberta. \u201cThe economics are more challenging now.\u201d A new refinery would have to focus on exports, probably to Asia, he said.Refineries would free up some space on pipelines by displacing imported condensate that\u2019s diluted with bitumen to make the sticky oil flow, Birn said in a telephone interview. But imported condensate is already increasingly being displaced as local condensate production rises in the tight oil and gas formations of Western Canada.Building refineries in Alberta is \u201cnot a solution to the current takeaway situation,\u201d Birn said in a telephone interview. \u201cBy the time you get this facility on, you are looking four or five years down the line.

Lower house prices and higher mortgage rates will not only dent consumer confidence, but also disposable incomes, S&P Global Ratings said in a report last month. A simultaneous decline in house prices globally could lead to \u201cfinancial and macroeconomic instability,\u201d the IMF said in study released in April.While each city in the region has its own distinct characteristics, there are a few common denominators: rising borrowing costs, increased government regulation and volatile stock markets. There\u2019s also dwindling demand from a force so powerful it pushed prices to a record in many places \u2014 Chinese buyers. \nThe year higher borrowing costs and stricter mortgage rules hit home\nVancouver home sales fall to lowest yearly total in 18 years, detached home prices drop\nWhen this man talks about housing markets, people listen \u2014 and now he\u2019s deeply concerned\n\u201cAs China\u2019s economy is affected by the trade war, capital outflows have become more difficult, thus weakening demand in markets including Sydney and Hong Kong,\u201d said Patrick Wong, a real estate analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Hong KongAfter an almost 15-year bull run that made Hong Kong notorious for having the world\u2019s least affordable property market, home prices have taken a battering.Values in the city have fallen for 13 weeks straight since August, the longest losing streak since 2008, figures from Centaline Property Agency Ltd. show. Concerns about higher borrowing costs and a looming vacancy tax have contributed to the slide.\n\nResidential buildings stand illuminated in Hong Kong, China.\n\nPaul Yeung/Bloomberg\n\nThe strike rate of mainland Chinese developers successfully bidding for residential sites is also waning, tumbling to 27 per cent in 2018 from 70 per cent in 2017, JLL\u2019s Residential Sales Market Monitor released Thursday showed. Of the 11 residential sites tendered by authorities last year, only three were won by Chinese companies.\u201cThe change in attitude can be explained by a slowing mainland economy,\u201d said Henry Mok, JLL\u2019s senior director of capital markets. \u201cThrow in a simmering trade war between China and the U.S., the government has taken actions to restrict capital outflows, which in turn has increased difficulties for developers to invest overseas.\u201dSingaporeHome prices on the island, which regularly ranks among the world\u2019s most expensive places to live, posted their first drop in six quarters in the three months ended December. Luxury was hit the hardest, with values in prime areas sinking 1.5 per cent.Government policies are mainly to blame. Cooling measures implemented unexpectedly in July included higher stamp duties and tougher loan-to-value rules. Extra constraints since then have included curbs on the number of \u201cshoe-box\u201d apartments and anti-money laundering rules that imposed an additional administrative burden on developers.It\u2019s all worked to put the brakes on a home-price recovery that only lasted for five quarters, the shortest since data became available.\u201cLanded home prices, being bigger ticket items, have taken a greater beating as demand softened,\u201d said Ong Teck Hui, a senior director of research and consultancy at JLL. (In Singapore, most people live in high-rise apartments, called housing development board flats. Landed homes by contrast occupy their own ground space.)SydneySydney-siders have begun to wonder \u2014 what sort of economic fallout will there be from the wealth destruction that comes with the worst slump in home values since the late 1980s?Average home values in the harbour city have fallen 11.1 per cent since their 2017 peak, according to CoreLogic Inc. data released Wednesday \u2014 surpassing the 9.6 per cent top-to-bottom decline when Australia was on the cusp of entering its last recession.While prices are still about 60 per cent higher than they were in 2012, meaning few existing homeowners are actually underwater, it\u2019s economist forecasts of a further 10 per cent fall that\u2019s making nervous investors think twice about extraneous spending.The central bank is also worried that a prolonged downturn will drag on consumption and with the main opposition Labor party pledging to curb tax perks for property investors if it wins an election expected in May, confidence is likely to be hit further.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday urged the nation\u2019s banks not to tighten credit any more as the deepening downturn threatens to weigh on the economy.Shanghai, BeijingA crackdown on overheating prices has hampered sales and left values in the nation\u2019s biggest cities around 5 per cent below their peak.

That would be the biggest increase since 2016, when stocks gained 18 per cent.Ten stocks for 2019: What the pros are picking to outperform this yearIt could be worse: An optimist\u2019s guide to investing in 2019Outlook 2019: Here\u2019s where the experts think the TSX will end up one year from now\u201cOur expectation is that 2019 is going to be a better year than 2018 based on the fact that pessimism right now is at extreme levels,\u201d Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital Corp., said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen everybody\u2019s on the same trade, when everybody\u2019s negative, we think this is a good opportunity to go in the other direction.\u201dBangsund expects the S&P/TSX to end 2019 at 16,800 amid strong earnings, and recommends investors overweight beaten-down energy stocks and financials. This time last year, she predicted the market would finish 2018 at 16,900 and later raised that target to 17,300.Instead, the Canadian benchmark fell 12 per cent in 2018 to 14,323, with most of that drop coming in the final quarter of the year amid a decline in global stocks. Concerns about a global trade war, rising interest rates, a housing slowdown and plunging oil prices all weighed on the Canadian market.Crude RealityEnergy stocks were the worst performers, posting a decline of 21 per cent, followed by consumer discretionary, down 18 per cent. Even pot stocks, which were a bastion of optimism for Canadian investors as the country legalized recreational marijuana, ended the year in negative territory.It\u2019s been a frustrating experience for investors and strategists alike. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, had a strong track record of calling the market before 2018. His forecast for the S&P/TSX in 2017 was only 200 points below the final closing number while his 2016 forecast came within 12 points of the close. His estimate of 17,600 for 2018 was off by a wide margin, however. Belski sees 2019 ending at 18,000, 26 per cent above current levels.Bear Facts\u201cFundamentals can, will, and should be rewarded at some point,\u201d he wrote in a 2019 market outlook published in November. \u201cIn our view, the best time to be contrarian is when the analysis is telling you something exceedingly different from what sentiment and rhetoric is exhibiting.\u201d He added that \u201cCanada is rich with solid companies\u201d and investors should take a bottom-up approach to stock picking, paying particular attention to energy and financials.Not everyone is optimistic there will be a big rebound. Sadiq Adatia, who manages about $23 billion (US$17 billion) as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, sees the S&P/TSX closing out the year at 15,000, just 4.7 per cent above current levels. Adatia was the most bearish forecaster last year as well, initially predicting the benchmark would end the year at 15,200 and later raising that to a range of 16,000 to 16,250.\u201cWhat has me worried is that consumers are losing steam\u201d amid rising interest rates, Adatia said in a phone interview, adding that he expects the Bank of Canada will hike rates once in 2019 but would prefer if it didn\u2019t hike at all.\u201cRates will impact how consumers spend going forward, how they deal with their debt levels and what happens in the housing market as well,\u201d he said. However, Canada may not fare as badly as some of its global counterparts.\u201cWe think if you hold a portion of your portfolio in Canada, it\u2019s because of risk management,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get a major continuation of the selloff and we get into bear market territory, Canada might actually hold up relatively well because it hasn\u2019t participated fully on the upside of this bull market.\u201dHere are the strategists\u2019 calls for 2019, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,000Edward Jones: 15,600Russell Investments: 16,000Scotia Capital: 16,500Fiera Capital: 16,800Manulife: 17,250BMO Capital Markets: 18,000Laurentian Bank: 18,000Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Andrew Mayeda and Mike Dorning", "title": "Trump renews attacks on Federal Reserve, calls it the U.S. economy's 'only problem'", "description": "U.S. stocks fell back toward their session lows after Trump's outburst, with the S&P 500 Index on track to close at a 19-month low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-blasts-federal-reserve-as-u-s-economys-only-problem", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/fed.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 24, 2018 12:30 PM EST", "content": "President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on the Federal Reserve, commenting publicly on the central bank for the first time following last week\u2019s interest-rate hike and reports he has discussed firing Chairman Jerome Powell.\u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed.

He held a conference call Monday with regulators that oversee banks and markets to try, without success, to restore calm.\u201cThe market is lacking full confidence in the Fed right now, but part of it is Trump\u2019s undermining of it,\u201d said Stephen Myrow, managing partner at Beacon Policy Advisors LLC in Washington and former Treasury official under President George W. Bush.Economy\u2019s StateWhile Fed rate hikes have contributed to equity declines and a softer housing market, the American economy is being buffeted by a few factors owing to the Trump administration and Congress.Trump\u2019s trade war with China is creating uncertainty for businesses. U.S. government debt is approaching US$22 trillion. A federal shutdown this week is raising concerns about Washington\u2019s ability to find bipartisan solutions to pressing problems.Recent data show economic growth is holding up fairly well but may moderate heading into next year. The labour market is solid and unemployment at 3.7 per cent is the lowest since 1969. One measure of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in December as views on economic conditions improved, helping bolster the outlook for American spending.Gross domestic product is seen expanding 2.9 per cent this year, buoyed by tax cuts and higher federal spending signed by Trump, but the pace is expected to slow in 2019 as fiscal stimulus fades. The White House argues lower corporate taxes will boost productivity and help the economy grow faster without causing inflation, and therefore the Fed doesn\u2019t need to tighten policy.The turmoil engulfing Washington \u2014 and the financial market rout that\u2019s happening in response \u2014 widened after Bloomberg News, late Friday, reported Trump\u2019s discussion about firing Powell. Mnuchin said in a pair of tweets Saturday evening that he\u2019d spoken with the president about the matter, and he quoted Trump saying he didn\u2019t believe he had the authority to remove the central bank chief.Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s pick for the next White House chief of staff, said Sunday he\u2019d spoken to Mnuchin and that Trump \u201cnow realizes he does not have the ability\u201d to fire a Fed chairman.Trump has yet to publicly affirm that belief himself.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "The verdict is in: Canada's 2015 downturn amid shock oil collapse wasn't a recession", "description": "'It was an extremely close vote,' but C.D.

Vehicle sales, among the sectors most sensitive to rising rates, fell the most since 2009, while growth in residential mortgages decelerated to the slowest pace since 1982, worrying signs for an economy so reliant on consumption.The tide has turned, and the water's starting to rise.

The insolvency trustee and debt relief agency received 1,000 new inquiries, compared with 650 in November 2017, and initiated 384 new filings, surpassing the previous high of 350 in November 2009. Through the first 10 days of December, Michalos said the firm\u2019s numbers are up 57 per cent from a year earlier.Payday LoansLower gasoline prices aren\u2019t fully offsetting higher mortgage costs, and \u201cthere is very little room in many Canadians\u2019 budgets to absorb these increased costs,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s also seeing more clients with so-called installment loans, basically large, high-interest payday loans that can be paid off over a longer period.Mantin, whose Vancouver-based firm recorded it\u2019s biggest year-over-year increase in filings in November since he joined eight years ago, also cited an increase in large payday loans among his clients.

Gross domestic product in the city of 2.8 million people has been running at about 3.4 per cent for the past three years, above its population growth of 1.6 per cent, according to a city report.Jared Menkes, executive vice president of high-rise residential at Menkes Developments was unwavering for the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of red tape that\u2019s slowing down bringing more product to market,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cI promise you, pricing is going up.\u201dBelow are additional insights on what to expect in 2019:Jared Menkes on condo sales outlook in 2019:\u201cI think 2019, you\u2019re going be putting in more work just like for 2018 \u2014 it\u2019s not like it was 2016 or 2017, where you just opened the door and there\u2019s a line up around the block. It\u2019s rolling up your sleeves, telling the story, explaining the value proposition, the reasons to buying into this location.\u201dShamez Virani on shift to suburbs:\u201cThe big part of the solution is the 905. Municipalities like Vaughn, Mississauga, Markham and Richmond Hill are all municipalities that have realized that because of price appreciation, all of a sudden, there is development potential on a lot of their land. They\u2019re realizing that the City of Toronto is slowly closing the taps to new development and they\u2019re going to be the beneficiaries of it, so there\u2019s been this really meaningful shift in the last two years for developers to really go into the 905.\u201dJim Ritchie on condo price growth opportunities:\u201cThere are opportunities in 2019 where there could be reasonably good price increases depending on the product and where it is. There are some parts in our city that have a lot more competition and are building very similar product lines, maybe in that particular circumstance, we\u2019re not going to see as much inflation, but you really have to break it out and look at it.\u201dJane Renwick on affordable housing:\u201cBefore, development didn\u2019t happen east of Yonge because of Regent Park and Moss Park and where we had these areas where we had a concentration of social housing as opposed to it being integrated among market housing.

Companies could focus on housing that uses pre-treated timber or modular construction, speedier, cheaper home-building alternatives.\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting priced out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy students at the Rotman School of Management in the University of Toronto, who are going to be some of the most successful students in Canadian business, are now saying it\u2019s doubtful they could ever afford a single-family home.\u201dMeanwhile, Ross is running out of options as she scrambles to secure future housing. She\u2019s anxiously awaiting to hear back from the lottery which is offering up a one-bedroom unit for $962 including utilities in the redeveloped Regent Park. The former crack haven is now a mixed-used neighbourhood that includes affordable rentals and market-priced condos alongside sports fields, an aquatic centre, community meeting spaces and cafes.The city will likely need dozens of such neighbourhoods to handle the influx in newcomers.At one point, Ross even called a shelter to see what her options would be if she was kicked out of her apartment. \u201cThey said you have to call weeks in advance.

Since then, they\u2019ve been little changed even as market transactions have fallen sharply.To be sure, risks remain. Young home buyers have never faced anything other than historically low mortgage rates and many will have to refinance over the next few years, while policy makers remain concerned about a cluster of highly indebted borrowers.Growing signs of a sustainable housing market allow the Bank of Canada to keep moving ahead with modest interest-rate increases in an economy that\u2019s otherwise at full capacity. Government officials can also hold back on new interventions that could spook households.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re settling into this environment in Canada where price growth is going to be flat in real terms,\u201d something that hasn\u2019t happened outside of a recession since the 1990s, Bank of Montreal Senior Economist Robert Kavcic said by phone from Toronto.Prices and sales showed modest gains or losses for October in reports Thursday from the Canadian Real Estate Association and from the Teranet land registry. That\u2019s a switch from most of the last year where they swung in response to tougher mortgage qualification rules and the first interest-rate hiking cycle from the central bank in almost a decade.\u2018Medicine Is Working\u2019Home sales held close to their 10-year average after falling for a second month in October, the realtor group said. Benchmark prices rose 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, and gains in Vancouver and Toronto were close to the national average.Canada would stand out if it comes through its housing boom without a crash like those seen in the U.S., the U.K. or Spain. \u201cOverall, yes the medicine is working,\u201d Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview.\u201cWe are reaching some sort of landing, how soft it will be I don\u2019t know, but we aren\u2019t in a free-fall by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Tal said.Even with the latest figures showing stability, it could take years to unwind the imbalances that have built up. The rise of the million-dollar home in some of Canada\u2019s biggest cities has also created affordability challenges for buyers as builders struggle to offer new supply.\u201cIts absolutely fair to say the Canadian housing market is off the boil,\u201d Lascelles said, adding a note of caution: \u201cThere is no pre-ordained conclusion here.\u201dWith assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Andrew Blackman and Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett to expand his real estate empire to Milan, Dubai", "description": "Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices wants to be in every major metropolitan market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/warren-buffett-to-expand-his-real-estate-empire-to-milan-dubai", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/warren-buffett1.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 13, 2018 2:50 PM EST", "content": "One of Warren Buffett\u2019s real estate brokerages waited 18 years to sign its first overseas franchise deal.
