Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That\u2019s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year \u2014 a level Sanderson describes as \u201cvery tight.\u201d\u201cMany retailers are in trouble,\u201d Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. \u201cI think when we get to the other side of this, there\u2019s a real reckoning to be had.\u201dI think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadRoelof van Dijk \n \nMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maria Jose Valero", "title": "Shopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge", "description": "One analyst says near-record valuation 'somewhat surprising' given uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-too-hot-to-handle-for-some-analysts-after-latest-surge?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc.\u2019s $38-billion (US$27 billion) stock-market gain since the beginning of the year has some analysts calling a time out.The e-commerce services provider has surged 61 per cent to a market value of $97 billion. That briefly catapulted it ahead of Toronto-Dominion Bank on Monday to become the second-most valuable company on Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index, though it fell back to No. 3 on Tuesday as global markets slumped.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to make money at the valuation Shopify is trading at,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Samad Samana, one of the most bearish analysts on the stock. Risk-reward is not attractive and it\u2019s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York. \nShopify pushes past TD to become Canada\u2019s second-biggest stock\nShopify expands capital lending program to help Canadian merchants weather COVID-19\nShopify suspends guidance, indicates it banned thousands of users for COVID-19 profiteering\nBrian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is \u201csomewhat surprising\u201d given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company\u2019s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify\u2019s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not \u201cnecessarily equate to sales volume.\u201dA likely recession, \u201cif we\u2019re not in one already,\u201d will inevitably see a downturn in sales as \u201cno one is immune\u201d to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify\u2019s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify\u2019s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada\u2019s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Jeremy Herron", "title": "Stocks surge as investors snatch some hope from earnings and oil rallies on Iran tensions", "description": "Companies, however, warned of more pain in the coming months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-to-decline-oil-collapse-deepens-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stocks-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 5:45 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks halted a two-day slide as investors digested the latest round of corporate earnings.

He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Cannabis bankruptcies start to roll in as pandemic halts financing", "description": "The weakest companies are succumbing and even relatively healthy firms are showing signs of strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/bankruptcies-begin-as-pandemic-halts-financing-cannabis-weekly", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canntrust.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 6, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The cannabis bankruptcy filings are starting to roll in.Already plagued by a tough regulatory environment, disappointing sales and capital markets that had closed to all but the strongest companies, the industry is now facing a pandemic-related collapse in stock markets and ever-shrinking financing options. Pot companies completed two capital raises worth just US$5.6 million the week ended March 27, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors. That\u2019s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn\u2019t able to recover from. \nOntario drops cannabis from list of essential businesses allowed to operate during lockdown\nCannabis company CannTrust granted creditor protection\nGlobal stock meltdown is a disaster for cannabis industry already on the brink\n\u201cThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cmaking it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.\u201dThere are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company\u2019s weak revenue in the quarter \u2014 just US$7.3 million \u2014 prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges. Revised debt covenants require it to raise $40 million in equity by April 30, a \u201cstartling sum\u201d that \u201ccould mean severe downward pressure\u201d on the stock, according to CIBC analyst John Zamparo. If it can\u2019t secure that financing, that \u201cwould put its going concern status at risk,\u201d said BMO\u2019s Tamy Chen.Although cannabis sales jumped as self-isolation orders took effect last month, providing a rare respite for the struggling industry, there are already signs the initial spike is starting to wane.After a notable increase in mid-March, \u201csales velocity meaningfully decelerated\u201d on the Ontario Cannabis Store website last weekend, \u201csuggesting that this recent surge may be transitory unless COVID-19 quarantine measures are meaningfully extended,\u201d Chen said in a note. \u201cWe believe the COVID-19 fallout presents incremental downside for industry sales over the balance of this year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Brandall Jensen and Vildana Hajric", "title": "North American stocks rebound on news of five-minute coronavirus test and vaccine candidate", "description": "Investors are beginning the week hearing that the biggest economy will stay crippled for longer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/oil-plunges-to-2002-lows-shares-sink-again?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/wall-stree.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:21 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rallied as investors saw glimmers of optimism in efforts to deliver rapid testing for the new coronavirus.

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic. Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000.

That announcement may have contributed to the stock market\u2019s late-day swoon. \nHere\u2019s what the investing pros are buying amid the coronavirus volatility\nRetail investors say they\u2019re losing thousands as brokerages struggle with record traffic due to coronavirus panic\nEven unlimited quantitative easing from the Fed can\u2019t buoy markets\n\u201cWhen some of the short-term traders saw that, they decided to take some chips off the table in front of the weekend,\u201d said Matt Maley, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. \u201cThey probably decided it was a good idea to pare back some of their long positions in front of the weekend.\u201dInvestors had piled back into the battered U.S. equity market this week on speculation that the massive relief bill would offset some of the pandemic\u2019s impact on businesses and households. A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic. Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India on Friday became the latest central bank to step up emergency action to cushion the economic impact.\u201cIt is by no means a given that volatility has ceased to be a feature of global equity markets,\u201d said Paul Markham, global equities portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. \u201cMarkets will oscillate between the reassurance that governments and central banks will be standing by to support them and the uncertainty of both the duration and depth of what will undoubtedly be a significant economic impact.\u201dThese are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index decreased 3.4% as of 4 p.m. New York time.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.\u201d\u201cI am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office.

It\u2019s cozy to say the least.\u201dLiquid ETFsDavid Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.:\u201cWhen I am talking to the traders, I\u2019m focused on ETFs, it\u2019s because that\u2019s where the volume is and that\u2019s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it\u2019s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that\u2019s what I have been recommending people invest.\u201d He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs.He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said.

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices.

Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here\u2019s a synopsis of the discussion.Market Structure TestFinancial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that\u2019s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. \u201cHistorically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,\u201d she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. \u201cLiquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dEither way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.\u201cThey are not traditional market makers any longer,\u201d said McCreadie. \u201cI think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.\u201dOil And TroubleThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country\u2019s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.\u201cIf you look at the impact on the oil market, it\u2019s very, very negative for Western Canada,\u201d Vanderhooft said. \u201cAs bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.\u201dSmaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.\u201cThis time around a lot of these smaller players aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.\u201dThe increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks\u2019 thinking more now, said Marks. \u201cYou already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.\u201dVanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a \u201cmore negative position\u201d on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.Carry OnAll three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.\u201c2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn\u2019t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,\u201d McCreadie said, adding there\u2019s unlikely to be \u201csystem failure\u201d now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear marketKevin McCreadie \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,\u201d he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. \u201cI think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.\u201dMarks said BMO hasn\u2019t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. \u201cIn conversations with clients, we haven\u2019t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that \u2018Get me out of the market\u2019 across the board.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe will get through this event,\u201d McCreadie said. \u201cWe always do.\u201dNext Steps\u201cYou talk about fully balanced portfolios, that\u2019s where clients need to be,\u201d said Vanderhooft. \u201cAt times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that\u2019s the case.\u201dMcCreadie\u2019s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth\u2019s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November. While stocks have become cheaper, the lack of visibility makes it \u201chard to have conviction to step in,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Greifeld and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Stocks roar back as governments pledge to step up virus response", "description": "The S&P 500\u2019s gain Friday was its biggest since 2008, even as the gauge lost 11 per cent this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-set-to-tumble-after-wall-street-rout-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-9.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 12, 2020 6:00 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks jumped as President Donald Trump joined other world leaders in seeking to reassure investors that they\u2019ll step up efforts to protect the economy from the coronavirus fallout.The S&P 500 rose more than 9 per cent, providing some respite after stocks\u2019 worst day since 1987, as Trump declared a national emergency to help combat the virus, moved to prop up energy prices and said the private sector will help with efforts to expand testing.

Cases are continuing to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses are weighing on sentiment.

Western Canada Select, the benchmark grade produced by Canada\u2019s oil sands, was down about 19 per cent to US$22.71 a barrel on Monday, in line with the 20 per cent drop for West Texas Intermediate.Canadian producers, particularly those focused in the higher-cost oilsands, have spent years trying to make their operations more efficient. They\u2019ve also curtailed capital spending and worked to repair their balance sheets. Now those efforts will be put to the test. \nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nGlobal stampede out of stocks and oil collapse trample loonie, Canadian energy shares\nOil crash sends a new shock through world already crippled by coronavirus\n\u201cAt these commodity prices, nobody is making money and everybody is going to be free cash flow negative,\u201d said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dThe oil decline hammered Canadian energy stocks. The 30-company S&P/TSX energy index plunged as much as 22 per cent Monday, its biggest intraday decline in Bloomberg data stretching back to 1988. Among the biggest decliners were Cenovus Energy Inc., which dropped as much as 49 per cent, and MEG Energy Corp., which tumbled as much as 47 per cent.To be sure, the long period of retrenchment leaves some Calgary-based producers better prepared for the current crisis than they were for the 2014 crash, which saw U.S. crude prices plummet from above US$100 a barrel in July 2014 to about US$26 less than two years later.For example, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada\u2019s largest integrated oil company, last month reported a cash operating cost of $28.55 per barrel in its oilsands operations last quarter, down 17 per cent from five years ago. The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Below Break EvenCanadian energy companies \u201care better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. \u201cWhile in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels \u2014 WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time \u2014 some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.\u201cThe industry simply doesn\u2019t work at these prices,\u201d Ollenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands.

Brent crude tumbled by almost a third to US$31 a barrel on Monday, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. told clients it could quickly dip into the US$20s.Such an extraordinary slump, if sustained, would savage national budgets from Venezuela to Iran, threaten the heartland of America\u2019s shale revolution and upend politics around the world. For central bankers, the prospect of destabilizing prices are an added complication as they try to model the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy. And a long period of cheap oil prices could even hurt the fight against climate change by slowing the transition to renewable energy. \nOil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out\nFor Alberta\u2019s embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nCanadian energy shares, loonie getting crushed in global stampede out of stocks\n\u201cSomething like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy,\u201d said Rohitesh Dhawan, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group in London.There are winners from rock-bottom oil prices \u2014 among them China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer, whose recovery from the virus will be key for the global economy.Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy \n \nBut this time is different. The U.S. \u2014 once a winner from low oil \u2014 is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks \u2014 on the way up \u2014 used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.\u201cLower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. \u201cBut now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.\u201dRussian StrategyThe crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there\u2019s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday\u2019s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry \u2014 when prices went as low as US$26 \u2014 contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year\u2019s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown \n \nRussia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it\u2019s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency \u2014 unlike Saudi Arabia \u2014 and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.\u201cRussia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic \u2014 and even political \u2014 self-harm didn\u2019t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Aramco RoutSaudi Aramco \u2014 the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince\u2019s credibility on the line \u2014 saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.\u201cOil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,\u201d said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.\n\nOil tanks at Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMaxim Shemetov/Reuters files\n\nMore immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred \u2014 as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc \u2014 though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it\u2019s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.\u201cSharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors\u2019 energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,\u201d said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIn the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.\u201dThe crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry\u2019s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.Going GreenA slowdown in green plans isn\u2019t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use \u2014 increasing emissions \u2014 and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe \u2014 which is leading the charge on climate change policies \u2014 the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn\u2019t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.\u201cThe Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it\u2019s not clear this will work,\u201d said the LSE\u2019s Hertog, author of \u2018Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia\u2019.\u201cIn the end, this will be Putin\u2019s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Rate cut necessary to shore up confidence amid coronavirus shock, Bank of Canada's Poloz says", "description": "Virus impact combined with domestic headwinds could lead to slower growth through first two quarters, and possibly even further, Poloz said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/poloz-says-canada-rate-cut-needed-to-shore-up-confidence?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stephen-poloz-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 5, 2020 1:18 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz justified his decision to slash interest rates on Wednesday as a confidence-boosting measure that can help \u201cbridge\u201d the fallout from the coronavirus.The impact of the shock combined with domestic headwinds could lead to slower growth through the first two quarters of this year, and possibly even further if the downturn undermines confidence, Poloz said in a speech on Thursday, a day after the central bank cut its policy rate by half a percentage point.\u201cThere is a real risk that business and consumer confidence will erode further, creating a more persistent slowdown, especially given recent declines in stock markets,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks of the speech. \nCoronavirus testing post-crisis maxim that rate cuts alone can buoy markets\nThe case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy\nBank of Canada cuts rate by half point, stands ready to cut more in face of coronavirus threat\nWednesday\u2019s cut marked a reversal for Poloz, who had been one of the few central bankers over the past year to resist lowering borrowing costs \u2014 in part because of concern cuts would fuel the nation\u2019s high household debt levels.

Poloz Thursday put much of the emphasis on a major unknown: the impact the crisis could have on broader confidence levels.\u201cIt is possible that the global economy will snap back quickly after the health professionals have managed the situation and conditions have returned to normal,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cHowever, the outbreak and its effects could be more persistent. Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently.\u201dPoloz\u2019s speech is what the central bank calls its Economic Progress Report, in which it aims to provide insight into deliberations following the rate decisions that aren\u2019t accompanied by new forecasts.

Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent. \nThe case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy\nCanadian companies ramp up coronavirus precautions with travel restrictions, work-at-home options\nFalling victim to market fear may do more damage to your portfolio than the coronavirus itself\nBank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a \u201csignificant interruption\u201d to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past \u2014 a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus \u2014 have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nThat is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201d1990s ReplayPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.Missing SignalsFor Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

While it probably doesn\u2019t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it\u2019s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week \u2014 and that\u2019s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox\u2019s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It\u2019s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox\u2019s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it\u2019s a pretty dry business. \nCoronavirus crash wipes $6 trillion off world stocks; TSX drops most in 5 years\nMarket panics like this one can be fertile ground for \u2018bottom-up\u2019 investors\nChance of Canadian supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus high: RBC\nBut the Centers for\u00a0Disease Control and Prevention is warning that\u00a0the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China\u2019s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now\u00a0threaten\u00a0the U.S. If that\u2019s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. \u201cSo far we\u2019re not seeing an uptick,\u201d Clorox CEO Benno Dorer\u00a0said during the company\u2019s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees\u00a0Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox\u2019s stock is already quite expensive, and it\u2019s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their \u201csell\u201d ratings on the stock after Clorox\u2019s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company\u2019s other product lines \u2014 bags and charcoal \u2014continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn\u2019t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it\u2019s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division \u201cgrilling\u201d to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn\u2019t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox\u2019s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it\u2019s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt\u2019s Bees lip care.)With this week\u2019s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak.\u00a0Clorox may play\u00a0its own\u00a0crucial role in combating the disease,\u00a0but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "TSX ready for opening bell after early close yesterday over technical issue", "description": "Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stock-bourse-says-ready-for-friday-open-after-early-close", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 28, 2020 7:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s main stock exchanges said all systems are ready for the start of business on Friday after halting trading for hours due to a technical issue.The Toronto Stock Exchange said interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX Group Ltd.\u2019s trading engine. The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.Exchanges operated by TMX stopped trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time.

At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives. The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group\u2019s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.\u201cI don\u2019t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,\u201d said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. \u201cVolume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,\u201d Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues \u201cbut it\u2019s not impossible to trade,\u201d she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. \u201cRest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,\u201d he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission.

At his own Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which underperformed the stock market last year by the widest margin in a decade, an increase in repurchases might not be cause for celebration.Buffett has found little success deploying Berkshire\u2019s growing pile of cash. Its last big takeover, a US$37.2 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp., was more than three years ago. This year, the conglomerate was outbid for a tech company. Berkshire\u2019s struggle to find well-priced takeovers led it to open another path for putting money to work: The company loosened its buyback policy almost two years ago, but has repurchased only US$4.1 billion of its shares since then.\u201cWe\u2019re gradually getting more pessimistic about using our money,\u201d Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we bought anything.\u201d \nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire dips into ETF market with two bets for a pension plan\nThe gospel according to Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger: lower your expectations\nWarren Buffett finally has dinner with Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur who paid $4.57-million for the opportunity\nBuybacks haven\u2019t made much of a dent in Berkshire\u2019s record US$128-billion mountain of money either, weighing on its stock price because, as Buffett himself says, the funds earn \u201conly a pittance.\u201d Berkshire investors will be scouring Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, set for release Saturday, for clues about his strategy after a year of missed deals and shares that rose at a slower pace than the S&P 500 Index \u2014 their worst underperformance since 2009.We're gradually getting more pessimistic about using our moneyCharlie Munger \n \n\u201cThey just aren\u2019t buying back a lot of stock, they aren\u2019t putting a lot of money to work in public securities, they\u2019re not buying portfolio companies outright,\u201d Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview. \u201cThe cash balance continues to grow.\u201dNo ElephantsWhile 2019 wasn\u2019t the year for an \u201celephant-sized acquisition,\u201d Buffett was hunting. Berkshire reportedly passed on Tiffany & Co. but did make an offer for Tech Data Corp., ultimately losing out to private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc.The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also spent the last few months of the year plowing money into stocks new to its portfolio, taking stakes in Kroger Co. and Biogen Inc. Even that did little to chip away at Berkshire\u2019s cash hoard, and it was still a net seller of stocks in the fourth quarter.Buffett\u2019s letter will be released alongside Berkshire\u2019s annual report, which will include quarterly results for his sprawling company. Operating earnings probably rose in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, according to Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Berkshire\u2019s net-income figure now factors in swings in the US$220-billion stock portfolio, volatility that Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore.As for acquisitions, Buffett for years has stressed patience, with prices for good businesses becoming \u201csky-high.\u201d Last year, the S&P 500 Index notched its biggest gain since 2013. Waiting for markets to turn might be the wisest course for Buffett, according to Shields.\u2018Do Nothing\u2019\u201cThe right thing to do is to do nothing if the potential acquisitions are overpriced,\u201d Shields said in an interview.As to whether the challenging environment for acquisitions could mean more Berkshire share buybacks in the future, Munger provided no guidance in last week\u2019s interview, following the annual meeting of his Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles.\u201cWho can tell?\u201d he said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says\u201cFireworks on the corporate front in conjunction with Berkshire\u2019s announcement of 4Q earnings are unlikely, in our view. Berkshire didn\u2019t make any major acquisitions in the past three months, and share repurchases were probably modest in the quarter.\u201d\u2013Matthew Palazola, senior analystWhile the Oracle of Omaha may address the frustrations of dealmaking and investing in 2019, Buffett often uses the letter as a platform to delve into a wider range of issues too, including the economy, politics and investment fees.Here are some other topics that might come up in the letter:Kraft HeinzOver the past year, a massive writedown, management changes and a regulatory probe at the packaged-food giant caused turmoil for Berkshire, its biggest shareholder. More recently, Kraft Heinz was downgraded to junk by some credit-rating companies, which has weighed on its stock.Following a delay related to the problems at Kraft Heinz, Berkshire\u2019s portion of its earnings are once again included in the conglomerate\u2019s results. Buffett\u2019s company carried its Kraft Heinz stake at a value of US$13.8 billion on its balance sheet at the end of September, almost US$4.7 billion more than the market price at the time. The conglomerate said it\u2019ll continue to monitor the investment for impairment, but didn\u2019t think it was required then.\u201cI have thought they have needed to write down the value of the asset for several quarters now,\u201d Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview. \u201cI am surprised and dismayed that the carrying value has not been reconciled to reality.\u201dGeicoBuffett\u2019s company famously keeps a relatively tight corporate staff, with just 26 employees in the office, so any reshuffling of duties tends to attract investor attention. Late last year, Berkshire named Todd Combs, who helps Buffett oversee investments, to run auto insurer Geico, in addition to his role managing at least US$14 billion in stocks. While Buffett\u2019s deputy worked at Progressive Corp. years ago, most of his career has been spent managing investments.\u201cThat was a really surprising appointment,\u201d said Shanahan of Edward Jones. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t have that kind of experience \u2014 not only running a large organization, but running an insurance company.\u201dCombs knows a lot about auto insurance so the appointment made sense, according to Munger. The auto insurer will increasingly need to figure out how to navigate changing technology, such as artificial intelligence for underwriting, Munger said.Geico has also been facing pressure from rivals including Progressive, which sparked a question from a shareholder at last year\u2019s annual meeting about how Geico stacked up to its competitor. Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations at Berkshire, said Geico has \u201csignificant\u201d advantages in terms of controlling expenses, but that Progressive is better at managing losses.\u201cGeico is very aware of this disadvantage on the loss ratio that they are suffering, and they\u2019re very focused on trying to bridge that gap as quickly as they can,\u201d Jain said at the time.Geico ended up tweaking its strategy last year, building out capabilities long championed by Progressive and Allstate Corp. Geico introduced a telematics offering, which connects cars and phone apps to track drivers\u2019 habits.SuccessionBuffett\u2019s letter always spurs questions about succession for the 89-year-old CEO and his 96-year-old business partner Munger. In 2018, Berkshire appointed two key lieutenants, Jain and Greg Abel, to its board, promotions that Buffett said at the time were movements toward succession.Buffett hasn\u2019t publicly named his successor, a fact that ramps up speculation around any public announcements. Many investors have been focusing on Abel, whose mandate includes overseeing all of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses. Those responsibilities put him in charge of companies from the sprawling energy empire he led for years to retailers Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candies and apparel brands Fruit of the Loom and Brooks Sports.PoliticsBuffett has been carefully navigating the increasingly bifurcated U.S. political climate in recent years. While he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he has yet to endorse a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential race, though he has expressed support for Michael Bloomberg, who\u2019s seeking the Democratic nomination. (Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Buffett\u2019s 2019 letter contained a carefully worded section on how U.S. prosperity has been achieved in a bipartisan manner. He might take a similar approach this year.\u201cHe may say something thinly veiled within the context of the American system and preserving the American system of capitalism,\u201d CFRA\u2019s Seifert said. \u201cHe runs a very large, globally interconnected company. It\u2019s probably not a bad idea for him to be measured in what he says.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Manulife, Sun Life get boost from surging stock market while Asia weighs on outlook", "description": "Manulife and Sun Life Financial each posted a 10 per cent gain in underlying quarterly earnings thanks to improving equity markets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/manulife-sun-life-get-boost-from-surging-stock-market-while-asia-weighs-on-outlook", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/manulife.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 13, 2020 10:27 AM EST", "content": "The surging stock market is serving two of Canada\u2019s largest life insurers well.Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. each posted a 10 per cent gain in underlying quarterly earnings as improving equity markets helped their asset-management divisions, and Sun Life\u2019s fourth-quarter profit beat analysts\u2019 expectations.

But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.\u201cThe relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Dechaine.

The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group.

Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be easy.\u201dThe Debate Over Whether to Call It QE Is Over, and the Fed LostWhile economists only see a 30 per cent chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, Rosenberg said a retreat in spending on restaurants, movies and furnishings and other discretionary spending are harbingers of a slowdown, along with a deceleration in U.S. core inflation.\u201cWhen you stop hearing \u2018where are we going for dinner tonight?\u2019 and instead you start hearing \u2018who\u2019s cooking dinner?\u2019 then you know that a new form of frugality is taking place.\u201dHere\u2019s how he\u2019s battening down the hatches in his model portfolio:Gold\u201cGold is a place you want to be. I think that it\u2019s partly because its inversely correlated with interest rates. But it\u2019s also an insurance policy when things go wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a no-brainer, but this is close.\u201dBullion is off to a roaring start this year as strategists from Goldman Sachs to UBS Group AG called for $1,600 an ounce even before the Iranian crisis impacted global markets. The yellow metal has gained about a third since August 2018 and was trading around $1560 per ounce Monday.JapanJapan\u2019s stock market is one that\u2019s a \u201cblind hold\u201d for Rosenberg. Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor. The country has also pushed companies to distribute dividends, introduce and/or expand share buybacks and have allowed for foreigners on corporate boards as shareholder activism picks up. \u201cThis is revolutionary in Japan.\u201dBonds in DragBond-proxies in the stock market, or what Rosenberg calls \u201cbonds in drag\u201d are also good investments as the economy heads into a downturn. Utilities, REITs and pipelines, which he calls asset-backed cash flow generators, are worth holding.\u201cIt\u2019s really more about putting together a portfolio of stocks \u2014 non-cyclical, liquid, strong balance sheets, with not much of a refinancing calendar that have been able to increase their dividends,\u201d he said.\u201cDownright cheap\u201d energy stocks are also favoured by Rosenberg. \u201cEnergy stocks are not priced for WTI where we are right now. They are priced for something that\u2019s gotta be at least 20 per cent \u2013 30 per cent lower.\u201dDefence stocks are a cheaper way to boost exposure to tech as countries beef up military spending. \u201cDefence is actually a technology. You can buy it at a lower multiple. Everybody is spending more money on military. The one thing that Trump has done, he\u2019s done a lot of stuff, he has successfully pressured the NATO allies to spend more on military.\u201dEnd GameThe Fed\u2019s asset purchases have created \u201cso much liquidity\u201d in global markets that it should be concerned, Rosenberg said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some other solution than just the Fed expanding its balance sheet in perpetuity,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what\u2019s creating this bubble.\u201dThe U.S. and Canadian economies will slow and central banks will cut interest rates. Eventually, the Fed will have to print money and the Treasury will have to distribute it to the public to stimulate growth \u2014 the so-called \u201chelicopter drop\u201d of money.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an end game and it is the magical money tree,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Stock bulls keep calm in Canada, look past flare-up in Iran tensions", "description": "Canada's stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November last week, after reaching a fresh record Thursday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-bulls-keep-calm-in-canada-shaking-off-iranian-tensions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 8:56 PM EST", "content": "If you\u2019ve only just come back from your holiday break and looked at equity markets, you\u2019d think nothing bad happened last week.Canada\u2019s stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November after reaching a fresh record Thursday, while the S&P 500 rose almost 1 per cent. Geopolitical tensions over Iran may have roiled Asian and European markets, but volatility soon faded during U.S. hours and failed to stir Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index much, where gold and energy stocks make up about 20 per cent of the benchmark.\u201cIt was fascinating to me,\u201d said Rose Devli, a portfolio manager at 1832 Asset Management. \u201cThe market was telling you: no this is nothing, this is going to pass and everything is going to pass with a little bit of volatility,\u201d she said at a panel discussion on the 2020 outlook at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office Wednesday. \nDespite utter confusion in Washington, markets can still prevail: U.S. analyst\nOil losing its geopolitical lustre as markets shrug off Iran conflict\nFrom the Middle East to the BoC, Post\u2019s annual outlook lunch tackles the tough questions for 2020\nRelations between Iran and the West deteriorated after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general, Iran struck back with attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq, and a plane crashed near Tehran killing 176 people, including 63 Canadians. The Iranian government admitted Saturday it had mistakenly downed the jet, spreading anger across the globe. That was a dramatic reversal after the regime spent days accusing Western governments of \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201dWeaker-than-expected jobs data from the U.S. did little to alter investor views that the economy remains fundamentally sound, while Canada\u2019s rebound in employment backed the central bank\u2019s view that the labour force continues to be resilient.That left equity bulls still in charge as they continue to look past the flare-up in tensions with Iran and focus on the potential for a pickup in global economic growth. And Canada is still listed as one of the four markets at the top of Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s global equity scorecard for 2020.EconomyCanadian jobs data released Friday showed employment rebounded in December after two straight months of declines. Employment grew by 320,300 this year, the second-most since 2007.\u201cThe small December rebound keeps the 3-month moving average in negative territory at -13K, which implies a slowdown in hiring after a year of strong gains,\u201d said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ben Steverman", "title": "Bill Gates, whose fortune stands at $113 billion, is pushing for higher taxes on the rich", "description": "'I think the rich should pay more than they currently do, and that includes Melinda and me'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/bill-gates-whose-fortune-stands-at-113-billion-is-pushing-for-higher-taxes-on-the-rich", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bill-gates.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 3, 2020 12:01 PM EST", "content": "Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates started the last decade worth more than US$50 billion and a pledge to donate a big chunk of his fortune to charity.By the end of it, he\u2019d given billions of dollars to fight poverty and improve health care and education.

A gauge of fear in the stock market, the Cboe Volatility Index, has gone from 36 a year ago to 12 now.The market closure was more akin to something of a Christmas miracleDavid Joy \n \nThis, in 2019, is what the market is supposed to be like around the holidays. Little news, light trading, small moves and low volume. In the five years prior to 2018\u2019s crash, for instance, the biggest swing in the final trading day before the holiday was a gain of about 0.3 per cent on Christmas Eve 2013.Last year\u2019s pre-Christmas massacre was business as usual for Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors. \u201cI was in that whole time. I didn\u2019t mind. I basically viewed it as being paid to not go to my in-laws,\u201d he said by phone from his San Antonio office. \u201cA lot of the traders we were dealing with were screaming, \u2018Oh, my God, the market is falling! It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any end to it!\u2019\u201dThe holiday may have contributed to the volatility, he said, with lower liquidity making for bigger swings. Many desks likely weren\u2019t fully staffed; senior traders were on vacation. In their absence, \u201cthere will be a lot of junior traders there, who may not be able to initiate a stance on a position, depending on the rules of their firm,\u201d said Matousek. \u201cA junior trader can\u2019t decide, \u2018This is a short-term bottom,\u2019 and start accumulating.\u201dThere's only a few days out of the year where there's really some significant opportunities and that was definitely one of the best ones of the year, even though I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemyBryce Doty \n \nDavid Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, recalled that Christmas Eve \u201chad the look and feel of panic selling, based more on fear rather than any change in fundamentals or outlook.\u201d With that backdrop, the market closure was more akin to something of a Christmas miracle.\u201cChristmas itself gave the market opportunity to take a breather and a second look at things,\u201d he said. The day off \u201ccame at a very opportune time.\u201dAs bad as Christmas Eve was for Wall Street, the day after bred relief. Trump called equities bargains in an Oval Office press conference and the S&P 500 spiked near 5 per cent on Dec. 26, its single best session since March 2009. Joy was among the buyers when the market reopened, purchasing an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 and selling it a few months later for a small gain.Bryce Doty at Sit Investment Associates also presciently saw the bloodbath as a buying opportunity.\u201cWhether I was in the office or not I was working \u2014 these are the times that matter,\u201d said the firm\u2019s senior vice president. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few days out of the year where there\u2019s really some significant opportunities and that was definitely one of the best ones of the year, even though I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy.\u201d\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander and Divya Balji", "title": "Canadian banks had a 'sloppy' end to the year, and 2020 doesn't look like it will be much better", "description": "Banks' weak earnings growth likely to improve little next year, as rising loan losses and eroding margins affect bottom lines", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadian-bank-forecasts-tempered-after-sloppy-end-to-the-year", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/banks-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 12, 2019 9:51 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s banks ended the year with their weakest earnings growth since 2016. There may be little improvement next year, as rising loan losses and eroding margins affect bottom lines.Bank analysts are tempering their forecasts for the next year after a difficult fiscal fourth quarter, when half of Canada\u2019s six largest banks missed expectations. The three months ended Oct. 31 were \u201csloppy\u201d and a \u201cweak end to a tough year,\u201d with 3 per cent adjusted per-share earnings growth among the Big Six banks, CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said. He now expects those lenders to see average earnings growth of 3.5 per cent in fiscal 2020 and 5.1 per cent in 2021.\u201cWe see this outlook as neither negative nor positive at this stage, though it does feel like the risks outnumber the opportunities at this stage in the macroeconomic cycle,\u201d Sedran said in a note to clients this week. \u201cWe think earnings resilience and momentum, with a little help from share buybacks, will help determine the winners in the coming year.\u201d \nBanking watchdog cranks up capital buffer for Canada\u2019s big six, citing risks of household debt and trade tensions\nBranches are making more and more money for Canadian banks, even in the app era\nLower profits, higher loan-loss provisions could be \u2018new normal\u2019 for Canada\u2019s big banks\nScotia Capital analyst Sumit Malhotra lowered his per-share earnings estimates for 2020, and now expects a repeat of the last year, with 3 per cent growth, followed by 6 per cent in 2021. He views stock valuations, at 10.5 times next year\u2019s estimated earnings, and 10 times his 2021 profit forecast, as \u201creasonable given the uncertain growth outlook.\u201d\u201cWe think the sector needs to demonstrate an EPS catalyst in order to improve sentiment towards the stocks,\u201d Malhotra said in a note Monday.The eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has returned 10 per cent so far this year. The index fell 11 per cent last year, after posting an 11 per cent increase in 2017 and a 25 per cent surge in 2016.Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan also cut his forecasts, and now sees 4 per cent growth in 2020 and 5 per cent in 2021. \u201cWe believe annual EPS revisions are an important factor regarding near-term share performance,\u201d he said in a note Wednesday.National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine pared his 2020 earnings expectations for Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for each of the next two fiscal years. He lifted his forecasts for National Bank of Canada for both years. Issues facing the banks include margin pressure from low interest rates and credit, Dechaine said.\u201cWhile credit trends are \u2018normalizing\u2019 as opposed to spiking, domestic indicators such as rising insolvency rates and November\u2019s weak jobs data will likely maintain upward pressure on loan losses,\u201d Dechaine said in a Dec. 8 note. He expects the industry EPS loan-loss rate to rise to 36 basis points in 2020, and 38 basis points in 2021, from 33 basis points in fiscal 2019.Not all forecasts for the industry are so dire. Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, said Wednesday that Canadian banks\u2019 fourth-quarter results \u201cwere fairly uninspiring, to say the least,\u201d with net interest margins and flattening yield curves weighing on the industry, but the future should be brighter.\u201cWe expect yield curves to steepen, so this should improve the profitability of the banks,\u201d Bangsund said on BNN Bloomberg. \u201cFrom a valuation perspective, this is offering some compelling value for investors who are coming back to the market. There\u2019s lot of cash on the sidelines, so we believe this is what investors will be looking for when they position themselves for 2020.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Javier Blas, Dinesh Nair and Matthew Martin", "title": "The Wall Street bankers who burst Saudi Aramco's $2-trillion bubble", "description": "After offering unrealistic valuations to win a place on the deal, the world's most famous banks were unable to deliver", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/the-wall-street-bankers-who-burst-saudi-aramcos-2-trillion-bubble", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/aramco.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 11, 2019 1:21 PM EST", "content": "The chairman of the world\u2019s biggest oil company was about to lose his temper.At a meeting in Riyadh on a sultry October evening, Achintya Mangla, one of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s most senior bankers, had told Yasir Al-Rumayyan there was no way international investors were going to value Saudi Aramco \u2014 just weeks away from an initial public offering \u2014 at US$2 trillion.Al-Rumayyan, who\u2019d risen in just a few years from head of a mid-sized investment bank in Riyadh to one of the most powerful jobs in the global economy, erupted. He unleashed a torrent of expletives in Arabic and English that shocked the roomful of battle-hardened bankers. The chairman was probably worried about telling his boss, the crown prince who locked up many of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people in a five-star hotel just two years ago.In the three and a half years since Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman first proposed an initial public offering of Aramco, the state oil company that pumps 10 per cent of the world\u2019s oil, the US$2 trillion valuation had caused trouble. \nSaudi Aramco overtakes Microsoft, Apple in debut to hit market value of $1.88 trillion\nSaudi Aramco raises $25.6 billion in world\u2019s biggest IPO\n\u2018Do I have the stomach for that?\u2019: Risky Aramco IPO may be a hard sell, especially for Canadian investors\nThe prince, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, had long insisted on the stratospheric valuation, almost double any other business on the planet, and nobody had been able to convince him global investors didn\u2019t agree. Anyone who argued with him got pushed aside, including Khalid Al-Falih, sacked as Aramco chairman and oil minister earlier this year.This account is based on interviews with bankers, consultants, executives, government officials and members of the royal family, many of whom asked not to be identified discussing private meetings and conversations. Aramco, the banks and fund managers all declined to comment.When bankers pitched for a role on the IPO this year, they told Al-Rumayyan what he needed to hear: that US$2 trillion wasn\u2019t out of the question. The range initially pitched by Wall Street was US$1.7 trillion to US$2.4 trillion, according to people involved in the process.But as the sale came closer, the valuation was becoming unsustainable. In September and early October, Aramco\u2019s bankers toured the world informally pitching the deal to fund managers from Boston to London to Tokyo. Everywhere, foreign investors told the company the valuation was too high. In Switzerland, where trillions are managed for the world\u2019s richest people, fund manager Pictet & Cie. had an initial valuation as low as US$800 billion.The bankers took notes. A spreadsheet summarizing feedback, seen by Bloomberg News, is a who\u2019s who of the global fund industry, from Capital Group, a large investor in natural resources, to BlackRock, the biggest fund manager. The consensus from foreign investors was around a valuation of around US$1.2 trillion. A few signalled they could go a bit higher. \u201cUp to US$1.5 trillion based on dividend,\u201d was the feedback from Franklin Templeton, the emerging markets specialist and among the most generous.The problem for many investors was summarized in two words: dividend yield. At US$2 trillion, Aramco would pay shareholders a dividend equivalent to a return of less than 4 per cent on their money, well below what Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp. and other major oil companies pay.\n\nYasser al-Rumayyan, Saudi Aramco\u2019s chairman, speaks during a news conference at the Plaza Conference Center in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, November 3, 2019.\n\nReuters files\n\nInvestors need a much higher yield, requiring a lower valuation. Wellington Asset Management, which controls US$1 trillion in assets, told bankers the dividend yield needed to rise to 7 per cent to 8 per cent to make the company a worthwhile investment, implying a valuation of about US$900 billion.The job of JPMorgan\u2019s Mangla that evening in October was to break the news to the client. Speaking on behalf of the band of banks hired for the deal, he burst the US$2 trillion bubble, according to two people who attended the meeting.Mangla wasn\u2019t the only one who tried to give Al-Rumayyan an unvarnished version of events. Jonathan Penkin, a senior equity capital markets banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was told not to speak at any more meetings after he tried to talk about the valuation later in October, according to people familiar with the discussions. Motassim Al-Ma\u2019Ashouq, the top Aramco executive in charge of the IPO preparations, and the person who had met foreign investors in preparatory talks, was also sidelined.\u201cSaudi Arabia has always had this problem: top-down decision making,\u201d said Karen Young, a Middle East specialist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a specialist in the political economy of the Middle East. \u201cThere\u2019s a culture of fear. Savvy and able technocrats don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up.\u201d\u200bSaudi Arabia also drew a blank with strategic investors, which often agree to buy into an IPO earlier than others, becoming cornerstone shareholders on the deal. Aramco\u2019s banks pitched from China to Singapore, Russia to Malaysia. Everywhere, they got a polite thanks, but no thanks.Al-Rumayyan, 49, who had no experience of the oil and gas industry before becoming Aramco chairman, felt betrayed by the very same Wall Street bankers who had told him that securing a US$2 trillion IPO was possible. Saudi Arabia had a tough choice \u2014 go ahead, lose face and settle for a valuation below US$1.5 trillion and attract foreign investors. Or delay the deal, perhaps forever.Riyadh, keen to restore the kingdom\u2019s standing after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, opted for a third way: ignore foreign investors, and sell the Aramco shares at home. The government would pressure wealthy local families, many of whom had members locked up in Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton in 2017, and bring in a few friends in the Middle East region, including funds controlled by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Even then, it had to compromise on the valuation, settling for US$1.7 trillion.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nAhmed Yosri/Reuters\n\nThe new IPO is a shadow of the initial plan, but still allows the crown prince to claim victory. Last Thursday, Aramco announced it raised a record US$25.6 billion, beating the US$25 billion set by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. The valuation means the world\u2019s most valuable company, until now Apple Inc., will trade in Riyadh not in the U.S.For Wall Street, already stung by the collapse of WeWork\u2019s IPO and Uber Technology Inc.\u2019s chronic under-performance, Aramco is another embarrassment. After offering unrealistic valuations to win a place on the deal, the world\u2019s most famous banks were unable to deliver, attracting scorn from their client and derision from investors. Now, many banks face the prospect of not getting paid for nearly four years of work.The fact the IPO happened at all this year was a surprise.The deal has been in the works since early 2016, when Prince Mohammed told The Economist newspaper he thought privatization would aid his Vision 2030 campaign to modernize the oil-dependent Saudi economy. But the sale, initially scheduled for 2018, was delayed several times as the Saudi leadership grappled with where to list it and how much it was worth.By the start of this year, then Aramco chairman and oil minister, Al-Falih, believed the IPO was in the deep freeze and he hoped the deal would go away for good. But the crown prince and Al-Rumayyan, who headed the sovereign wealth fund that would get the proceeds, were still keen. He sought advice.\n\nFormer Aramco chairman and oil minister Al-Falih.\n\nChris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg files\n\nThroughout the stop-start IPO, one banker played a key role, although he rarely sought the limelight. The boutique operation of Michael Klein, a veteran Wall Street dealmaker who\u2019d gone out on his own when he wasn\u2019t made CEO of Citigroup Inc. during the financial crisis, advised Aramco directly, helping the company\u2019s chairman to select the banks which would handle the IPO. Alongside Lazard Ltd. and Moelis & Co., Al-Rumayyan appointed his firm as an independent financial adviser.If anyone could have warned Al-Rumayyan that Wall Street was inflating the Aramco valuation to win the IPO mandate, it was the ever-present Klein. He never did. According to several people, Klein thwarted attempts to have a discussion with the Saudi government about the valuation.Another boutique bank, Evercore Inc., who worked on the IPO from 2016 to 2018, didn\u2019t return. One of their top bankers, David Waring, warned the kingdom early in the process the US$2 trillion was going to be very hard to achieve. Second time around, they ensured they weren\u2019t on the deal by proposing a fee Aramco refused to pay.While work on the IPO had slowed to a crawl, the crown prince was still insisting the sale take place by early 2021. But in the summer, Al-Rumayyan became anxious the U.S.-China trade war was going to cause an economic slowdown, sending crude prices tumbling and ruling out an IPO for several years.\u201cThe royal palace panicked thinking oil prices were about to crash,\u201d said a person who has worked on the IPO for nearly four years. \u201cThey saw two options: rush the IPO immediately, or forget about it until much, much later.\u201dFirst, Saudi Arabia tried to juice the oil market, cutting production to 9.6 million barrels a day, more than 700,000 barrels a day below its official OPEC quota. For the kingdom, it was an unprecedented move. Even so the price of oil briefly dropped to close to US$55 a barrel in August, below the US$60 to US$70 a barrel range that was needed to support the IPO.Al-Rumayyan, convinced time was running out, decided the deal needed to be fast-tracked, persuading Prince Mohammed that if he wanted an IPO, he should put him in charge.Paid the PriceAl-Falih, who mixed administrative ability with an abrasive style, paid the price for his opposition. He was removed as Aramco chairman on Sept. 3 and replaced by Al-Rumayyan. (He was replaced as oil minister a few weeks later.) The IPO\u2019s champion now sat at the head of the company.With little time to organize the deal, Aramco ruled out an international listing. But Al-Rumayyan still wanted to bring billions in international money into Saudi Arabia. To ensure success \u2014 and positive coverage from analysts \u2014 he hired almost every bank on Wall Street including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan.Al-Rumayyan and Amin Nasser, the Aramco CEO, thought the IPO would be fairly easy. Only a few months earlier, the company had sold its first \u2014 massively oversubscribed \u2014 international bond.Perhaps blinded by that success, Aramco walked into the IPO under-prepared. Despite four years of work, executives still struggled to answer simple questions from foreign investors, its legal team couldn\u2019t produce documents on time, and nobody at Aramco could convincingly explain why Aramco deserved its US$2-trillion valuation.Then in the early hours of Sept. 14, a fleet of drones attacked the very heart of the Saudi oil industry \u2014 the giant crude processing plant at Abqaiq in the kingdom\u2019s eastern desert. Half of Aramco\u2019s production was knocked out in minutes.Blamed IranThe kingdom blamed Iran for the attack, but said there would be no interruption in oil supplies to customers around the world. Oil traders, looking at photos of punctured tanks and mangled pipework, were skeptical. Many assumed the IPO would have to be delayed.Prince Mohammed told advisers a delay would be a victory for Iran. The new oil minister, the crown prince\u2019s half-brother Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and Aramco CEO Nasser promised the damage could be fixed in weeks. Bankers on the IPO were told to keep working.Saudi Arabia did everything they could to boost the valuation: tax rates were cut further and investors were offered incentives to buy the shares. The intention to float was finally announced by Al-Rumayyan and Nasser on Nov. 4.\n\nParticipants celebrate during the official ceremony marking the debut of Saudi Aramco\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) on the Riyadh\u2019s stock market, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, December 11, 2019.\n\nMarwa Rashad/Reuters\n\nBut the feedback from international investors didn\u2019t improve. At a meeting in the early hours of Nov. 17, Saudi Arabia decided to scale back the size of the IPO and scrap plans to market the shares internationally. A roadshow in London and other financial capitals was scrapped. The Wall Street banks, who\u2019d fought so hard to get a mandate, were dumped.The deal became what Prince Abdulaziz, the oil minister, described as \u201cour family and friends\u201d IPO, relying on local retail investors, rich Saudis and regional governments. The Saudi government even spent more than US$2 billion of its own cash buying shares. An unsuccessful attempt was even made to persuade Qatar \u2014 under economic blockade by Riyadh \u2014 to make a large investment.The deal got done. Prince Mohammed might even get his wish. In a press conference at OPEC\u2019s Vienna HQ Prince Abdulaziz scolded the international press for their coverage of the IPO and said the company would trade at more than US$2 trillion in a few months.

First announced in an interview with Economist in January 2016, the IPO came after a tumultuous period that included the murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of prominent Saudis in Riyadh\u2019s Ritz Carlton. The sale ultimately fell short of the US$100 billion international offering with a valuation of US$2 trillion that the prince once proposed.Saudi officials pulled out all the stops to ensure that the stock traded higher after an offering that international investors largely rejected, citing the valuation and concerns including governance issues and possible security threats. The stock price also should be underpinned by demand from index-tracking funds, since Aramco will be added to emerging-market benchmarks. \nHow Enbridge plans to grow in the age of pipeline opposition \u2014 and connect Canadian oil to world markets\nOPEC+ poised for Saudi quid pro quo: We cut oil production if you stop cheating\nWhile Canada hesitates, Russia builds 3,000 km gas pipeline to China in just five years\n\u201cAramco should easily get to the US$2 trillion valuation as soon as tomorrow; there is plenty of appetite for it,\u201d said Marie Salem, the head of institutions at Daman Securities in Dubai. \u201cAnd more money should flow soon with the international index inclusions. The start couldn\u2019t be better.\u201dAramco, the world\u2019s largest oil producer, is so big that it easily dwarfs the rest of the companies in the Saudi market, which have a combined value of about US$500 billion. Adding in Aramco at its current market value, the kingdom\u2019s bourse becomes the world\u2019s seventh-biggest stock market, overtaking Canada, Germany and India. Saudi Arabia, though, only sold 1.5 per cent of the company\u2019s capital, meaning that barely any of its shares will trade.Final orders surpassed US$119 billion, with authorities allowing lenders to boost loans beyond usual to support the sale.Not everyone is convinced the share price surge will last. Many international investors are avoiding the stock because of environmental, social and governance concerns, while others say the company is overvalued given its dividend yield versus peers.\u201cFundamentally, especially when taking ESG considerations into account, the valuation is stretched,\u201d said Siddharth Sanghvi, head of emerging markets equity research at Amundi.Aramco has promised a bumper dividend payment of a minimum US$75 billion a year until at least 2024. That implies a yield of about 3.9 per cent, much less generous than peers BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yet also high enough to threaten to stretch the company\u2019s finances if crude prices fall.Aramco\u2019s IPO relied on some of the kingdom\u2019s richest families, who had members detained in the Ritz hotel during a so-called crackdown on corruption in 2017, and also on cash from neighbouring allies such as the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. Gulf Cooperation Council investors are confident the stock price has plenty of room to increase, boosted by incentives that go from bonus shares to the fast inclusion in emerging-market benchmarks.Wealthy Saudis were pressed to buy shares after the start of trading to make the IPO a success, the Financial Times reported Tuesday.A surge in early trading validates \u201cour thesis that Aramco\u2019s pricing fell short of US$2 trillion to leave upside on the table for Saudi and GCC investors, allowing them to benefit from the listing of Saudi\u2019s crown jewel,\u201d said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd., which bought shares in the IPO through three funds.Goldman Sachs Group Inc., acting as share stabilizing manager, has the right to exercise an option to sell another 450 million shares. It could be executed in whole or in part up to 30 calendar days after trading begins. The previous largest IPO, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., rose 38 per cent in its trading debut in 2014.The Aramco IPO proceeds will be transferred to the Public Investment Fund, which has made a number of bold investments, including into SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Vision Fund and a US$3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies Inc. Saudi authorities flagged this week that \u201ca lot\u201d of the money will be spent in the domestic economy.The proceeds of the Aramco deal alone are equal to more than a decade of IPOs on Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange, which has already said that the company\u2019s weighting in the main local benchmark will be capped at 15 per cent. And even though Aramco\u2019s free float is among the lowest globally, the deal opens up one of the world\u2019s most secretive companies, one that bankrolled Saudi Arabia and its rulers for decades, but until this year had never published financial statements or borrowed in international debt markets.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Blowout out year for ETFs in Canada as inflows near record amid 'blind optimism'", "description": "ETF inflows have hit $23 billion in 2019 and are inching closer to the record set two years ago at $26 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/funds/etfs-are-nearing-record-inflows-in-canada-amid-blind-optimism", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/etfs.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 9, 2019 5:01 AM EST", "content": "With less than a month left, Canada\u2019s ETF industry is heading for a blowout year with inflows poised for a record and assets crossing the $200 billion (US$151 billion) mark.Exchange traded funds attracted $4.5 billion of investments in November \u2014 the biggest monthly increase for the year \u2014 pushing inflows to $23 billion in 2019 and inching closer to the record set two years ago at $26 billion, according to National Bank of Canada.

Meantime, the clock kept ticking towards Dec. 15, when Trump has threatened to impose 15 per cent levies on US$160 billion of Chinese imports.With about two weeks to go on the China front, the Trump administration Monday hit Brazil and Argentina with steel tariffs and proposed levies on France as punishment over a tax that\u2019s hit large American tech companies.Moves by self-styled Tariff Man Monday were enough to trigger the biggest Wall Street sell-off in eight weeks \u2014 with a little help from a weak U.S. manufacturing report.\u201cI have no deadline,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday in London when asked if he wanted an agreement by year end. Stocks fell.The U.S. president suggested that in some ways, it might be better to wait until after the November election.The following are the views of a number of market participants on what happens if the tariffs on China kick in Dec. 15.\u2018Gloomy Future\u2019It will be \u201cdefinitely risk-off across the screen,\u201d Tongli Han, chief investment officer at Deepblue Global Investment, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cWhat happened recently makes this trade deal more costly for Chinese leaders \u2014 so I\u2019m seeing a gloomy future for the short term, one-to-two months.\u201dBetter Luck Next YearWith the clock running down on 2019 and a prospects of a trade deal looking more remote it\u2019s time for investors to take a little bit of risk off the table, said Steve Brice, chief investment strategist at Standard Chartered private bank, on Bloomberg TV.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to be pushed to the beginning of next year at the best case,\u201d Brice said. The message to investors is \u201cmaybe trim a little bit of equity exposure, or certainly not chase the market at this stage. But look to do so in the next few weeks if we see a 5-to-7 per cent pullback.\u201dLonger term, Brice remains optimistic \u201cthe U.S. and China will still strike a deal of some sort. That will reduce uncertainty and help the global economy do well.\u201dOptimism DashedFor Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, a key concern is markets have already priced in the prospect of a trade deal that has yet to be signed.\u201cThere had been a lot of optimism built in around a trade deal and it\u2019s still the thing that will weigh on markets over the coming months,\u201d Craig said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cIn the meantime we need to see more of a pick-up in the global economy to really offset some of those uncertainties.\u201dBuy the DipFor some, the retreat in equities at the start of the week already presents a buying opportunity.\u201cI\u2019d fade the correction today,\u201d Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore, told Bloomberg TV.The renewed tariff pressures on South America and Europe are likely an effort to bolster Trump\u2019s \u201ctariff man\u201d image ahead of a trade deal with China, he said.\u201cWith the economy in a very delicate situation, if this came on, it would seriously ratchet up the risk of a recession \u2014 and the White House wouldn\u2019t want this situation going into the 2020 presidential election next year,\u201d Lee said.\u2018Wild Day\u2019There may be some massive initial market swings in store, said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group Ltd. in a note to clients.\u201cWe could face a wild day,\u201d he said. The S&P 500 is likely to fall about 2 per cent, with currencies including the yuan, Australian dollar and Korean won also likely to move, he said.

The cuts will affect about 5 per cent of Bank of Montreal\u2019s workforce, executives said on a fiscal fourth-quarter conference call Tuesday. That would equate to about 2,300 positions, based on the company\u2019s year-end headcount.\u201cThis is a sizable move,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said on the call, while announcing earnings that beat analysts\u2019 expectations. \u201cWe\u2019re on a new path as far as a continuous improvement of the operating efficiency of the bank and this charge is designed to accelerate that path as we go forward.\u201d \nBank of Montreal hikes dividend as profit beats expectations on strength in personal banking\nScotiabank kicks off earnings season with modest 1.6% profit growth\nScotiabank expects \u2018high single digit\u2019 growth in foreign business after year of weaker gains\nThe latest restructuring charge \u2014 which follows one taken in the second quarter of 2018, also tied to severances \u2014 included a small amount of real-estate related costs and is part of White\u2019s efforts to improve productivity at what has been Canada\u2019s least-efficient bank. The company\u2019s adjusted efficiency ratio, a measure of what it costs to produce a dollar of revenue, was 60 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 62.2 per cent a year earlier, as the lender moves toward White\u2019s target of 58 per cent or better by the end of fiscal 2021.\u201cIt is difficult for us to credit good expense control in the face of yet another restructuring charge from this bank, this time approaching $500 million,\u201d CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, the underlying segment performance was solid with improving volume growth, positive operating leverage and stable credit quality. A decent result.\u201dBank of Montreal shares fell 1.8 per cent to $98.88 at 9:38 a.m. in Toronto. They have gained 11 per cent this year, compared with a 13 per cent increase for Canada\u2019s eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Deeper CutThe job cuts are across all areas of the bank and are deeper than previous rounds of reductions, including the elimination of 1,850 jobs, or 4 per cent of the workforce, in May 2016, and the 1,000 positions cut in 2007. The latest move comes about six months after the Toronto-based company pared about 100 jobs across its capital-markets division.The reductions surpass Bank of Nova Scotia\u2019s 1,500 job cuts, announced in 2014, and the 1,660 positions eliminated by Royal Bank of Canada in 2004. Those were among the Canadian banking industry\u2019s biggest cuts in the past two decades.Bank of Montreal\u2019s restructuring costs contributed to a 30 per cent decline in net income in the quarter, with the company posting earnings of $1.19 billion, or $1.78 a share. Adjusted per-share earnings were $2.43, beating the $2.41 average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank raised its quarterly dividend 2.9 per cent to $1.06 a share.Wealth ManagementWealth management led profit growth in the quarter, with a 22 per cent increase in earnings from the year earlier, while Canadian and U.S. banking also gained. Earnings from the company\u2019s BMO Capital Markets unit fell 9.7 per cent amid a tougher year for dealmaking.Also in the earnings announcement:Wealth management had its best quarter for profit growth since last year, with earnings of $267 million, helping lift annual net income to $1.06 billion. The bank aims to get $2 billion in annual profit from wealth management by 2023. Earnings from Canadian personal-and-commercial banking, Bank of Montreal\u2019s biggest business, rose 6.2 per cent to $716 million. In the U.S. banking division, which includes Chicago-based BMO Harris Bank, earnings climbed 5.6 per cent to $393 million in the quarter, even after the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Net interest margins in the U.S. division narrowed to 3.35 per cent, the lowest since at least 2010. Earnings from BMO Capital Markets fell 9.7 per cent to $269 million on a decline in revenue from investment banking fees and trading.

But 2019 has been challenging and CIBC\u2019s drive to continue increasing earnings is under threat, with Dodig warning investors in May to expect \u201crelatively flat\u201d growth this fiscal year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question we haven\u2019t achieved the same level of performance in the first three quarters of 2019,\u201d Dodig said in an email. \u201cWhile it\u2019s tempting to change course when things get tough, we must take a long-term view of our strategy and focus on creating long-term value.\u201dCIBC\u2019s mixed messages on mortgages and acquisitions are examples of issues that have confused investors, said Steve Belisle, a senior portfolio manager with Manulife Investment Management.\u201cIt feels like management can\u2019t really have a strategy and stick to it,\u201d said Belisle, who holds CIBC along with other Canadian banks. \u201cThey keep changing what they\u2019re saying and keep changing what they\u2019re doing, depending on what they think their stock price will benefit from.\u201dThe US$5-billion takeover of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp in June 2017 \u2014 CIBC\u2019s largest acquisition in its 152-year history, and a move designed to counter investor concerns that the bank is too Canadian \u2014 was criticized by those expecting a smaller deal.U.S. DealsWhen Dodig took over in 2014, he earmarked as much as $2 billion (US$1.8 billion) for U.S. wealth-management deals. Within two years, that swelled to a $4-billion budget for deals that could include private banking or a commercial lender. PrivateBancorp exceeded that, though CIBC was hurt by bad timing: Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory drove bank stock prices up, forcing CIBC to increase its initial US$3.8-billion offer to win over PrivateBancorp investors.\u201cWe needed capabilities on both sides of the border to grow key client relationships, and we\u2019re pleased the acquisition became accretive well ahead of schedule,\u201d Dodig said in an emailed statement. \u201cI would do this deal again any day.\u201dCIBC\u2019s U.S. push comes years after bigger rivals Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal made substantial forays south of the border and reaped rewards from the American exposure, giving them rising profits and diversification beyond their home turf.Dodig has made other changes to recast CIBC. He pursued small deals to build up its U.S. capital-markets operation and sold some businesses. This month, CIBC agreed to pare ownership in CIBC FirstCaribbean by selling a 67 per cent stake, though at a reduced value from its earlier investment. He\u2019s moving the bank to new headquarters after a century at Toronto\u2019s financial district, leasing as much as 1.75 million square feet at a nearby complex under construction called CIBC Square.Dodig\u2019s challenge is convincing investors he\u2019s moving in the right direction.\u201cWe recognize there have been cases where we could have more clearly communicated with investors and we\u2019ll take that feedback and act on it \u2014 because we have the right strategy and we need to ensure it is consistently articulated and well understood,\u201d Dodig said.Ironically, the bank\u2019s poor share performance \u2014 CIBC has become the cheapest Canadian bank stock based on price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 may make the stock more attractive.\u201cEverybody has noticed the underperformance and CIBC now has a smaller valuation than National Bank, and that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u201d Baskin\u2019s Schwartz said, adding that he\u2019s thinking about buying shares. \u201cThis could be the one to break out.

The Toronto-based lender traded at $28.86 at 1:26 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and has been hovering at levels last seen in February 2017, before the stock plunged as Ontario\u2019s securities regulator accused the company of misleading shareholders over falsified mortgage applications.Alternative lenders including Home Capital and Equitable Group Inc. have seen their stocks surge this year as the pace of mortgage growth picked up during the spring home-buying season, and home sales recovered in major cities including Toronto and Vancouver. \nHome Capital gives Canada\u2019s mortgage-backed market a boost\nHousing market flashing \u2018encouraging signs,\u2019 Home Capital CEO says\nThe smartest guy in the room: How pension guru worked his magic, beat the market and saved Home Capital\nThe \u201csignificant\u201d share price appreciation of the alternative lenders is reflective of improving housing conditions \u2014 particularly in Greater Toronto \u2014 as well as a benign credit environment and robust mortgage growth outlook, CIBC analyst Marco Giurleo said in a Nov. 1 note to clients.

That\u2019s broadening the appeal of a technology that allows vehicles to run on the universe\u2019s most abundant element, releasing only water and heat as byproducts.\u201cThere\u2019s been a real change over the last 12 months,\u201d said Randy MacEwen, chief executive officer of Ballard, based in Burnaby just outside of Vancouver. In parts of Europe, operating a fuel cell-powered electric bus is now cost competitive with a traditional fuel-burning version, he says. Use of the technology is diversifying into ships, trains and forklifts. \nHere are the 30 best performing stocks in Canada over the past three years. Half aren\u2019t on the S&P/TSX index\nBallard Power Systems signs deal to provide power modules for ferry in Norway\nChina accelerates electric vehicle strategy with investments in B.C. clean energy firms\nBallard is the second-best performing stock on Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index this year, pushing its market value to $1.7 billion (US$1.3 billion). It\u2019s more than doubled after scoring a Chinese investor and burgeoning speculation that wide-scale adoption of hydrogen fuel cells may at long last be around the corner.A string of deals this year have indicated the technology is penetrating the traditional automotive industry:Power company Cummins Inc. \u2014 synonymous with the diesel engine for most of its century-old history \u2014 bought Canadian fuel-cell maker Hydrogenics Corp. for US$290 million in September.A truck maker controlled by Italy\u2019s billionaire Agnelli family, CNH Industrial NV, agreed to invest US$250 million in Nikola Motor, a startup aiming to put hydrogen semi-trucks on the road.Robert Bosch GmbH, the world\u2019s largest auto-parts supplier, in April announced plans to mass produce fuel cells by 2022 in partnership with Powercell Sweden AB.\u201cI think the understanding of the value proposition is much stronger today,\u201d says MacEwen, referring to the edge that hydrogen has particularly in commercial vehicles: refuelling with hydrogen is just as fast as filling up a truck or bus with diesel, while batteries can get too heavy when scaled up for larger vehicles.Ballard believes it has around a 70 per cent to 80 per cent market share of the 3,000 fuel-cell buses and trucks currently deployed globally. It\u2019s focusing heavily on Europe where the cost of a fuel-cell bus has plunged to 375,000 euros (US$417,000) from about 1 million euros in five years. MacEwen expects a quarter of key European cities to deploy fuel-cell buses by 2025.Chinese InvestorThe company\u2019s stock price has also soared since a decision last year by China\u2019s Weichai Power Co., a major diesel-engine maker, to buy a 20 per cent stake in the company for US$163 million, making it Ballard\u2019s top shareholder. Robert Brown, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets in Minneapolis, called it a \u201cblockbuster deal\u201d that positions fuel-cell technology to further penetrate the world\u2019s biggest vehicle market.That market could boom with growing government support: vehicle manufacturers, gas suppliers, and other private-sector institutions have announced more than US$17 billion in hydrogen fuel-cell investments as of June, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a report last month.China plans to subsidize the large-scale deployment of hydrogen cars and invest in refueling infrastructure, seeking to replicate the cost reductions and economies of scale that have made the country the biggest market for electric vehicles, according to the BNEF report.Reverse EngineeringBallard\u2019s success in China is a bright spot at a time of dimming business prospects for Canadian companies in China. Canada-China relations have frayed since Canada\u2019s arrest on a U.S. extradition request of Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s chief financial officer. Huawei has been at the centre of U.S. concerns about Chinese intellectual property theft and national security risks.Ballard itself has seen would-be Chinese competitors trying to reverse engineer its fuel-cell technology, MacEwen says. \u201cI personally have seen a facility in China that looked very similar to ours.\u201dSo far the Chinese firms have only been able to make the technology work for a short period of time, he says. Ballard has buses in the field that have been operating for 35,000 hours \u2014 in contrast, the typical hydrogen fuel-cell powered passenger car is designed for just 5,000 hours of durability.Long RoadThe company has kept control in Canada of its core technology \u2014 the membrane electrode assembly known as the heart of a fuel cell.\u201cWe\u2019ve invested over US$1 billion in our core intellectual property and so it\u2019s going to take someone a significant investment and a significant period of time in order to get to where we are today,\u201d he says. \u201cBy that time, of course, we\u2019ve moved the yardsticks on our technology.\u201dStill, skepticism over the technology remains, not least for the pumping infrastructure that would be required to build out the industry.At the end of 2018, there were only about 10,000 passenger fuel cell vehicles on the road globally, according to BNEF, which doesn\u2019t expect the technology to gain any significant share of the passenger fleet over the next two decades. It does see a growing role for fuel cells in the long-haul, heavy-duty trucking area that Ballard focuses on, but says scaling up the required infrastructure and bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen production will mean that progress is slow.Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk has said hydrogen\u2019s shortcomings make it a dead-end for vehicles. \u201cFuel cells should be renamed \u2018fool cells,\u2019 he said in 2013.Stock Overvalued?Ballard has already been on a long road of unfulfilled potential. The company traces its roots back to 1979. During the tech boom in 2000 its shares approached $200 but it\u2019s never posted a profit.

It could be last year\u2019s fourth-quarter sell-off that\u2019s prompting investor anxiety about a possible rehash this time around.

Financials make up nearly 33 per cent of Canada\u2019s benchmark. Oil stocks, which account for more than 10 per cent of the gauge, have also been the pariahs of the market.After climbing more than 12 per cent at the start of the year, Canada\u2019s benchmark stock gauge gained less than 2 per cent in each of the two subsequent quarters. That\u2019s still the longest quarterly rally since March 2017.\u201cSeptember was an important inflection point for the TSX,\u201d said Tina Normann, technical research analyst at Eight Capital. \u201cThe composite broke out to new highs driven by financials.

Suddenly, everyone is asking the same question: what does it mean?The machine of liquidity management is just not oiled anymoreGLMX Chief Executive Officer Glenn Havlicek \n \nThe answer is sobering. Despite assurances by the Fed and others to the contrary, the stress in the market for repurchase agreements, or repos, has exposed some fundamental weaknesses in the nation\u2019s financial system which have been a decade in the making. While they don\u2019t pose a significant problem during good times, the risk is clear: without a permanent fix, sudden cash shortages could lead to broader financial market turmoil in a downturn.\u201cThe machine of liquidity management is just not oiled anymore,\u201d GLMX Chief Executive Officer Glenn Havlicek, who runs a trading platform for repo securities and has four decades of experience in funding markets. \n\u2018This is crazy\u2019: Here is how the repo rate panic that everybody is talking about went down\n\u2018Contagious selloff\u2019 will see U.S. markets plunge 16 per cent by end of year: Capital Economics\nDon\u2019t let record highs fool you: The TSX\u2019s returns are still \u2018pathetic,\u2019 money managers say\nThe repo market is important because it serves as the grease that keeps the global capital markets spinning. In a repo, firms borrow cash from each other by putting up securities like Treasuries as collateral. When the agreement expires, the borrower \u201crepurchases\u201d the collateral and returns the cash, though in practice repos are often rolled over day after day.Hedge funds often use repos to finance purchases of higher-yielding assets, while dealers that are obligated to bid for Treasuries at U.S. debt auctions use them as a way to avoid putting up their own capital.Participants point the finger at two structural changes that have drained too much cash from the system and made the repo market more prone to seizing up: crisis-era monetary policies and financial regulations designed to curb risk-taking. They contend that those two forces, rather than a mere confluence of technical factors, are what\u2019s really behind this past week\u2019s disruptions.Banks have a tremendous amount of liquidity, but also have a tremendous amount of restraints on how they use that liquidityJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon \n \nThe first has to do with the unwinding of the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing program, or QE. Simply put, after buying trillions of dollars of bonds to pump cheap money into the banking system, the Fed reversed course and started reducing its holdings (and thus draining cash) in October 2017 as the economy strengthened. It stopped altogether last month.The problem is that, in reducing the asset side of its ledger, the Fed has also had to shrink its liabilities to balance its balance sheet. Those liabilities consist of currency in circulation, which has naturally increased with the economy, and bank reserves, which have fallen.Of course, that in itself wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause a scarcity of cash in the banking system since firms in aggregate still have over a trillion dollars in reserves. But because of post-crisis rules such as Dodd-Frank and Basel III, banks have been forced to set aside much of those same reserves to meet the more stringent requirements, putting a strain on the available cash they can use. What\u2019s more, capital constraints have made taking large positions in short-term money markets far less lucrative.\u201cThe Fed wanted the market to restructure to a new equilibrium and institutions to figure out how to fund themselves,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives. But \u201cif you have an excess reserve system, you are by definition a primary source of liquidity. And when you squeeze funding markets, you are usually squeezing hedge funds and other investors that may have to cut positions which can spark broader volatility.\u201dJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon summed up the conundrum last week, saying that \u201cbanks have a tremendous amount of liquidity, but also have a tremendous amount of restraints on how they use that liquidity.\u201dThe swelling U.S. deficit caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts hasn\u2019t helped matters. For one, the money that investors and dealers lend to the government in the form of bond purchases takes money out of the banking system. For another, dealers at Treasury auctions have increasingly turned from lenders to borrowers in the repo market to absorb the additional supply. This year, net issuance will reach roughly US$1.2 trillion, after US$1.3 trillion last year, according to JPMorgan. In 2017, it was less than half that.Those liquidity constraints came into full view over the past few days when corporate tax payments, big Treasury auctions and manoeuvres by financial firms to manage their capital requirements prior to quarter-end drained cash available for repo transactions. The overnight lending rate quickly shot up to 10 per cent and the Fed temporarily lost control of its benchmark rate.In the past, the Fed has disputed the idea that its balance-sheet unwind left bank reserves in short supply. And at his post-policy news conference on Sept. 18, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sidestepped questions about whether he felt bank regulations were a catalyst for the market turmoil.Instead, the Fed has opted for a temporary fix. On Friday, the New York Fed announced a series of overnight and term operations over the next three weeks to boost short-term liquidity. That follows four straight days of repo transactions, something it hasn\u2019t done in a decade.A number of investors, strategists and at least one former Fed official have come out to warn that more may need to be done.\u201cMaybe we have gotten some hints that reserves are no longer ample,\u201d said Michael Feroli, JPMorgan\u2019s chief economist. \u201cThe longer the Fed goes without making changes, the more often you might have these type of incidences.\u201dEarlier this year, TD Securities\u2019 Priya Misra predicted the Fed would have to resume its bond purchases as a permanent solution. She says this past week\u2019s events have convinced many of her skeptical clients to come around to the idea. They are now asking her \u201chow much\u201d the Fed will need to buy.While no decisions have been made, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren acknowledged last week that permanently expanding the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is one option on the table and the one he personally prefers. (The other two being continued ad-hoc interventions or a so-called standing repo facility, which would make cash loans available on a daily basis.)Growing the balance sheet might also be the easier one, some strategists say. Pumping cheap cash into the financial system has historically come with the risk of spurring too much inflationary pressure, but after a decade of ultra-low inflation, that isn\u2019t much of a concern today.And the fact the New York Fed stumbled out of the gate as it tried to come to the rescue on Tuesday shows just how out of practice the institution is when it comes to those types of ad-hoc operations, according to GMLX\u2019s Havlicek.\u201cThe repo market isn\u2019t used to being prime time,\u201d in terms of liquidity management, he said.

Wall Street dealers scurried to protect their clients \u2014 and themselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-a50ed754b411c1bcfcd85dcca624605e-5ebcb3353cae4');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-a50ed754b411c1bcfcd85dcca624605e-5ebcb3353cae4');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-a50ed754b411c1bcfcd85dcca624605e-5ebcb3353cae4'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nInside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the powerful markets group had already been canvassing dealers about lending rates. By 10:10 a.m., after an initial, embarrassing misstep, the Fed was pumping US$53.2 billion into the market to calm nerves and regain control over interest rates \u2014 its first intervention since the dark days of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and the rest.\n\nA financial news update in Canary Wharf on September 15, 2008 in London, England. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve pumped US$53.2 billion into the market to calm nerves and regain control over interest rates \u2014 its first intervention since the dark days of Lehman Brothers.\n\nCate Gillon/Getty Images\n\nThe whirlwind day left traders with a host of questions, including the big one: Now what? Shortly after 4 p.m., the Fed announced it would intervene with another repurchase operation on Wednesday.\u201cToday was a bit of a watershed event,\u201d said John Fath, managing partner at BTG Pactual Asset Management.Plumbing ProblemOvernight financing is a basic function, but it\u2019s so sensitive that many Wall Street dealers and corporate treasurers decline to talk openly about it. Privately, market participants likened the events of the past few days to to a plumbing problem \u2014 the result of forces that, for most people, are largely hidden from view.Unlike in 2008, Tuesday\u2019s abrupt rise in short-term rates wasn\u2019t evidence that the financial system was in trouble. Rather, it was the result of a confluence of forces, including corporate tax payments and big Treasury auctions and, ultimately, the swelling U.S. budget deficit. \nDavid Rosenberg: Get ready for the loonie and rates to fall, because our economy is sputtering\nWhy negative interest rates in the U.S. would be the real \u2018bonehead\u2019 move\nCanada, U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand only major bond markets now without negative rates \u2014 if they go, we\u2019re in trouble\nMark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Bank of America, saw it coming. He warned in a Sept. 13 note that the so-called dollar funding markets were about to be tested.Corporations had to withdraw cash from money market funds and bank accounts to make quarterly tax payments, while Treasury buyers had to settle up with Uncle Sam for recent purchases. On Friday alone, about US$20.4 billion flowed out of money-market funds, according to Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC.Such technicalities aside, the developments nonetheless showed the Fed was losing control over short-term lending, one of its tools for implementing the monetary policy that helps guide the entire economy.The market was so topsy-turvy that the effective fed funds rate rose, even as economists predict the central bank will reduce the benchmark at its policy-making meeting on Wednesday.The tumult also points to another worrisome sign: Wall Street is struggling to absorb record sales of Treasury bonds and bills that the Trump administration is using to fund a growing budget deficit. What\u2019s more, many dealers have curtailed trading because of reforms implemented after 2008, making markets more prone to volatility.Growing PressureTuesday\u2019s intervention marked the culmination of days of growing strains. Everyone knew pressure was building, said the head of rates financing at one major bank. But few expected a spike like this.By early Tuesday morning, dealers were whispering that the overnight repo rate would open at about 6 per cent, well above the 3.5 per cent where it had closed the night before.It was even worse than the dealers had feared \n \nAs usual, Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, was making daily calls to check that counterparties were executing transactions at the prevailing market rate. Some of them were quoting 3 per cent. Sabatino knew the clearing rate was much higher \u2014 between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.\u201cIt\u2019s normal price discovery, but now complicated when the market is in flux,\u201d he said.Then, at 7:38 a.m., the bid-ask spread flashed on dealing screens: 8 per cent \u2013 6 per cent.It was even worse than the dealers had feared.The message was clear: the Fed would have to step in like it used in the days before the financial crisis \n \nThe repo rate kept rising, eventually reaching as high as 10 per cent. By 9 a.m., a half hour before the stock market was to open, the fed funds rate was bumping up against the Fed\u2019s upper limit.The message was clear: the Fed would have to step in like it used in the days before the financial crisis. At 9:17, the Fed confirmed what everyone already suspected: it would conduct an overnight repurchase agreement operation from 9:30 to 9:45. The move would inject as much as US$75 billion of liquidity into the market.Then, messages began flying across Wall Street. Rumours swirled that the Fed operation had been abruptly canceled. Only this wasn\u2019t a rumour: the Fed was having technical problems.The timing was horrible. New York Fed President John Williams, senior vice president of market operations Lorie Logan and first vice president Michael Strine were all expected in Washington for the two-day central bank meeting.With anxiety growing, the Fed bumped the time to 10 a.m. Within 15 minutes, it injected US$53.2 billion, bringing rates back down, at least for a time.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked a worse day for this to happen,\u201d said Thomas Simons, senior economist at Jefferies LLC.It had been more than a decade since traders at the central bank jumped into U.S. money markets to add cash. And they seemed to get the reaction they wanted Tuesday morning, instantaneously driving down key short-term rates that had spiked, threatening to muck up everything from Treasury bond trading to lending to companies and consumers.But the move didn\u2019t last long.By the end of the trading session, rates were grinding back up, prompting Fed officials to fire off a second missive late in the day: They would be back Wednesday morning to offer another $75 billion of cash.With files from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Shopify expands its cannabis e-commerce platform into U.S. CBD market", "description": "Shopify will offer online store design, payment, shipping and marketing in more than 40 states to merchants of hemp-derived cannabidiol", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/shopify-already-in-canadian-pot-starts-u-s-cbd-platform", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hemp-plant.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 17, 2019 9:20 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc. is introducing new features for U.S. retailers of hemp and CBD, expanding its cannabis e-commerce platform south of the border.The Ottawa-based company plans to offer tools including online store design, payment, shipping and marketing in more than 40 states to merchants of hemp-derived cannabidiol, which was legalized in December and is found in everything from skin creams to snacks.\u201cWe aren\u2019t really getting into the CBD business, CBD is getting into the retail business,\u201d Loren Padelford, vice president and general manager of Shopify Plus, said in a phone interview ahead of the announcement. \nShopify boosts delivery network plans with US$450M deal for U.S. robotics company\nAs traditional retail markets flail, the digital economy shrugs off global instability\nhttps://business.financialpost.com/technology/inside-amazon-and-shopifys-race-to-master-time-and-space\nShopify\u2019s platform is already widely used for online sales of recreational cannabis in Canada, where the drug was legalized 11 months ago.

The result sent its shares down the most since December.It\u2019s further confirmation that investors are getting fed up with money-losing pot companies. Weaker-than-expected quarterly results from some of the biggest names in cannabis have contributed to the recent slump in stocks, with the BI Global Cannabis Competitive Peers index down about 40 per cent from its 2019 high on March 21. \nAurora Cannabis sales volume nearly doubles as net revenue jumps 52 per cent\nBMO no longer allowing cannabis stocks to be shorted, retail investors say\nShort sellers set their sights on Canopy Growth, cut Aphria positions\nThe decline has been lucrative for one group, at least: short sellers. Positions in the 20 most-shorted pot stocks have made US$1.17 billion so far in the third quarter, according to an analysis by S3 Partners. That\u2019s a dramatic turnaround from the first quarter, when they posted US$1.78 billion in mark-to-market losses as share prices rose.Total short interest in the sector is up US$2.2 billion or 79 per cent so far in 2019. S3 pointed to Aurora as one of the top candidates for a short squeeze if the stock begins to rally.Beta SpikeNegative earnings aside, a rally may already be underway. The health-care sector is the best performer on Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite Index in September, with pot companies \u2014 including Aurora \u2014 making up four of the top five stocks on the health-care gauge.This is likely to continue as long as the underlying market keeps moving higher, according to a recent analysis by Eight Capital. Technical analyst Tina Normann found that the beta of cannabis stocks has recently spiked to around 2.0 from a range of 1.4 to 1.6, meaning they\u2019re likely to post outsized moves in whatever direction the market is heading.\u201cAs such, greater stability in the overall equity market, combined with sector-specific catalysts across the Canadian, U.S. and CBD markets, offer the potential for the cannabis sector to achieve outsized returns relative to other equities for the remainder of the calendar year,\u201d she wrote.External VariablesAurora said last month that it expected to report net revenue of $100 million (US$75 million) to $107 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, and added it \u201ccontinues to track toward positive adjusted Ebitda,\u201d or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That was already a slight climb-down from guidance provided in January, when it said it would achieve \u201csustained positive Ebitda\u201d beginning in the quarter.Instead, Aurora reported revenue of $98.9 million and an adjusted Ebitda loss of $11.7 million. And year-end accounting corrections made the loss look smaller than it actually was, according to GMP analyst Ryan Macdonell, who estimated that it would have been $27 million without the adjustment.Cam Battley declined to predict when Aurora will reach profitability.\n\nAurora Cannabis Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley.\n\nGavin Young/Postmedia files\n\n\u201cCan we say exactly when we expect to make that transition? No, and part of it will depend on some external variables,\u201d Battley said in a phone interview after the company reported results. \u201cThe opening up of retail stores in Canada, Ontario being key there, that\u2019s one of the critical factors, and of course the opening up of international markets.\u201dThe report wasn\u2019t all negative. Quarterly revenue was the largest ever reported for a pot company, and net cannabis revenue of $94.6 million was at the high end of Aurora\u2019s guided range. It also sold 94 per cent more pot than in the previous quarter.\u201cThis is good news for the entire sector. It shows the demand is there across multiple channels,\u201d Battley said. \u201cAny cannabis company in the world would be very glad to deliver this earnings report.\u201dSeveral analysts have pushed out their expectations for when Aurora will reach positive adjusted Ebitda. BMO\u2019s Tamy Chen now expects the company to report an Ebitda loss of $81 million for fiscal 2020, down from an earlier forecast of positive Ebitda of $33 million, while Eight Capital\u2019s Graeme Kreindler doesn\u2019t expect positive Ebitda until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.Chen also expressed concern about Aurora\u2019s liquidity position, saying it will require at least an additional $200 million of capital in fiscal 2020, as well as a refinancing of approximately $200 million of out-of-the-money convertibles that are due in March.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "After stellar September, stock bulls now see choppy markets ahead for Canada", "description": "Things are about to get interesting", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/vindicated-stock-bulls-now-see-choppy-markets-ahead-for-canada?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/tsx-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 16, 2019 9:43 AM EDT", "content": "Canadian stocks have broken out of their summer stupor, handing investors September\u2019s best first half in seven years as they finally reached a record high.Now things are about to get interesting, according to strategists who predicted the rally.The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 0.2 per cent Friday, capping the week at a new peak of 16,682.42 as both the U.S. and China made moves to ease tensions ahead of talks expected in the coming weeks.

CEO Brian Porter has been focusing on the stable Latin American markets of Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru, with a recent acquisition in Chile helping drive growth as the Toronto-based lender retreated from other areas.At smaller competitor Bank of Montreal, which has focused on the U.S. for greater growth under White, the earnings increase at its U.S. retail bank cooled to 1.1 per cent, the smallest expansion since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

Interest rates have reached a permanent low. U.S. stocks have reached a permanent high. FAANG stocks will rule markets for all time. Value investing is dead.During previous bouts, Warren Buffett, America\u2019s patron saint of investing offered his sage \u2014 and inevitably unpopular \u2014 perspective. When the dot-com mania raged in the late 1990s, he famously warned against chasing internet stocks. And during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he implored investors not to give up on U.S. stocks. Of course, neither episode turned out to be different from the innumerable ones that preceded it, at least when it comes to investing.This time, Buffett has been uncharacteristically missing from the chatter, but that doesn\u2019t mean his views are any less clear, or any less worth paying attention to. \nJust what is Warren Buffett getting up to in Europe?\nBill Ackman pays ultimate homage to idol Warren Buffett with $686-million bet on Berkshire Hathaway\nWarren Buffett admits he was an \u2019idiot\u2019 for not buying Amazon earlier as Berkshire acquires stake\nLet\u2019s start with Buffett\u2019s favourite stock market barometer, the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. As its name suggests, it measures the total value of the stock market as a percentage of GDP. In simple terms, a lower ratio is bullish and a higher one is bearish.The ratio was prescient during the last two downturns. It shot up to 146 per cent at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, a record at the time and well above its average of 89 per cent since 1975, according to numbers compiled by the World Bank. It peaked again at 137 per cent just before the financial crisis in 2007. Where is the market cap-to-GDP ratio now? It notched a fresh high of 154 per cent in 2017, according to the latest available number, and is almost certainly higher today given that the U.S. stock market is up roughly 7 per cent since the end of 2017.So it\u2019s probably safe to say that Buffett doesn\u2019t love the lofty level of the stock market. And judging by the record US$122 billion of cash he\u2019s hoarding at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it\u2019s also safe to assume he doesn\u2019t expect the market to remain elevated forever. Buffett\u2019s cash pile is more than half the value of Berkshire\u2019s US$208-billion portfolio of public companies, and since 1987 his cash allocation as a percentage of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio was only higher in the years leading up to the financial crisis.At the same time, the few stocks that do appeal to Buffett suggest his faith in value investing is unshaken despite a miserable decade of underperformance for the strategy. Roughly 45 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s stock portfolio is allocated to the financial sector, and eight of the portfolio\u2019s top 12 holdings are financial stocks \u2014 a deeply contrarian bet. The sector has been hampered for much of the last decade by tighter regulation and low interest rates. While profits have picked up recently, many investors fear that a prolonged period of low rates will keep a lid on profits for the foreseeable future.\n\nWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway attends the annual Berkshire shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2019.\n\nJOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs a result, the financial sector has been one of the cheapest sectors by most measures for years. It\u2019s still the most represented sector in many value indexes, including a 21 per cent allocation in the S&P 500 Value Index and 23 per cent in the Russell 1000 Value Index. That\u2019s apparently not enough for Buffett, whose allocation to the sector is double that.Much has been made of Buffett\u2019s uncharacteristic pivot to technology stocks in recent years, but that, too, is mostly a value play. Apple Inc. makes up nearly 90 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s 27 per cent allocation to the technology sector. When Buffett began buying Apple in early 2016, it was a bona fide value stock. It boasted an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, and an average price-to-cash flow ratio of 7.5 during the first quarter of that year, well below the S&P 500\u2019s P/E ratio of 19.5 and P/CF ratio of 10.9. Apple is pricier today, but it\u2019s still the largest name in the S&P 500 Value Index, with a hefty 8.3 per cent allocation.Buffett has said that he regrets passing on Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. when the companies were younger, but don\u2019t mistake the maestro. The fact that he isn\u2019t loading up on them today, despite having plenty of cash to do so, speaks volumes. Amazon trades at a jaw-dropping P/E ratio of 73 and Alphabet at 27, which is the furthest thing from value. Buffett already has a small 0.5 per cent allocation to Amazon on the recommendation of one of his deputies. Don\u2019t count on him making meaningfully more room for Amazon or Google at current prices.For now, Buffett is paying a price for his dissent.\u00a0 Berkshire\u2019s return trailed the S&P 500 by 0.9 percentage points a year from 2009 to 2018, including dividends. It\u2019s not the first time. Buffett lagged the market by 3.2 percentage points a year around the Nifty Fifty craze from 1971 to 1975 and by 6.1 percentage points a year during the dot-com boom from 1995 to 1999.Still, Berkshire\u2019s portfolio remains unabashedly Buffett: big profits at a reasonable cost. The portfolio has a weighted-average return on capital of 12 per cent, compared with just 7.9 per cent for the S&P 500. And it\u2019s far cheaper. Buffett\u2019s portfolio has a P/E ratio of 16.5, based on 12-month trailing operating earnings per share, compared with 21 for the S&P 500.There\u2019s little indication, in other words, that Buffett is wavering from his long-standing investing principles. It\u2019s a timely example, even if Buffett is no longer eager to say so.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "Trump says China wants to make a trade deal 'very badly,' but Beijing downplays breakthrough", "description": "At the G7, Trump lauded Xi Jinping as a 'great leader' and said 'anything\u2019s possible' when asked if he would delay tariff increases on China", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-says-china-talks-back-on-but-beijing-downplays-breakthrough", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/trump-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 26, 2019 12:41 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said China wants to make a deal as he praised comments by the country\u2019s chief negotiator for trade, offering a more conciliatory tone after escalating tensions in recent days.\u201cThey want to make a deal very badly,\u201d Trump said during a press conference from the Group of Seven meeting in Biarritz, France. \u201cThe tariffs have hit them very hard.\u201dTrump also noted remarks made earlier Monday by China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He. \u201cHe wants to see a deal made, he wants it to be made under calm conditions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe used the word calm, I agree with him.\u201dU.S. stocks added to gains as Trump spoke at the press conference and 10-year Treasury yields held close to a three-year low. \n\u2018The American disease\u2019: Canadian companies pouring cash into stock buybacks as backlash grows abroad\nSelf-interested G7 leaders unlikely to save the world from the next economic crisis\nRecession talk is growing.

Later, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China\u2019s Global Times newspaper, said in a tweet that top trade negotiators hadn\u2019t spoken by phone in recent days and that Trump was exaggerating the significance of the trade contacts.Trump later, at a separate bilateral meeting, insisted that calls were had at the highest level and was not aware that China was disputing them. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, also in Biarritz, said \u201cthere were discussions that went back and forth and let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201dTrump\u2019s comments mark the latest twist in months of negotiations that have seen moments of optimism give way to even greater escalation. While the two sides have at times appeared close to a deal, China has balked at U.S. demands for market-based reforms in areas like state-run enterprises that could jeopardize the Communist Party\u2019s grip on power.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump attends the first working session of the G7 Summit on August 25, 2019 in Biarritz, France.\n\nJeff J Mitchell - Pool /Getty Images\n\nThe developments came after a weekend of tit-for-tat tariffs had rocked financial markets and fuelled fears that the standoff would drag the global economy into recession.Beijing\u2019s retaliation on Friday to an earlier U.S. tariff hike led to yet another increase from Trump, who said that existing 25 per cent tariffs on some US$250 billion in imports from China would rise to 30 per cent come Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Morgan Stanley warned that the spiral of trade measures could result in a global downturn within nine months.Trump on Monday said the two countries were now dealing on \u201cproper terms.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great thing that happened, and they want to get something done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow maybe it won\u2019t get done, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen them where they really do want to make a deal, and I think that\u2019s a very positive step.\u201dChina has consistently agreed to engage in talks even with tariff escalations taking place. A round of negotiations that had been planned for September had not formally been called off after Trump pivoted to further tariff increases even after an apparent detente between the two sides in Shanghai last month.China\u2019s stance now has been referred to as \u201ctalking while fighting,\u201d and officials continue to pledge that they\u2019ll meet Trump\u2019s trade measures with their own response even as they stress readiness to negotiate.China\u2019s retaliatory measures from Friday aim at the heart of Trump\u2019s political support \u2014 factories and farms across the Midwest and South at a time when the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing down.

Yet Canadian personal-and-commercial banking remains the company\u2019s biggest division. The operation posted a 7.9 per cent jump in earnings to a record $1.61 billion, representing almost half of overall profit at the bank. Wealth-management earnings rose 11 per cent to $639 million.The Toronto-based lender saw improvements in two areas of concern for investors and analysts: expenses and provisions. Growth in non-interest expenses cooled after three quarters of accelerated growth as the bank invested in technology and spent more on hiring, marketing and new initiatives. Still, costs reached a record $5.99 billion, up 2.3 per cent from a year earlier.\u201cAs the revenue headwinds might be picking up, given the interest rate outlook, we saw that we needed to slow that rate of growth,\u201d Bolger said. \u201cWe expect to continue to grow expenses, albeit at a much slower rate than what we\u2019ve been growing over the last couple years.\u201dRoyal Bank has been facing elevated levels of provisions and impaired loans this year, notably in its wholesale lending portfolio in areas such as the U.S. oil-and-gas industry. In the third quarter, the bank set aside $425 million, little changed from the previous quarter and up 20 per cent from a year earlier.Royal Bank\u2019s shares were little changed at $99.44 at 9:51 a.m. in Toronto. The stock has risen 6.4 per cent this year, outperforming the 4.4 per cent gain for the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.Separately, Royal Bank said that Doug McGregor, group head of RBC Capital Markets and RBC Investor & Treasury Services, will retire on Jan. 31 after 37 years at the bank. Derek Neldner, global head of investment banking at RBC Capital Markets, will become group head of capital markets effective Nov. 1, while Doug Guzman, who oversees wealth management and insurance, will take over Investor & Treasury Services.Other takeaways from the bank\u2019s quarterly results:The company routinely expands mortgage balances by about 5 per cent each quarter, topping growth at its rivals. Domestic mortgage balances rose 5.9 per cent to $257.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter.Most Canadian banks increase their quarterly dividends twice a year. Royal Bank stuck to that tradition, boosting its payout 2.9 per cent to $1.05.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "All eyes on Big Six Bank earnings after volatile week for markets in Canada", "description": "Royal Bank of Canada kicks off the reporting season on Wednesday and CIBC the following day", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/all-eyes-on-big-six-bank-earnings-after-volatile-week-for-markets-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/rbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 19, 2019 9:03 AM EDT", "content": "Investors will turn their focus to the first two of the Big Six banks to report fiscal third-quarter results after a week that roiled Canada\u2019s equity and bond markets.The nation\u2019s biggest lenders make up about 23 per cent of the S&P/TSX Composite Index and on an average total return basis, the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index has been a laggard compared with Canada\u2019s main stock stock gauge this year \u2014 which has gained about 15 per cent including dividends.\u201cWe are trimming our forecasts for the second time in the last month,\u201d Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault said in an Aug. 14 report, citing weak capital market trends and margin pressure. \nOpen banking review passes milestone, but progress too slow for some\nHSBC, RBC join JPMorgan-backed trading platform cutting out voice broker\nRBC becomes first major bank to predict Bank of England will cut rates this year\nBanks are expected to report on average a 6 per cent increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the prior year, according analysts at firms including Eight Capital and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

He argues lower interest rates, an accelerating housing market, a solid labour market, record high stocks and overall decent investment returns will support consumption.\u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see a pick up in big ticket items again,\u201d Demers said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not great because we\u2019re relying on debt, but in terms of dynamics, it looks more positive over the next 12 to 18 months in an environment where rates are going down, and not up.\u201d \nDelinquency rates climb to two-year high as Canadian credit card balances grow\nCanadians\u2019 insolvency problems might not be as bad as everyone thinks, C.D. Howe says\nWith the Bank of Canada holding interest rates \u2026 just how vulnerable are Canadians to debt?\nHome sales skidded to their lowest since 2012 last year as higher interest rates and tighter lending rules cast a pall over the real estate market. Automobile sales also suffered in Canada, with 2018 marking the first annual drop since the last recession. The malaise has been reflected in the pace of household credit growth, which has slowed to a crawl: It rose just 3.4 per cent in May, the weakest annual pace since 1983.But the Canadian housing market \u2014 east of Manitoba, at least \u2014 is already showing signs of shaking off that weakness. Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show prices through June in the Greater Toronto Area are 3 per cent higher on a six-month average basis, while Ottawa and Montreal have seen even faster gains, up 7.6 per cent and and 6.4 per cent respectively. In addition, the 11.5 per cent increase in resale volumes in the GTA signals \u201cvery strong,\u201d demand, Demers said.\u201cThe soft landing is behind us,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you think about the GTA and Canada in general, we\u2019re looking more at a re-acceleration.\u201dThe high household debt level \u201cremains a big concern and a headwind to the Canadian dollar,\u201d said Demers, and without a strong capital spending boom, the lingering debt burden will mean it\u2019s tough to \u201coutperform trend growth\u201d once rates eventually move higher, constraining disposable income.In the shorter term, however, Demers is more bullish on Canada, partly because the country\u2019s equity market may be less exposed to trade-war uncertainty. He sees car sales stabilizing this summer, and the housing market in central Canada continuing to accelerate. Gross domestic product for May on Wednesday will give an indication of whether the country\u2019s economic upswing remains on track.\u201cThe pace of credit growth should pick up in the second half of this year,\u201d as more \u201ctrend-like\u201d household spending returns, Demers said. \u201cThis removes a lot of the downside risks regarding households we saw earlier this year.\u201dConsumer confidence highest in a year and a half \n \nOne more reason to believe big-ticket spending is set for a rebound is the recent surge in consumer confidence measures, which are closely tied to the state of the economy and moves in stock markets. The Bloomberg Nanos economic mood index reached 59.06 this month, the highest level in a year and a half. Periods of elevated consumer confidence tend to coincide with increases in home and vehicle sales.The fear of missing out is also fuelling the nation\u2019s debt habit.40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they're spending more than they earn \n \nA survey by Manulife Bank of Canada found almost 40 per cent of respondents, mostly millennials, say they\u2019re spending more than they earn, and 12 per cent attribute the imbalance to an excess of costly outings with friends or family.A lot of that has to do with the pressure of social media, according to Rick Lunny, the bank\u2019s chief executive officer, who says especially for younger people who haven\u2019t had time to build savings, the rising cost of housing and child care leaves little to spend on entertainment.\u201cEverybody\u2019s on social media,\u201d Lunny said by phone. \u201cEverybody seems to have a better life than you. So you have this fear of missing out and you only live once attitude, but that\u2019s a very expensive lifestyle when you can\u2019t afford it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Luke Kawa", "title": "Interest rate cuts are no cure-all in a trade war, Bank of Canada's Poloz warns", "description": "Investors may think central banks can prevent a trade war-induced recession by cutting interest rates, but it's never that simple, Poloz says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/rate-cuts-are-no-panacea-in-a-trade-war-warns-bank-of-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/poloz-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "July 11, 2019 10:03 AM EDT", "content": "Investors may think central banks can prevent a trade war-induced recession by cutting interest rates, but it\u2019s never that simple, says Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.Responding to a reporter\u2019s question about the limits of monetary policy when dealing with trade tensions, Poloz replied it\u2019s not as easy as lowering borrowing costs.\u201cMy sense is that the markets are not really on to the complexity of it,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cIt seems a little too easy that interest rates could decline and that makes everything OK.\u201d \nBank of Canada keeps rate steady, but gives itself room to pivot\n\u2018We see Bank of Canada on hold for next couple of years\u2019: What the economists say about Wednesday\u2019s rate decision\nBank of Canada counts the costs of the biggest threat to our economy right now\nPoloz spoke as U.S. stocks hit a fresh all-time high after Fed Chair Jerome Powell solidified bets for an interest rate reduction at the end of the month, and with global and Canadian shares not far off records.

Its shares have more than doubled this year, making it one of the top-performing health-care stocks on the TSX Venture Exchange.Li\u2019s other healthcare forays include a cancer-drug developer and a company holding the patent for a chemical that purportedly defies aging.

That makes their practices more efficient, meaning better outcomes and shorter waits for patients, he says. Doctors can join Well Health\u2019s growing chain of clinics under a revenue-sharing agreement or simply pay for the services of the company\u2019s medical electronic records software.There\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. Canada\u2019s primary-care doctors, who can see as many as 50 patients a day, have been sluggish to adopt the most basic technologies. Walls of paper folders are still the norm, online patient portals are almost unheard of, and people still while away hours in waiting rooms.Canada scored the worst out of 11 high-income nations in terms of wait times for emergency-room care, specialists and elective surgery in a 2017 study by the Commonwealth Fund. Compared to universal healthcare systems in other developed economies, Canada is one of the most expensive, with modest to poor performance \u2014 in part due to its lower-than-average adoption of medical technologies, according to the Fraser Institute.We're one of the most broadband-connected countries in the world \u2014 it seems totally counterintuitive that we lack any kind of digitization in primary careHamed Shahbazi, CEO and founder, Well Health \n \n\u201cWhich industry do you know still operates like it did 40 years ago?,\u201d asks Shahbazi. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the most broadband-connected countries in the world \u2014 it seems totally counterintuitive that we lack any kind of digitization in primary care.\u201dIt\u2019s a lucrative market: Canada is estimated to have spent $254 billion, or $6,839 per person, in 2018 on healthcare, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information. It\u2019s also \u201can attractive, recession-resilient business,\u201d says Gabriel Leung, a Toronto-based analyst at Beacon Securities Ltd.Well Health is now Canada\u2019s third-largest provider of electronic medical records following a string of acquisitions, servicing more than 850 clinics, according to Daniel Rosenberg, an analyst at Haywood Securities Inc., who believes the company\u2019s shares are undervalued.

Well Health, he believes, has \u201cmany, many-fold greater potential,\u201d largely because the field is wide open: the country\u2019s largest chain of health-care clinics has only 34 offices, he says.He says he captured the interest of Li thanks to an acquaintance with a long-time confidante of the billionaire, Solina Chau.\n\nWell Health offers software tools that doctors couldn\u2019t otherwise afford as standalone clinics, helping make their practices more efficient, meaning better outcomes and shorter waits for patients.\n\nGetty Images\n\nChau runs Horizon Ventures, Li\u2019s prodigious venture capital arm that was an early backer of Facebook Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Siri and is the primary channel of investment for the billionaire\u2019s wealth. In the past 14 months, Horizon Ventures has participated in at least two rounds of funding in Well Health, while Li bought $500,000 in convertible bonds through a holding company in June, according to company filings.Li owned 11 per cent of outstanding shares, making him the second-biggest investor after Shahbazi, according to a May filing.

Bonds continue to rally, with the 10-year once again falling below two per cent \u2014 the bearish yin to equities\u2019 yang. There\u2019s more, too.\u201cWe have this weird combination of U.S. stocks at all-time highs, very low forward interest rates, and we see signs of bubbles kind of popping out in all different places,\u201d said Connor Browne, portfolio manager for New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management. \u201cThere are lots of reasons to be worried. Something has to give and there\u2019s some chance that it\u2019s stocks.\u201d \nDashboard of a downturn: These ten global recession signals have started flashing brighter\nThree reasons Canadians will feel the pain of the next recession more than Americans\nFed sits on its hands while analysts sit on U.S. \u2018recession watch\u2019\nFrom consumer confidence, to earnings and jobless claims, below are some of the things chart watchers say might have seen their peak.Fading confidenceWrinkles are starting to show in the faces of consumers. Conference Board data showed sentiment fell in June to the lowest since 2017 on Tuesday. At the same time, survey respondents turned bearish on U.S. stocks at one of the fastest paces since the global financial crisis. The deterioration marks a swift turn from similar data in May that marked the best sentiment in 15 years.To Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield Asset Management LLC, there\u2019s reason to believe consumer confidence peaked back in October 2018. That \u201crepresents a warning for the overall investment cycle given that confidence measures historically peak fairly close to the overall bull market,\u201d he wrote in an email.Slowing earnings growthIt\u2019s one of Wall Street\u2019s big dramas. Did earnings growth peak as effects from President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul sunk in? Companies in the S&P 500 posted three straight quarters of 25 per cent profit growth last year. This year, analysts expect earnings for the benchmark to come in at US$166.20 a share. Sure, that\u2019s still a gain of four per cent from last year, but down from the near-eight-per-cent increase that was expected in January.It remains true that peak earnings growth doesn\u2019t necessarily spell the end of the stock market cycle. Richard Bernstein Advisors research has shown that since 1980, earnings growth has peaked 11 times, and in the years following 10 of those periods, S&P 500 returns were positive.Still, the direction of earnings is closely intertwined with stock market returns. In 2000, S&P 500 profit growth topped out in the same quarter that marked highs for the index. When the benchmark rolled over in 2007, earnings gains had been waning for three quarters. Profits may not be doomed to fall this year, but they\u2019re likely not going to get much better, either.Jobless claims bottom?It\u2019s looking possible jobless claims hit a trough for the current economic cycle. In April, weekly claims dropped to 192,000, the lowest number since 1969, and the count has been higher ever since. Estimates for Thursday\u2019s release call for 220,000, above the last reading.If the pattern continues, investors should take note. Jobless claims and the S&P 500 have moved inversely since the turn of the century, with bottoms in the data coinciding with peaks for stocks. Andrew Zatlin of SouthBay Research Inc., the top Bloomberg-ranked jobless claims forecaster, sees \u201cpre-recessionary signals\u201d in the data.\u201cWhen Initial Claims are the same as the prior year, it\u2019s a sign that businesses have stopped growing,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIn the year to date (24 weeks), most weeks have been at or above the prior year\u2019s nominal levels.\u201dMovement of goodsStrategists at Morgan Stanley often cite a more unconventional index as a sign off worry \u2014 the Cass Freight Index, which in essence measures the flow of goods through shipments. The gauge recently fell 6.5 per cent year-over-year and now stands at a \u201ccritical level,\u201d according to the firm. If it slips any further, the index may be signalling a recession, strategists led by Mike Wilson warned.In the most recent report, Cass Freight said \u201cWe see the shipments index as going from \u2018warning of a potential slowdown\u2019 to \u2018signaling an economic contraction.\u201d\u2018Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jenny Leonard, Shawn Donnan and Haze Fan", "title": "U.S. set to delay more China tariffs ahead of Trump-Xi meeting", "description": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed optimism that a deal could be reached by year end", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-set-to-delay-more-china-tariffs-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/china-imports.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 26, 2019 7:46 AM EDT", "content": "The U.S. is willing to suspend the next round of tariffs on an additional US$300 billion of Chinese imports while Beijing and Washington prepare to resume trade negotiations, people familiar with the plans said.The decision, which is still under consideration, may be announced after a meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping set for Saturday at a Group of 20 summit in Japan.

The Trump administration has said the goal of the meeting is to create a path forward for a trade agreement, after negotiations broke down last month.Although each side still wants to secure significant concessions from the other, both agreed to dial down the tit-for-tat responses and aim for a truce that could soothe financial markets while their sides resume negotiations, people familiar with the situation said. It\u2019s not clear if they would set a definite timetable for the tariff cease-fire.The U.S. is prepared to delay the new tariffs for the moment because Beijing wouldn\u2019t have agreed to the meeting otherwise, according to people familiar with the matter.China is willing to make minor compromises including removing the threat of restricting rare-earth exports to the U.S., people familiar with the matter said.The talks between the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies mark a critical juncture in their nearly year-old trade war, and both sides have plenty to lose if it escalates. Trump is riding a strong economy and booming stock market into his re-election campaign. China\u2019s economy has been slowing, and U.S. tariffs are encouraging some foreign companies to shift production or plan investment elsewhere to avoid the higher costs.People familiar with the talks say some advisers are pushing Trump to avoid setting a hard deadline at the G20, to avoid a situation similar to when the two leaders met in December and agreed to a 90-day tariff pause. Lighthizer and other advisers, at that point, said it was a fixed tariff-suspension period to allow time for more talks, but the deadline was repeatedly extended. When those negotiations broke down last month, Trump followed through on this threat to raise tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 per cent from 10 per cent.The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the trade chiefs exchanged views on trade and economic issues during their phone call Monday.

Global trade jitters have strengthened the U.S. dollar at the expense of the Mexican and Canadian currencies, significantly reducing Agnico\u2019s costs, he said.In the hour-long interview, Boyd discussed a wide range of issues, from consolidation in the gold industry to the succession plan for a company he has helmed for more than 20 years.Growth OpportunitiesDespite two mega-mergers in the gold space in the past year, Boyd has no interest in large M&A and believes most consolidation will happen between companies with market values of $1 billion to $3 billion. He\u2019s not worried about any of the world\u2019s giants making a run at Agnico and says he doesn\u2019t waste time looking over his shoulder. Instead, he plans to focus on running his existing portfolio while looking for small acquisitions in safe jurisdictions.Gold\u2019s GainsGold equities, which have underperformed spot gold prices in the past year, are on the verge of a breakout, Boyd says. That\u2019s one point he\u2019s been making while actively wooing high-wealth European generalist investors recently, meeting one day over lunch in Vienna and dinner in Monaco. The current rally in gold prices isn\u2019t about tariffs, he says, but rather the buildup of a number of factors, including a \u201ctired\u201d stock market, \u201cwobbly\u201d economic growth, and rising sovereign debt levels around the world.Resistance has been strong at US$1,360-$US1,370 an ounce of gold; Boyd believes it will take a cut in U.S. interest rates to propel the market above that level. \u201cGold came out of the chute in early 2016 and investors showed up again and the equities took off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could be at that point now.\u201dMoney to SpendWith cash flow set to ramp up, Agnico will be able to continue its 36-year streak of dividends, but the company will also take a look at its balance sheet, Boyd said. \u201cWe have debt maturing so we\u2019ll pay that as we come due.\u201dThe next major tranche \u2014 about $360 million \u2014 at roughly 6.6 per cent interest is due in April 2020, he said. \u201cIt would be nice to reduce that because we could go to the market today and get 4.5 per cent, for 10- to 15-year money.\u201d\n\nDrilling at the Pinos Altos mine in Chihuahua, northern Mexico.\n\nCourtesy Agnico-Eagle\n\nSuccession PlanIn a high-risk sector characterized by ups and downs, Boyd stands out for his longevity.

Are human managers about to be replaced?\nDavid Rosenberg: How weak economic growth is actually fuelling this bull market\u2019s rise\nTechnology stocks have been indispensable to the equity market\u2019s longest bull run ever. The sector is up more than 500 per cent since the 2009 bottom, and the group of six companies often associated with acronyms FAANG or FAAMG have accounted for roughly one fifth of the S&P 500\u2019s rally. Now the market darlings have been hit with a one-two punch in the arenas of trade and regulation, throwing their role as market leaders into doubt.Semiconductor companies and tech hardware firms get a significant amount of their sales from China, pinpointing them as ground zero in the U.S.-China trade war. Plus, the move from the Trump administration to blacklist Huawei Technologies Co. has strategists across Wall Street describing the current environment as a tech war. Add in U.S. antitrust probes hovering over some of the tech mega-caps, and it\u2019s a recipe for trouble.We don't expect there to be a recession, but we think there is a slowdown aheadPrincipal Global Investors' Seema Shah \n \n\u201cYou have to be very, very brave to call the top for the tech sector,\u201d said Shah, a senior global investment strategist. \u201cThe great times for technology are probably behind us now.\u201dThe S&P 500 technology sector fell 8.9 per cent in May, its worst month since 2008. While the group was up 0.9 per cent as of 11:55 a.m. in New York Wednesday, tech stocks are still roughly seven per cent from a record high set in April. So far this week, Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have both fallen more than five per cent in the face of regulatory concerns. While neither company actually classifies as an S&P 500 tech company, they\u2019re often associated with the club.Not that there\u2019s a blanket of doom and gloom over the entire sector. Some pockets, like software security companies, tend to be more stable and could continue to provide healthy returns, according to Shah. But overall, Principal Global Investors is advising clients to shift their equity holdings to a more defensive posture.Within sectors, Shah recommends utilities or real estate. Since the start of May, the two classic bond proxies are the only S&P 500 sectors in the green. Globally, she prefers U.S. stocks over emerging markets. While the American benchmark fell 6.6 per cent in May, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped 7.5 per cent. The idea is to keep risk exposure, but up the onus on quality just in case the bad news falls away, she said.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect there to be a recession, but we think there is a slowdown ahead,\u201d said Shah. \u201cThe best way to do it is you need to stay in risk, but be more defensively positioned for that slowdown.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ksenia Galouchko", "title": "Manulife, which oversees $837 billion in investments, sees turning point at hand for stock pariahs", "description": "Manulife Investment Management is on the cusp of turning overweight on European stocks after buying the dip in May", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investor-with-837-billion-sees-turning-point-for-stock-pariahs", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2019 9:45 AM EDT", "content": "This year\u2019s least-loved stock market has now become so despised that at least one investor says it may be time to turn contrarian.Manulife Investment Management, which oversees US$837 billion, is on the cusp of turning overweight on European stocks after buying the dip in May, according to its global head of asset allocation, Nathan Thooft.

That brought the drop for the month to 6.6 per cent, making it the worst May for the market since 2010 and the third worst if you go all the way back to early 1950s. And that\u2019s saying a lot. May is, after all, according to the traders\u2019 adage, the month where investors are supposed to go, and stay, away.\u00a0In the larger picture of the market of the Trump presidency, though, May\u2019s drop doesn\u2019t actually look so bad. Stock prices, as measured by the broad S&P 500 market index, are still up 27 per cent, including nearly 10 per cent in the first five months of this year. In fact, the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 1.3 per cent on Friday seemed kind of small in the wake of Trump\u2019s demand that Mexico curb immigration or face 25 per cent tariffs and China\u2019s threat that it could essentially ban some U.S. companies from doing any business there. That\u2019s led some to point to the market and make the case that a trade war with China and Mexico won\u2019t be so bad. \nMorgan Stanley sees recession within year if trade war gets any worse\nKevin Carmichael: Trump and trade wars loom over sunny economic outlook\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s Mexico tariffs would impact the U.S. economy\nBut that conclusion is short-sighted. The correct way to gauge how much economic damage the stock market thinks a trade war could inflict is to go back not a month but to when Trump really started talking tough on tariffs, first on steel and other metals, and then on China, in late January 2018. At that time, the Russell 3000, which captures more of the stock market than the S&P 500, was trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 19.3 based on the next 12 months of earnings. At that point, analysts hadn\u2019t fully factored into their estimates the corporate tax cut that had passed the month before. But by May, expected earnings for the Russell 3000 for 2019 had risen to nearly US$103 a share. Based on those expected earnings, and if the index had maintained its pre-trade war fears multiple, the Russell 3000 would be at 1,986, with a market cap for all the stocks in the index of US$36.2 trillion.But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, earnings estimates for the next 12 months have come down to US$98 a share, and the multiple has slumped to 16.6, giving the Russell \u2014 which is at 1,619 \u2014 a market capitalization of US$29.5 trillion. It is impossible to know if that nearly US$7 trillion difference can be attributed entirely to the trade war, and more than likely it cannot. Earnings estimates might have slumped anyway. Earlier this year, it looked as if interest rates were going to rise, which was also weighing on the stock market. Interest rates have instead dropped. And while the global economy has slowed, that could be trade-related as well. Bankim Chadha, the chief U.S. strategist at Deutsche Bank, put his estimate for the damage caused by the trade war at US$5 trillion.The market could also be overstating the potential damage from a trade war. The U.S. imports US$550 billion in goods from China. A 25 per cent tariff on those goods would raise prices by US$138 billion. Mexico imports total an additional US$400 billion, and a 25 per cent tariff on those goods, which is how far Trump has said he would go to curb immigration, would equal another US$90 billion, for a total of US$228 billion. That is, of course, only the cost of higher goods to consumers and for only one year. Trade wars have far-reaching effects. But still, that\u2019s a lot less than US$5 trillion or US$7 trillion. Nonetheless, the collective wisdom of investors has a better track record at predicting the future than most economists. And even if the true number is somewhere in between, Trump\u2019s effort to reorient the U.S.\u2019s place in world trade could end up being much more costly than most people think.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Legal hemp opens the door for U.S. cannabis companies to jump ship and list on big stock exchanges", "description": "Expect an exodus of hemp companies from the CSE, which has been the main beneficiary of TMX's policy of not listing U.S. pot companies", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/hemp-opens-door-to-listings-on-big-exchanges-cannabis-weekly", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hemp-plants.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 3, 2019 11:29 AM EDT", "content": "TMX Group Ltd., operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, scored a coup of sorts last week when Boulder, Colorado-based Charlotte\u2019s Web Holdings Inc. said it will delist from the Canadian Securities Exchange and list on the TSX.This marks the first U.S.-based cannabis company to trade on the main Canadian bourse, which has prohibited listings from companies that are breaking the law where they operate.

Quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2019His venting comes as his two recent picks for the Fed, businessman Herman Cain and conservative economist Stephen Moore, have come under fire, with several Republicans indicating Cain may not be able to win confirmation in the Senate.It also comes days after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s criticism, told lawmakers at a Democratic Party retreat that the central bank won\u2019t bend to political pressure, according to two people in the room for the closed-door event.Trump picked Powell as Fed chairman, replacing Janet Yellen, but later indicated that he regretted the decision, and in late 2018 discussed the feasibility of firing him before appearing to decide against it. Trump has criticized the Fed\u2019s rate increases as it tried to gradually move them to a level that neither stymies nor stimulates growth.Expansion ContinuesThe rate hikes have slowed some segments of the economy, such as housing, but overall the U.S. economic expansion continues, along with the lowest unemployment in decades and inflation near the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target.Lately, Trump has urged the Fed to cut rates to turn the economy into a \u201crocket ship,\u201d which White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week would be growth in the 4 to 4.5 per cent range.The Federal Reserve raised rates four times in 2018, but has since paused, saying it will be \u201cpatient\u201d as it assesses the need for any additional changes in the policy rate, now in a target range of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent.U.S. stocks have risen sharply this year after the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot, reversing a late-2018 swoon. The benchmark S&P 500 Index closed Friday at 2,907.41, less than one percent below its record high close from September. U.S. central bankers in March signalled no rate moves in 2019, based on their outlook for solid if unspectacular economic growth with inflation near goal.If Trump was referring to the more narrow Dow Jones Industrial Average, his tweet suggested the index could be over 36,000 points absent the Fed\u2019s moves. The Dow closed on Friday at 26,412.30.Defending the FedPrior to Trump\u2019s tweeting, global policy makers had spent the weekend leaping to the defence of the Fed and other central banks facing pressure from politicians. At talks of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Saturday that he was \u201ccertainly worried about central bank independence\u201d and especially \u201cin the most important jurisdiction in the world.\u201dWhile many politicians want their central banks to juice growth by keeping monetary policy easy, the risk is the political meddling leaves investors worrying about a flare up of inflation and push up market interest rates in response, potentially hurting expansions.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Five years later, the first pot stock is up 2,139 per cent since its market debut", "description": "Canopy Growth is worth nearly US$15 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/five-years-later-the-first-pot-stock-is-up-2139-since-its-debut?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/canopy-growth.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 5, 2019 12:19 PM EDT", "content": "Five years ago Thursday, the first pot stock began trading on the public markets, prompting a few raised eyebrows and many, many bad puns.

Whether customers will be as excited remains to be seen. Ontario residents have been able to buy cannabis legally since Oct. 17 through the government-run Ontario Cannabis Store website, and the black market remains robust due to lower prices and better selection. The illicit market accounted for about 80 per cent of the $5.9 billion (US$4.4 billion) Canadians spent on cannabis in the fourth quarter, according to Statistics Canada.Other cities will be better serviced than Toronto at first. Ottawa, the nation\u2019s capital with a population of nearly 1 million, has three stores ready to open on Monday. Kingston, with a population of about 124,000, will have two.Weak EarningsDespite the limited rollout, the opening of Ontario stores is \u201ca very significant development\u201d for the industry, Peter Aceto, chief executive officer of CannTrust Holdings Inc., said in an interview.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very important part of getting us out of the black market and I definitely do think it\u2019ll have an impact on demand,\u201d he said.Demand, however, wasn\u2019t the problem for CannTrust and competitor Cronos Group Inc., which both posted significant stock declines last week after reporting sales that missed the lowest analyst estimate.Both failed to capture much of Canada\u2019s recreational market in the fourth quarter, with Cronos\u2019s share estimated by analyst Tamy Chen at BMO Capital Markets at 2 per cent and CannTrust\u2019s at 4 per cent. However, both also stressed that revenue should improve over the course of 2019 as new growing capacity comes online.While most of the larger Canadian licensed producers stress that Canada will ultimately be a small piece of a much bigger international opportunity, the direction of their stock price is still very much determined by their performance in the Canadian market. Cronos\u2019s stock fell 9.5 per cent in the two sessions following its earnings, while CannTrust\u2019s shares plunged 19 per cent the day it reported.Pot Stock LeadershipThose declines weren\u2019t enough to remove Cronos or CannTrust from the S&P/TSX Composite Index\u2019s leaderboard. Cannabis stocks made up six of the top 10 performers on the Canadian benchmark in the first quarter. Hexo Corp. led the way with a gain of 87 per cent, followed by Aurora Cannabis Inc., up 78 per cent. Cronos was in fourth place, Aphria Inc. in sixth, Canopy Growth Corp. in seventh and CannTrust in eighth. Those results helped the benchmark post its best first quarter in 19 years.The cannabis sector as a whole ended the weekly slightly lower, with Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Global Cannabis Competitive Peers index falling 1.2 per cent. Mixed messages from south of the border weighed on stocks after New Jersey lawmakers scrapped a planned legalization vote due to a lack of support, while the House Financial Services Committee voted in favour of the SAFE Act, which would permit commercial banks to offer services to cannabis companies that are in compliance with state law.Upcoming Events This WeekOntario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, will open its first bricks-and-mortar pot shops April 1, nearly six months after legalization.Cannabis Conference 2019, presented by Cannabis Business Times and Cannabis Dispensary magazine, will be held in Las Vegas April 1-3.International Cannabis Business Conference Berlin, billed as \u201cthe preeminent European meeting point for the cannabis industry,\u201d runs March 31-April 2.CannaTech hosts a medical cannabis conference in Tel Aviv, April 1-2.iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc. will report fourth-quarter earnings post-market April 1 with an analyst call scheduled for 8:30 a.m. New York time on April 2.The Flowr Corp. reports fourth-quarter results post-market on April 4, with a call scheduled for 5 p.m. Toronto timeBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew Martin, Dinesh Nair and Archana Narayanan", "title": "Saudi Aramco to buy $69 billion Sabic stake in biggest ever Middle East deal", "description": "Aramco plans to invest US$500 billion over the next decade, and much of that will be on refineries and chemical plants", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/aramco-to-buy-69-billion-sabic-stake-in-record-mideast-deal", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/aramco.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 27, 2019 3:03 PM EDT", "content": "Saudi Aramco will buy a majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp. from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund as the world\u2019s biggest oil firm turns its attention to petrochemicals.The deal, first mooted last year, values the Public Investment Fund\u2019s 70 per cent stake at US$69.1 billion, or 123.4 riyals per share, according to a statement.

Singapore barred all 737 Max flight in and out of the city-state, a move that was followed by Australia.Elsewhere in Asia, a South Korean carrier suspended its 737 Max planes, while two airlines in Latin American also halted operations of the plane, which entered service just a few years ago and has become Boeing\u2019s fastest-selling aircraft, with nearly 4,700 orders. Now, the suspensions have put about a third of the 350-strong global fleet out of action. Canadian airlines, Air Canada and WestJet, have stood behind the safety of their 737 Max planes. \nBoeing shares, vanguard of the Dow, crushed after second 737 MAX crash\n\u2018Performed excellently\u2019: Air Canada, WestJet stand behind safety of Boeing 737 Max 8\nIn a sign that the tragedy in Ethiopia, which killed everyone on board, threatens to become a commercial fiasco for Boeing, launch customer Lion Air is said to be considering a complete switch to Airbus SE planes, a person familiar with the discussions said, with the carrier suspending further 737 Max deliveries this year.The fallout from the crash has weighed on Boeing\u2019s stock, which fell 5.1 per cent to US$379.44 in early trading on Tuesday, adding to a 5 per cent decline on Monday.Since the Ethiopia crash, at least seven of the 24 analysts covering the stock have reviewed their ratings, with two downgrades and one price target cut so far, according to Refinitiv data.DZ Bank became the first brokerage in nearly two years to place a \u201csell\u201d rating on the stock, while setting a price target of US$333 \u2013 the lowest on Wall Street.The zero-risk approach by airlines and aviation authorities in South America and Asia contrasts with assurance by U.S. regulators that the aircraft remains airworthy. The crash has spooked airlines and passengers and eroded faith in the widely flown jetliner because the disaster in Ethiopia bore similarities to the first crash of a 737 Max just five months ago. In both cases, the aircraft crashed minutes after takeoff as the pilots failed to maintain control.While the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders have been recovered from the crash site, little is know at this point about the final fateful moments of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which was en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi in Kenya with 157 on board. Africa\u2019s largest carrier took delivery of its first 737 Max at the end of June as part of an upgrade of its fleet, which also includes Boeing\u2019s twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner and the larger 777 model.The bans in Singapore and Australia mean that the newest version of Boeing\u2019s best-selling model is now blocked from a key long-distance travel destination as well as Changi, Asia\u2019s second-busiest international airport and a popular transit hub. Singapore\u2019s aviation regulator will \u201cgather more information and review the safety risk associated with the continued operation of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft into and out of Singapore,\u201d according to a statement.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration came out on Monday in support of the aircraft, saying the plane remains safe to fly, and that there isn\u2019t conclusive evidence so far to link the loss of the Ethiopian 737 Max 8 on Sunday and the fatal Lion Air disaster. The planemaker echoed the FAA\u2019s statement, saying it stood by the aircraft, a revamped version of its workhorse single-aisle jet. Airbus competes in this lucrative segment of the market with its family of A320neo models.\u201cSpeculating about the cause of the accident or discussing it without all the necessary facts is not appropriate and could compromise the integrity of the investigation,\u201d Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a message to employees.Boeing said late Monday that in the coming weeks it plans to roll out software improvements for the anti-stall function that contributed to the Indonesian disaster.China was the first aviation market to move on the 737 Max following the crash, with the regulator grounded all 96 of China\u2019s 737 Max planes early Monday until their safety can be assured. But the moves by Singapore and Australia go a step further than those of China and Indonesia, where domestic Max 737 fleets were grounded but the planes not barred from the countries\u2019 airspace.Singapore\u2019s suspension includes both the Max 8 and 9 variants and affects foreign carriers that deploy the aircraft for flights into the island-city. The 737 Max is the newest version of Boeing\u2019s most important aircraft type, a narrow-body jet forms the backbone of many global airline fleets.Airbus was first to introduce an upgraded variant of the A320 family with new engines that are more fuel efficient, and the model became a huge commercial hit for the Toulouse, France-based company, prompting Boeing to follow suit with a revamped 737.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "Crescent Point writes down value of assets by $2.7 billion amid volatile oil prices", "description": "Crescent Point looking to sell some conventional holdings in Saskatchewan and some infrastructure assets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/crescent-point-takes-2-billion-writedown-amid-oil-swings", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/0503crescentpoint.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 7, 2019 10:35 AM EST", "content": "Crescent Point Energy Corp., a Canadian oil producer focused on Saskatchewan, wrote down the value of its assets by $2.73 billion to account for higher financing costs amid volatile crude prices.The after-tax writedown reflects the fair value of the company\u2019s asset base \u201cin the current commodity price and macro-economic environment,\u201d Calgary-based Crescent Point said Thursday in an investor presentation.

Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country\u2019s second and fifth largest banks, bolstered provisions in the last fiscal quarter, citing a rise in corporate arrears among the reasons.Canadian companies\u2019 interest expenses almost doubled this decade to $10.8 billion (US$8.1 billion) at the end of the year from $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to government data. While interest revenues that companies get from their interest bearing investments were at $18.7 billion in the last quarter of 2018, the rate of interest expenses jumped three times faster than revenue from interest bearing investments.Credit to Canadian businesses rose in the last 12 months through January by 6.1 per cent to $2.18 trillion, while lending to households expanded 3.1 per cent and reached $2.16 trillion, according to Bank of Canada data. Lenders are expanding credit to companies even as the country\u2019s economic growth almost stalled in the last quarter of 2018 as consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing investment fell by the most in a decade, business spending dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.Business Ramp UpInfor is getting ready \u2014 it\u2019s hired veteran restructuring expert Paul Liebovitz, who is already advising publicly listed companies in the renegotiation of their debt facilities, Selfe said, declining to provide the name of the firm. Infor is also turning to pension funds and insurance companies to fund debtor-in-possession loans, a type of credit for distressed companies, said Selfe.\u201cThere were very few, if any DIP providers in Canada\u201d said Selfe. \u201cThis is one of the areas that we think is a ripe opportunity.\u201dWhile companies in the mining and oil & gas sectors have been in a downturn for several years, the restructurings could be expanded into some of the suppliers of those industries as well as services firms, said Selfe. Also, some \u2018veteran\u2019 services industries, or manufactured or sport or niche manufacturing industries, may also being forced to reorganize their balance sheet.\n\nInfor Financial Group founding partner Neil Selfe.\n\nNational Post files\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often very, very little left if they hit the wall.

For that to happen there should be a closing of the current gap between the values that \u201csmall players think they\u2019re worth and what the larger players are now willing to pick them up,\u201d he said.\u201cWe do think there\u2019s a few mid tier players that will still pick-up Canadian assets and we\u2019ll try to push into that top ten,\u201d said Selfe.

That\u2019s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years, down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase.While a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices, it\u2019s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector. Consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years, housing fell by the most in a decade, business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter, and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015.The only thing that kept the nation\u2019s economy from contracting was a build-up in inventories as companies stockpiled goods.At the very least, the numbers suggest that heightened uncertainty \u2014 everything from the impact of higher interest rates to potential trade wars and oil-sector woes \u2014 has made a real impact on both consumer and business sentiment. The question now is what the weaker-than-expected data suggests about the economy\u2019s ability to rebound back to more normal growth levels. \nOops, Statistics Canada appears to have released today\u2019s key economic data almost half an hour early\nCanada\u2019s big banks feel the pain from the stock market\u2019s swoon\nOur debt-clogged world is just one shock away from tipping into recession\nWhat Canadians need to see in the Federal budget: David Rosenberg\nMost economists had been expecting the soft patch would come to an end by this spring and growth would accelerate closer to 2 per cent for the rest of the year. No one, however, expected the economy would need to come back from such a low point. The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest forecast, from January, is for annualized growth of 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, before the expansion accelerates back to above 2 per cent growth by next year.Until recently, the economy had been doing relatively well even in the face of higher rates. It grew by a Group-of-Seven-best 3 per cent in 2017, and expanded at a healthy clip in the first half of last year \u2014 prompting the Bank of Canada to press ahead with higher borrowing costs.But even that strength had been overstated, with Statistics Canada revising down its estimates for first half growth to 2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. For all of 2018, the economy grew by 1.8 per cent \u2014 below the Bank of Canada\u2019s estimate for 2 per cent. Monthly data released Friday show the economy ended the year contracting, with December gross domestic product down 0.1 per cent.\u00a0The data suggest rising interest rates may be having a bigger impact on consumers than expected. Consumption slowed to an annualized 0.7 per cent pace in the four quarter, the weakest growth since the start of 2015 as households increased their savings.Business investment also disappointed, with non-residential capital spending down an annualized 10.9 per cent \u2014 the third straight quarterly decline and the second consecutive drop of more than 10 per cent. Residential investment also contracted for a second straight quarter, down an annualized 14.7 per cent, the biggest drop since 2009.The economy also wasn\u2019t able to get a contribution from exporters who have helped lift growth over the past year.Exports recorded an annualized 0.2 per cent drop in the fourth quarter. Imports also declined, down 1.1 per cent.The biggest contributor to growth came from inventories \u2014 driven by machinery, food and wood producers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte, Kristine Owram and Paula Sambo", "title": "Goldman Sachs alumnus readies $100-million war chest to jump into cannabis debt financing", "description": "Trichome Financial, led by Michael Ruscetta, will only lend to Canadian firms at first but wants to develop a structure that will allow it to lend elsewhere", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/goldman-alumnus-jumps-into-cannabis-debt-financing", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cannabis-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 20, 2019 12:21 PM EST", "content": "Trichome Financial Corp., a company led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumnus Michael Ruscetta, is readying a $100 million (US$75 million) war chest to dive into the business of debt financing for cannabis companies.Toronto-based Trichome is planning to raise between $25 million (US$18.8 million) and $35 million of new equity, adding to $15 million already raised by partners, managers and some investors, Ruscetta said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s offices in Toronto.

When it comes to investing, everyone needs some stocks in their portfolios, they just have to be \u201cmore cautious,\u201d Sherman said during the panel discussion.\u201cYou have peak earnings and peak euphoria,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe question becomes, how does corporate America respond at this stage? It doesn\u2019t look horrible.\u201dShiller and DoubleLine have a long relationship. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund puts the majority of its investments into a fixed-income portfolio, while at the same time employing derivatives to gain exposure to large-cap equities that are undervalued based on an index created by Shiller. Launched in 2013, the fund\u2019s five-year track record puts the product in the 99th percentile when compared with peers, according to a Bloomberg ranking.The cyclically adjusted P-E ratio (CAPE), which Shiller developed 30 years ago, uses 10 years of earnings in its calculations to gauge stock market valuations. Right now the measure comes in around 30, which is \u201cquite high\u201d according to Shiller, especially considering that\u2019s about double the historical average. Going forward, though, the ratio should come down just because of time \u2014 the worst earnings during the financial crisis should fall out of the equation soon.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you expect negative returns,\u201d Shiller said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage growth, the bread and butter of Canadian banks, has shrunk to 17-year low", "description": "Investors urged to \u2018recalibrate\u2019 their expectations to what is arguably one of the most important trends in the industry in years", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/mortgage-growth-at-17-year-low-puts-canadian-banks-on-notice", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/mortgage.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 5, 2019 10:57 AM EST", "content": "Mortgage growth has shrunk to a 17-year low in Canada, increasing pressure on the country\u2019s big banks to find business elsewhere.Residential mortgage growth rose 3.1 per cent to $1.55 trillion in December from a year earlier, the slowest pace since May 2001, and half the growth rate from two years ago, according to data from the Bank of Canada.\u201cThe bread-and-butter of profitability for Canadian banks \u2014 is going to have a little less butter on the bread,\u201d said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co., whose firm oversees $30.8 billion in Canada. \u201cThat is, in many cases, the largest and most profitable and steady of the businesses that these banks operate.\u201d \nThe year higher borrowing costs and stricter mortgage rules hit home\nShort sellers renew bets against Canadian banks in 2019 \u2014 so far they\u2019re paying a high price\nToronto new home sales plunge to lowest in almost 20 years as unsold condos pile up\nWhy the government should rethink the mortgage stress test\nInvestors will need to \u201crecalibrate\u201d their expectations in what is arguably one of the most important trends in the industry in years, Fehr said in a phone interview. \u201cThe banks that will do best are the ones that do have other levers to pull.\u201d\u2018Government efforts to rein in household debt, including tougher mortgage-qualifying standards, have dramatically cooled the housing market in the past year. Toronto and Vancouver posted their worst year for sales in at least a decade last year. Vancouver\u2019s market waned further in January as average prices tumbled 9.1 per cent over the past 12 months.Short Sales\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s just spontaneously happening: This is an engineered slowdown with the banks being willing participants in some of these changes that have been made,\u201d CIBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Sedran said in an interview. \u201cIt makes for a healthier lending environment and a healthier housing environment for the longer term.\u201dAn overinflated housing market and high debt are among the reasons cited by some U.S. hedge funds and short-sellers over the years who have bet against the Canadian banks. On average, about 2.4 per cent of shares of the six biggest Canadian banks is held in short-interest positions as of the end of January, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.Vindication for those shorts appears some way off for now. The eight-member S&P/TSX Commercial Banks index has tread water for about two years. It gained about 3.3 per cent compared with a 0.8 per cent increase in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and a 4.4 per cent gain in the U.S. KBW Bank Index.Canadian bank executives have already been conveying their expectations for slower growth this year.Wealth ManagementToronto-Dominion Bank\u2019s Teri Currie, who oversees the domestic banking division at Canada\u2019s largest bank by assets, expects \u201cmid-single digit\u201d growth this year in residential secured lending, which includes amortizing home-equity credit lines and mortgages.\u201cIn today\u2019s context it\u2019s sending a strong statement that the investments that we\u2019ve made are going to pay off in relatively good growth,\u201d she said in a Jan. 22 interview.Executives at rival banks are expecting domestic mortgage growth to be in the low to mid-single digits in 2019, when the country\u2019s economic expansion is expected to slow to 1.9 per cent.Investor David Baskin, whose Baskin Wealth Management oversees $1.2 billion, said he\u2019d rather banks focus on wealth management. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for the banks to grow their mortgage business,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the juice is.\u201dBusiness LendingSteve Belisle, a Montreal-based portfolio manager with Manulife Asset Management who helps oversee about $7.5 billion, said the banks are countering the slowdown in residential lending with growth in business loans \u2014 something that makes Belisle a bit uneasy. Canada\u2019s six biggest banks had an 11 per cent jump in commercial lending last year.\u201cThe overall loan growth for the banks is actually steady \u2014 it has been around 4.5 per cent \u2014 and that\u2019s because they are offsetting the slowdown in mortgages with commercial lending, which is low double digits,\u201d Belisle said. \u201cThat\u2019s adding risk at the peak of the economic cycle.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matt Townsend", "title": "'Just get it fixed': Big business plans all-out blitz on Washington to end Trump's trade war", "description": "The campaign includes an ad aimed at parents that essentially says the trade war might be endangering babies", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/big-business-plans-all-out-blitz-on-washington-to-end-trade-war", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/donald-trump-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 31, 2019 11:22 AM EST", "content": "Corporate America is taking the gloves off in its campaign to end President Trump\u2019s trade war.A coalition of more than 200 trade associations spanning agriculture, manufacturing, retail, technology, oil and even liquor will begin a new two-pronged attack next week to try to end the policies they see as damaging. The campaign, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, will involve blanketing Capitol Hill with farmers and other business owners, plus debuting an ad aimed at parents that essentially says the trade war might be endangering babies.The escalation comes at a crucial time: The president and Chinese officials are meeting this week with just a month to go before U.S. tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese imports are slated to more than double to 25 per cent. It also marks a shift in strategy. After a year of struggling to directly sway Trump and his inner circle, including running ads on Fox News \u2014 his favourite cable channel \u2014 corporate lobbyists are ratcheting up pressure outside the White House.\u201cPeople have to think through different strategies because the normal operating procedure doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Matt Priest, chief executive officer of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, which is part of the wider coalition. \u201cSome of that strategy is paying off, but the response isn\u2019t the response we would\u2019ve liked.\u201d \nU.S. finance chair says steel, aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico should go before new NAFTA passed\nBeijing heads to trade talks with \u2018good faith\u2019 as Trump says China\u2019s weak economy incentive for deal\nAlberta, B.C. say steel safeguards are undermining infrastructure projects\nD.C. BoundNext week, about 100 executives and business owners from companies big and small will visit Washington to lobby Congress, especially the large freshmen class \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 that may still be formulating their stances on trade. Support is also needed for a bipartisan bill intended to rein in the president\u2019s trade authority.The group descending on Washington includes people like Brent Bible, who runs a 5,000-acre corn and soybean farm in Romney, Indiana. Soybeans were hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs last year, pushing down prices to a point where farmers no longer make money. His farm also took a hit when U.S. levies on steel and aluminum made equipment pricier.\u201cJust get it fixed,\u201d said Bible, who holds an economics degree. If this dispute goes on much longer, he said he worries about a \u201csnowball effect\u201d that could make soybeans almost worthless. Bible voted for Trump but said his support has waned in recent months. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a deal soon, then we are looking at a major long-term impact.\u201dThis coalition was formed in September, and its activities so far have included hosting anti-tariff events across the country that generated local media attention and publishing stats on the impact of the trade war. The new push takes that further. It will include a press conference on Feb. 6 with a bipartisan group of senators, including Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Pat Toomey, who crafted the bill to reduce presidential trade powers.Infant PleaThe coalition also had a new ad that tries to tug at the heartstrings of Americans by getting them to feel the pain it says Trump\u2019s trade war is causing. The spot, which will first run online in Washington and swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, features Cribs for Kids, a Pittsburgh-based charity that sells 100,000 low-cost portable baby beds a year to local governments and hospitals. The partners then give them to low-income families, who might not have one otherwise.In the ad, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director, Judy Bannon, says Trump\u2019s tariffs are increasing costs for the cribs it imports from China. The charity has already seen a decline in orders after a 10 per cent levy on Chinese goods last year, Bannon said in an interview. She paints the impact in life-and-death terms, saying that getting babies to sleep in cribs and on their backs \u2014 a message reinforced on the charity\u2019s cribs \u2014 reduces Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\u201cAs a nonprofit, we never thought tariffs would affect us, but they do,\u201d Bannon says in the 30-second video. The spot also tries to drive home the point that tariffs are essentially taxes on U.S. companies, despite Trump\u2019s Twitter proclamations that China is the one paying the duties. \u201cPresident Trump says that China is paying these tariffs, but I see the cost on my invoices.\u201dDespite strong opposition from corporate America and the lobbying infrastructure it bankrolls, thwarting Trump on trade hasn\u2019t been easy. The impact of the tariffs is still small when compared with the overall U.S. economy and hasn\u2019t resulted in widespread price increases for consumers. Several lobbyists noted that the government shutdown ended only when airports were disrupted, and that kind of bellwether event hasn\u2019t materialized yet with tariffs. The administration has done its part by avoiding hitting consumer products directly to blunt public outcry.And because the trade war is promoted by the White House, most of America\u2019s CEOs have remained publicly silent, for fear of getting criticized publicly by Trump or raising the ire of the administration officials overseeing tariff exemptions. That\u2019s a far cry from 2017, when executives complained on TV and in congressional testimony in a successful bid to kill the border-adjustment tax backed by former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.Little VictoriesTo be sure, there have been victories in corporate America. Lobbyists for farmers, seen as a crucial part of Trump\u2019s base, pushed the administration to authorize US$12 billion in relief funds after Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs. Trade groups also got plenty of items taken off the final tariff lists, including car booster seats for kids. They also point to Trump delaying the next tariff hike by two months to March to allow for more negotiations.The timing of this escalated opposition could be helpful. The president just took a hit from the government shutdown. The political calendar has already turned to the 2020 presidential race, and Trump needs a strong economy for his re-election bid. That story is harder to tell with almost daily reports of U.S. companies \u2014 from Apple Inc. to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. \u2014 partly blaming weak results on the trade war.\u201cA lot things are coming to a head,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, another coalition member. With Trump\u2019s re-election bid looming, \u201cdo you think he\u2019s going to risk a stock market fall over a 25 per cent tariff \u2014 at this point? But I don\u2019t know anyone who has been right calling Trump\u2019s moves.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Reade Pickert", "title": "U.S. stocks strengthen on earnings, shutdown deal optimism", "description": "Dow and Nasdaq erase first weekly declines of the year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-stocks-strengthen-on-shutdown-deal-optimism", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/atrump_government_shutdown.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 25, 2019 5:16 PM EST", "content": "Stocks rose as corporate earnings bolstered confidence in the economy and President Donald Trump said U.S. lawmakers agreed to re-open the government on an interim basis.

But for shares of energy companies, it hasn\u2019t been as much of a help.Since the production curtailment was unveiled early last month, Western Canadian Select crude has almost doubled to about $43 a barrel, narrowing its discount to benchmark U.S. oil to an almost decade-low of $6.95 a barrel on Jan. 11. Yet in that same time, the S&P/TSX Energy Index is up less than 4 per cent.Driving the stagnant performance are the forced cuts in output among the larger producers as well as a series of conservative moves by smaller drillers who are less affected by the program. Overall, the industry is dialling back spending and waiting for better days \u2014 a strategy that analysts have lauded as prudent but that investors have found less than compelling. \nNow there\u2019s a way to get Alberta oil to market without pipelines \u2014 and recycle plastic at the same time\nAlberta oil cuts offer lifeline to producers \u2014 and create a bunch of new problems\nShrinking Canadian oil discount may start widening again as glut persists\n\u201cCertainly the curtailment program has helped the cash flows, but it\u2019s sending a clear signal: \u2018You can\u2019t grow. Don\u2019t even try,\u2019\u201d said Laura Lau, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto.The larger producers that are most affected by the curtailment, such as Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and Cenovus Energy Inc., are all planning on flat or reduced spending next year.Smaller drillers who aren\u2019t forced to cut as much output are following suit. Whitecap Resources Inc. said last month that it\u2019s keeping spending in line with last year\u2019s levels and heavily weighting it to the second half. Crescent Point Energy Corp. said last week that it\u2019s slashing its spending by $500 million to about $1.3 billion and trimming its dividend.The frugality has even spread beyond the oil industry to gas producers, much of whose output goes to fuel oilsands operations. Peyto Exploration & Development Corp. last week set a capital budget of $150 million to $200 million for the year, down $100 million from the forecast it gave in November, and cut its dividend.While many of those moves were cheered by analysts, investors were less enthused. In the first trading session after announcing their plans, Peyto slid 11 per cent, Crescent Point fell 1.3 per cent and Whitecap dropped 6.8 per cent.The message that companies are sending to investors is that they don\u2019t have confidence that the long-term problems the industry is facing \u2014 such as the inability to get new pipelines built \u2014 will be fixed, Lau said. And even though the curtailment program is achieving its goal of boosting Canadian crude prices, the fact that it was even needed sends a negative signal to investors, she said.\u201cIf Alberta, which I\u2019d argue is the most entrepreneurial of the provinces, is seeking government intervention, it just shows things are really bad,\u201d Lau said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Canadian stocks post their best start to the year since 1980", "description": "TSX up seven per cent since Jan. 1 on 11th straight day of gains.

That put the company among the top performers in a year in which the industry saw its biggest loss since 2011, declining 4.1 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.The country\u2019s biggest lenders are Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, along with Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada. Costa declined to name the banks Crescat was shorting. Representatives for Canada\u2019s six biggest banks didn\u2019t immediately comment or declined to comment.Crescat\u2019s short comes amid long-standing warnings from economists, investors and even the Bank of Canada about elevated consumer debt, which was driven higher by a decades-long housing boom. Canada\u2019s ratio of household debt to income has been hovering at about 175 per cent for the past two years, compared with a peak of about 134 per cent in the U.S. at the height of its housing bubble in 2007.Now Canada\u2019s housing market is beginning to cool. Sales plunged 32 per cent in Vancouver last year and 16 per cent in Toronto amid rising interest rates, stricter mortgage rules and new taxes.\u201cChina is in the process of reversing its key role as a driver of global economic growth,\u201d the 29-year-old Costa said. \u201cCountries like Canada and Australia, and their respective housing markets, are the economies most vulnerable in this scenario.\u201dMeanwhile, Crescat calculates that about 80 per cent of Canadian non-financial stocks have been cash-flow negative in the past 12 months, which he measures as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.That may be inflated by the the large numbers of \u201czombie\u201d companies on Canadian stock exchanges, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines as those 10 years and older and whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to cover interest payments on their debts. In a September study, Deloitte found 16 per cent of public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange and its sister Venture Exchange are considered zombies, compared with 10 per cent globally.Cash flow in the energy sector may have been hammered by a slump in crude prices in the past year.But Costa said even if he excludes energy and materials stocks, 70 per cent of Canadian stocks have still lost money on a free cash-flow basis. If you consider only non-financial stocks with a market value of more than $100 million, the share is still more than 50 per cent, he said.\u201cHow is it sustainable for companies that generate no cash to continue to employ people?\u201d Costa said. \u201cMany of these troubled companies would be bankrupt under tighter monetary conditions.\u201dPrevious ShortsThe country\u2019s biggest lenders could face troubles on both the housing and corporate fronts, according to Costa.At their peak last year, the six largest banks, traded at an average of 1.9 times book value, a similar valuation to U.S. banks prior to the global financial crisis in 2008, according to Costa. He expects that to drop to 0.7 times book value or so, where U.S. banks were trading post-financial crisis.Other investors have recommended shorting Canadian financials on a looming housing correction in the past, including Steve Eisman, who predicted the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse.And Canadians bank stocks have largely defied naysayers as the country\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered near records lows amid steady growth \u2014 until recently. The S&P/TSX Composite Commercial Banks Index slumped 11 per cent last year amid market global volatility, the biggest decline since 2008.\u201cMost of these banks are off their highs and have just started to break down,\u201d Costa said.With assistance from Doug Alexander and Brandon Kochkodin.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joanna Ossinger", "title": "Goldman says rich people will drag down the U.S. economy this year", "description": "The stock-market sell-off is going to be a significant drag on the U.S. economy as wealthy households feel its impact, Goldman Sachs says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/goldman-says-rich-people-will-drag-down-the-u-s-economy-by-spending-less", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/tiffany.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2019 12:29 PM EST", "content": "The stock-market sell-off is going to be a significant drag on the U.S. economy this year as wealthy households feel its impact, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Lower equity prices could take half a percentage point off U.S. gross-domestic product growth in 2019, with overall tighter financial conditions restricting expansion by around 1 percentage point, Goldman economist Daan Struyven wrote in a note Tuesday. In October, he had said the positive wealth effect from equity gains in 2017 and early 2018 had likely evaporated.\u201cThe hit to the wealth level from a 1 per cent decline in stock prices is now about three times larger than in the late \u201980s for the top-10 per cent of households and a third larger for those in the 50-90th percentiles,\u201d Struyven said, citing the increase in equity holdings as a share of disposable household income. \nIt\u2019s official: Wall Street just made $100 billion for the first time ever\nThree things that might give investors hope amid fears of a looming recession\nSorry Detroit, the next North American car recession has already started\nStruyven argued against the idea that the wealth effect from the stock market might be limited due to a higher concentration of stock ownership than in previous decades, and a lower propensity to spend among rich households. To prove that this thesis doesn\u2019t hold up, he cited increases in equity holdings, as well as a high sensitivity of luxury-goods spending to stock-market fortunes, as evidence.That\u2019s at odds with a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2013 that finds \u201cat best weak evidence of a link between stock-market wealth and consumption,\u201d and asserts that the housing market has much more of a wealth effect.The share of personal consumption expenditures spent on jewelry is \u201chighly correlated with moves in the stock market,\u201d Struyven wrote in the Jan. 15 report.\u201cFocusing on a sample since 1995, we find large effects of the stock market on luxury spending,\u201d Struyven said.

His bet took a big leap forward on Monday after Chorus surged 15 per cent to $7.24, the biggest gain since 2013. The move came after the Halifax-based company secured a 10-year partnership for its Jazz brand with Air Canada, along with an almost $100 million equity infusion.Another big bet is shares of Markham, Ontario-based Sienna Senior Living Inc., which owns and operates senior-care and retirement facilities in its home province and British Columbia.Owner Operators\u201cDemand for this asset class will rise,\u201d Marr said. \u201cThere will be one million citizens in Canada who will need this service as they enter the later years of retirement and there only 432,000 beds today,\u201d he said.The hedge fund prefers companies in which management or founders hold high stakes, avoiding the energy and materials sectors.

Which ones will make a grand entrance, which will languish and which will stay private? After years of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they toying with investors\u2019 expectations, here are some predictions for\u00a0tech\u2019s most closely watched companies in what promises to be a very eventful 2019. \nRecession bigger worry for Uber, Lyft than who\u2019s first to IPO table\nPinterest is a unicorn but it certainly doesn\u2019t act like one\nCities grapple with \u2018Airbnb effect\u2019 on rentals, but so far the data is limited\nUber and LyftBarring total financial or governmental collapse, Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. look destined to go public this year. Many of the pieces are already in place. Both companies have picked their bankers. In Uber\u2019s camp, there\u2019s Morgan Stanley, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expected to play a supporting role. And for Lyft, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the public offering, along with Credit Suisse Group AG and Jefferies Financial Group Inc.That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be bumps in the road, though. After\u00a0both companies filed confidentially\u00a0to go public on Dec. 6., both are now waiting for feedback on their paperwork from the Securities and Exchange Commission. But if you call the regulator right now, an answering machine will tell you\u00a0it\u2019s closed for business and not really listening to voicemails. Until the government reopens, Uber and Lyft are in a lurch. Whether and how much the shutdown delays their timetable will depend on how much feedback the SEC has for them and when it is sent back.But Washington hijinks are unlikely to derail the ride-hailing giants\u2019 march toward IPO. That\u2019s partly because both companies need a steady stream of investor cash to keep operating. If they didn\u2019t list, they would probably need to tap the private markets again. Another key reason for Uber is that, when it raised money from SoftBank last year, the company agreed to free up some shareholders to sell on the private markets if it didn\u2019t go public in 2019. That\u2019s a situation the startup probably wants to avoid. And finally, the jockeying between Uber and Lyft only ups the competitive pressure for each to list before the other sucks up all the oxygen and investor money.SlackSlack Technologies Inc. has the name recognition of a social media company, but\u00a0the reliable revenue stream\u00a0of business software. The company is clearly targeting a public offering, and has hired Goldman Sachs for the job, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the agreement is private. But a 2019 IPO is far from a sure thing.For one, it\u2019s a much younger service than the other companies on this list. While Slack was founded in 2009 as a gaming company, it didn\u2019t turn into a message application until 2014. Second, Slack isn\u2019t as money-hungry as Uber or Lyft. While its financials aren\u2019t public, the messaging app is likely a leaner business than Uber, which has consistently lost about US$1 billion a quarter.On the other hand, Slack has always been a precocious company. With a US$7.1 billion private valuation, it\u2019s almost worth as much as public messaging app Snap Inc. Last year, Slack filled out its board with\u00a0independent directors\u00a0and hired a\u00a0chief financial officer. Never say never.AirbnbAirbnb Inc. is another big-name San Francisco unicorn in the mix for an IPO this year. For a while, the home-sharing company\u2019s IPO plans seemed to be on ice: The startup, last valued at US$31 billion, fell out of love with its CFO, Laurence Tosi, in 2018, in part, over a disagreement\u00a0with the founders over when to go public. Then, in November, Airbnb hired another high-profile CFO \u2014 Dave Stephenson from Amazon. That\u2019s certainly a move back in the direction of a public listing.Will it happen this year? Or, since the company didn\u2019t raise money last year,\u00a0will it turn\u00a0back to the private markets for additional cash? It\u2019s worth noting that Airbnb is the rare high-flying unicorn that hasn\u2019t taken a big cheque from SoftBank.If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that Airbnb wants a once-in-a-generation public offering. If it doesn\u2019t want to go public in Uber\u2019s shadow, it would likely need to wait until 2020, once Uber has had its turn. On the other hand, Airbnb is facing more and more competition from publicly traded Booking Holdings Inc. Airbnb may want a public stock to make it easier to acquire companies and piece together a more complete travel offering.Palantir and PinterestThe sheen may have worn off these two unicorns a while ago, but each year investors\u2019 IPO dreams resurface before being crushed. Maybe 2019 is different? Palantir, for its part, is\u00a0finally hiring salespeople, an unusually conventional move for the contrarian company.\u00a0Morgan Stanley\u00a0is advising Palantir, though that\u2019s not the same as getting hired for a public offering. Palantir\u2019s public offering documents would be among the most exciting to read because Peter Thiel\u2019s 15-year-old startup has long been such a financial mystery.Pinterest, on the other hand, is struggling to carve out a niche as social media stocks crumble. Pinterest sees itself as something much different from Snapchat or Instagram. People don\u2019t always use its service daily, but when they do, they\u2019re often thinking about buying things. The startup was on track to hit US$700 million in revenue last year, the\u00a0New York Times reported. Still, social media stocks with better user engagement have tanked,\u00a0leaving Pinterest vulnerable.Direct listingsThe last thing to consider here is not only if and when this backlog of high-profile unicorns will go public, but what route they\u2019ll take. Will they do the standard IPO, or will they follow Spotify\u2019s example and list without a fancy roadshow? Uber and Lyft appear to be doing it the old-fashioned way, but Airbnb and Slack\u00a0reportedly considered\u00a0a different path."}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shawna Kwan, Emma Dong and Pooja Thakur", "title": "It\u2019s not just Vancouver: Property market slump goes global, jolting cities from Hong Kong to Sydney", "description": "Rising borrowing costs, increased government regulation and volatile stock markets playing a role, along with dwindling demand from Chinese buyers", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-markets-from-hong-kong-to-sydney-join-global-slump?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/hong-kong.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 4, 2019 10:02 AM EST", "content": "Asia is finally succumbing to the global property slowdown that\u2019s jolted homeowners and investors from Vancouver to London, with markets in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia showing fresh signs of softening.The economic ramifications could be serious.

A simultaneous decline in house prices globally could lead to \u201cfinancial and macroeconomic instability,\u201d the IMF said in study released in April.While each city in the region has its own distinct characteristics, there are a few common denominators: rising borrowing costs, increased government regulation and volatile stock markets.

Concerns about higher borrowing costs and a looming vacancy tax have contributed to the slide.\n\nResidential buildings stand illuminated in Hong Kong, China.\n\nPaul Yeung/Bloomberg\n\nThe strike rate of mainland Chinese developers successfully bidding for residential sites is also waning, tumbling to 27 per cent in 2018 from 70 per cent in 2017, JLL\u2019s Residential Sales Market Monitor released Thursday showed. Of the 11 residential sites tendered by authorities last year, only three were won by Chinese companies.\u201cThe change in attitude can be explained by a slowing mainland economy,\u201d said Henry Mok, JLL\u2019s senior director of capital markets. \u201cThrow in a simmering trade war between China and the U.S., the government has taken actions to restrict capital outflows, which in turn has increased difficulties for developers to invest overseas.\u201dSingaporeHome prices on the island, which regularly ranks among the world\u2019s most expensive places to live, posted their first drop in six quarters in the three months ended December. Luxury was hit the hardest, with values in prime areas sinking 1.5 per cent.Government policies are mainly to blame. Cooling measures implemented unexpectedly in July included higher stamp duties and tougher loan-to-value rules. Extra constraints since then have included curbs on the number of \u201cshoe-box\u201d apartments and anti-money laundering rules that imposed an additional administrative burden on developers.It\u2019s all worked to put the brakes on a home-price recovery that only lasted for five quarters, the shortest since data became available.\u201cLanded home prices, being bigger ticket items, have taken a greater beating as demand softened,\u201d said Ong Teck Hui, a senior director of research and consultancy at JLL. (In Singapore, most people live in high-rise apartments, called housing development board flats. Landed homes by contrast occupy their own ground space.)SydneySydney-siders have begun to wonder \u2014 what sort of economic fallout will there be from the wealth destruction that comes with the worst slump in home values since the late 1980s?Average home values in the harbour city have fallen 11.1 per cent since their 2017 peak, according to CoreLogic Inc. data released Wednesday \u2014 surpassing the 9.6 per cent top-to-bottom decline when Australia was on the cusp of entering its last recession.While prices are still about 60 per cent higher than they were in 2012, meaning few existing homeowners are actually underwater, it\u2019s economist forecasts of a further 10 per cent fall that\u2019s making nervous investors think twice about extraneous spending.The central bank is also worried that a prolonged downturn will drag on consumption and with the main opposition Labor party pledging to curb tax perks for property investors if it wins an election expected in May, confidence is likely to be hit further.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday urged the nation\u2019s banks not to tighten credit any more as the deepening downturn threatens to weigh on the economy.Shanghai, BeijingA crackdown on overheating prices has hampered sales and left values in the nation\u2019s biggest cities around 5 per cent below their peak. Rules on multiple home purchases, or how soon a property can be sold once it\u2019s bought, are starting to be relaxed, and there are giveaways galore as home builders try to lure buyers.One developer in September was giving away a BMW Series 3 or X1 to anyone wishing to purchase a three-bedroom unit or townhouse at its project in Shanghai. Down-payments have also been slashed, with China Evergrande Group asking for just 5 per cent compared with the usual 30 per cent deposit required.\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to see Beijing and Shanghai residential prices fall given the curbing policies currently on these two markets,\u201d said Henry Chin, head of research at CBRE Group Inc. An index that measures second-hand home prices in Beijing has been falling since September while one that tracks Shanghai has been on the decline now for almost 12 months, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ranjeetha Pakiam and Marvin G.

That would be the biggest increase since 2016, when stocks gained 18 per cent.Ten stocks for 2019: What the pros are picking to outperform this yearIt could be worse: An optimist\u2019s guide to investing in 2019Outlook 2019: Here\u2019s where the experts think the TSX will end up one year from now\u201cOur expectation is that 2019 is going to be a better year than 2018 based on the fact that pessimism right now is at extreme levels,\u201d Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital Corp., said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen everybody\u2019s on the same trade, when everybody\u2019s negative, we think this is a good opportunity to go in the other direction.\u201dBangsund expects the S&P/TSX to end 2019 at 16,800 amid strong earnings, and recommends investors overweight beaten-down energy stocks and financials. This time last year, she predicted the market would finish 2018 at 16,900 and later raised that target to 17,300.Instead, the Canadian benchmark fell 12 per cent in 2018 to 14,323, with most of that drop coming in the final quarter of the year amid a decline in global stocks. Concerns about a global trade war, rising interest rates, a housing slowdown and plunging oil prices all weighed on the Canadian market.Crude RealityEnergy stocks were the worst performers, posting a decline of 21 per cent, followed by consumer discretionary, down 18 per cent. Even pot stocks, which were a bastion of optimism for Canadian investors as the country legalized recreational marijuana, ended the year in negative territory.It\u2019s been a frustrating experience for investors and strategists alike. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, had a strong track record of calling the market before 2018. His forecast for the S&P/TSX in 2017 was only 200 points below the final closing number while his 2016 forecast came within 12 points of the close. His estimate of 17,600 for 2018 was off by a wide margin, however. Belski sees 2019 ending at 18,000, 26 per cent above current levels.Bear Facts\u201cFundamentals can, will, and should be rewarded at some point,\u201d he wrote in a 2019 market outlook published in November. \u201cIn our view, the best time to be contrarian is when the analysis is telling you something exceedingly different from what sentiment and rhetoric is exhibiting.\u201d He added that \u201cCanada is rich with solid companies\u201d and investors should take a bottom-up approach to stock picking, paying particular attention to energy and financials.Not everyone is optimistic there will be a big rebound. Sadiq Adatia, who manages about $23 billion (US$17 billion) as chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments, sees the S&P/TSX closing out the year at 15,000, just 4.7 per cent above current levels. Adatia was the most bearish forecaster last year as well, initially predicting the benchmark would end the year at 15,200 and later raising that to a range of 16,000 to 16,250.\u201cWhat has me worried is that consumers are losing steam\u201d amid rising interest rates, Adatia said in a phone interview, adding that he expects the Bank of Canada will hike rates once in 2019 but would prefer if it didn\u2019t hike at all.\u201cRates will impact how consumers spend going forward, how they deal with their debt levels and what happens in the housing market as well,\u201d he said. However, Canada may not fare as badly as some of its global counterparts.\u201cWe think if you hold a portion of your portfolio in Canada, it\u2019s because of risk management,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get a major continuation of the selloff and we get into bear market territory, Canada might actually hold up relatively well because it hasn\u2019t participated fully on the upside of this bull market.\u201dHere are the strategists\u2019 calls for 2019, ranked from bears to bulls:Sun Life: 15,000Edward Jones: 15,600Russell Investments: 16,000Scotia Capital: 16,500Fiera Capital: 16,800Manulife: 17,250BMO Capital Markets: 18,000Laurentian Bank: 18,000Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sophie Alexander and Jack Witzig", "title": "These are the world's biggest billionaire winners and losers of the year", "description": "Markets may be tanking, but that hasn't stopped plenty of mega-fortunes from being unearthed in 2018", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/here-are-the-worlds-biggest-billionaire-winners-and-losers-of-2018", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/billionaires.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 1, 2019 6:42 AM EST", "content": "The markets may be tanking, but that hasn\u2019t stopped plenty of mega-fortunes from being unearthed in 2018.The popularity of Fortnite, the phenomenon that forced some into video-game rehab, gave gamemaker Tim Sweeney a US$7.2 billion fortune this year.

Fed officials also maintained a generally upbeat view of the economy even as they trimmed their own projections for future rate increases. Observers offered several possible explanations for the risk-off response in markets.Markets Snubbed?Some thought that the written statement from the Federal Open Market Committee didn\u2019t sufficiently address mounting market strains, which have seen U.S. stocks hammered and bond yields tumble in recent weeks.Fed raises interest rates, turns more cautious on outlook for 2019 hikesU.S. Federal Reserve hikes rate: Read the official statementPace of Bank of Canada rate hikes could be interrupted, Stephen Poloz says\u201cThe Fed is indicating that it\u2019s listening to the markets, it has respect for the markets, but it\u2019s not going to be ruled by the markets,\u201d said Greg Staples, co-head of Americas fixed income at DWS, following the decision.The press conference from Chairman Jerome Powell also did little to ease market disappointment. He noted that the FOMC \u201ctook on board the tightening in financial conditions,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t focusing on any single market. What matters for the economy is broad changes that are sustained, the chairman said.The reality is the market just doesn't agree with their growth outlook \n \nConcern Over ProjectionsAnother concern, according to Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s Gene Tannuzzo, is that the Fed hasn\u2019t sufficiently downgraded its rate projections and is underestimating the growth challenges ahead.\u201cThe reality is the market just doesn\u2019t agree with their growth outlook,\u201d Tannuzzo said in an interview following Powell\u2019s press conference. He pointed out that the Fed\u2019s summary of rate projections \u2014 known as the dot plot \u2014 is becoming a liability for the FOMC. This is because market participants continue to fixate on it as a prediction rather than as a scenario that\u2019s subject to incoming data and the Fed\u2019s changing economic outlook.Balance-Sheet UnwindA third concern is a general unease about the Fed\u2019s unwind of quantitative easing, which some feel is a genuine threat to market liquidity. Guggenheim\u2019s Scott Minerd attributed the stock market\u2019s swoon to Powell\u2019s apparent inflexibility on shrinking the balance sheet.When Powell spoke about how he wouldn\u2019t look at adjusting the pace of balance-sheet reduction \u201cthe market took a decided crack down,\u201d according to Minerd.Despite its more technical nature relative to the adjustment of the fed funds rate, the balance sheet has loomed larger among investors\u2019 concerns of late. Ben Jeffery of Bank of Montreal attributed this increased focus in part to recent tweeting by U.S. President Donald Trump.\u201cThe fact Trump mentioned the balance sheet earlier this week has brought it top of mind for a lot of people,\u201d Jeffery said.With assistance from Alexandra HarrisBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Vildana Hajric", "title": "U.S. stocks close at 14-month low in broad sell-off that shaved 500 points off the Dow", "description": "The S&P 500 Index finished Monday\u2019s session its lowest level since October 2017", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/dow-plunges-almost-600-points-sp-nears-2018-low-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/trader-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 17, 2018 4:24 PM EST", "content": "U.S. equity indexes slid to their lowest close in 14 months as investors weighed the impact of the Federal Reserve on growth in an economy already anxious over trade, geopolitical tensions and a possible government shutdown.The S&P 500 Index finished Monday\u2019s session its lowest level since October 2017.

Other blends, including Edmonton Mixed Sweet and Syncrude, also are surging.Oil producers are saying the 8-day-old plan will bring \u201csignificant relief\u201d to the province\u2019s pipeline congestion problem, and it\u2019s even being credited with preventing layoffs for at least one major oil-sands company. The 325,000-barrel-a-day supply cut takes effect next month.Don\u2019t kid yourself, we\u2019re facing a made-in-Canada energy crisisBack from the dead: Notley\u2019s oil cut sends Canadian crude prices, energy stocks skyrocketingHow the oil crisis in Alberta is boosting crude prices around the world\u201cIt\u2019s working \u2014 the proof is in the price,\u201d said Tim Pickering, chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. \u201cThe amount of the curtailment was enough to make a measurable difference in the glut that we have.\u201dThe plan announced by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley probably has encouraged producers to start dialling back output because they know they can do so without putting themselves at a disadvantage to rivals, Pickering said. As oil suppliers and refiners negotiate sales for the months ahead, the Western Canadian discount may continue tightening into March, he said.Still, uncertainty abounds. Before the production cuts were announced, companies had started to slash dividends and delay 2019 drilling plans, and it may take more than a week of stronger prices for them to reverse those moves.Layoffs AvoidedThe first signals may come this week as explorers announce 2019 budgets. Capital spending among Canada\u2019s explorers and producers may increase 5 per cent in 2019, trailing the 10 per cent growth in the U.S., according to a survey conducted by Evercore ISI.Despite the survey\u2019s results, Evercore analysts led by James West doubt Canadian capital spending will live up to the optimism expressed by executives in the survey. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. last week pegged its 2019 plan at $3.7 billion, or about $1 billion less than normal.For other companies, the provincial output caps may have staved off drastic cuts. MEG Energy Corp. chief executive Derek Evans said last week that the curtailment prevented the company from laying off workers and trying to \u201cabsolutely minimize\u201d capital spending.There are worries about longer term effects as well. The plan has stirred concerns that the government intervention adds another layer of risk for investors and weakens the relative value of companies like Suncor Energy Inc., whose significant refining capabilities had helped it better weather the price downturn, according to Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal.The mixed sentiment is reflected in the muted response in Canadian energy shares since the curtailment announcement. The S&P/TSX Energy Index has slid about 3 per cent since the policy was introduced, a period coinciding with a global market meltdown that also includes a roughly 3.3 per cent drop for the broader S&P/TSX index.\u201cThe Alberta intervention works over the short term,\u201d Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a note Monday. \u201cA greater concern arises if Alberta doesn\u2019t quickly remove the constraints when new pipelines come on line and becomes used to leaning on this crutch in support of higher prices longer term.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Bloomberg News", "title": "China accuses Canada of violating bilateral agreement in Huawei arrest", "description": "Ottawa warned it could face \u2018severe consequences\u2019 if Wanzhou Meng not released immediately", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/china-says-canada-violated-bilateral-agreement-in-huawei-arrest?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/huawei-hearing.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 10, 2018 12:25 PM EST", "content": "China accused Canada of violating a bilateral agreement by failing to speedily inform its consulate of the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.

The case has become a flash-point in ties between the U.S. and China that\u2019s rattled investors and sent stock markets tumbling.Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng warned Canada\u2019s ambassador that his nation could face \u201csevere consequences\u201d if it didn\u2019t release Meng immediately.

Supreme Court in Vancouver on Friday.\n\nCanadian Press/Jane Wolsak\n\nChina and the U.S. are grappling with how to react to the incident, which threatens to upend progress in trade talks achieved in Argentina. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade team sought to insulate talks with China from the growing dispute on Sunday, while officials in Beijing have debated the pros and cons of retaliation.On Friday, the U.S. began a case against the Chinese telecoms giant in a Vancouver courtroom, alleging Meng had hidden ties between Huawei and a company called Skycom that did business in Iran, a lawyer representing Canada said during the court hearing. Canada is presenting the case on behalf of the U.S., which wants to extradite Meng.Her lawyers have cited health issues in a bid to free the Huawei finance chief, painting a picture of a cancer survivor who\u2019s undergone multiple surgeries and needs daily medication to cope with a plethora of health issues. They also outlined how her entire family has deep roots in Vancouver, where she\u2019s being held. She\u2019s also offered to put up a couple of multi-million-dollar homes as collateral.Meng\u2019s case has struck a nerve with Chinese officials in part because Huawei, founded by her father Ren Zhengfei, is a national champion at the forefront of President Xi Jinping\u2019s efforts for China to be self-sufficient in strategic technologies.Along with Huawei\u2019s growing prominence has come increased scrutiny from the U.S. and its allies over fears its equipment could be used for spying, with Kyodo News reporting that Japan could join Australia and New Zealand in keeping Chinese equipment away from their phone networks. China seeks fair, transparent and non-discriminatory treatment from Japan, Lu said.Lu also pushed back against comments from those in other nations who allege Huawei may pose a security threat, saying there isn\u2019t any evidence of cyber-security problems.\u201cI want to stress that the Chinese laws and regulations do not authorize any institutions to force any enterprise to install forced backdoors,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThe Chinese government always encourages its enterprises to abide by international rules and local laws.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "David Tweed and Peter Martin", "title": "\u2018Shocking\u2019\u00a0arrest of Huawei CFO in Canada threatens to upend trade truce between U.S. and China", "description": "While the U.S. routinely asks allies to extradite drug lords, arms dealers and other criminals, arresting a major Chinese executive like this is rare \u2014 if not unprecedented", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/shocking-huawei-arrest-threatens-to-upend-trump-xi-trade-truce?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/meng-wanzhou.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 6, 2018 7:50 AM EST", "content": "On the same day Donald Trump and Xi Jinping struck a trade war truce in Argentina, some 7,000 miles away Canadian authorities made an arrest that now threatens to make the U.S.-China conflict much worse.The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Wanzhou Meng, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co., after convincing Canada to arrest her on Dec. 1, likely in connection with violating sanctions against Iran. China immediately reacted with outrage on Wednesday, demanding that both countries move to free Meng. Later, the foreign ministry said it was still waiting for details on why she was arrested, and said trade talks should continue.The timing and manner of this is shocking.

The U.S. leader has spent the past few days seeking to convince the world \u2014 and skeptical equity investors \u2014 that China has agreed to major concessions, including reducing or removing tariffs on U.S. cars. Stocks fell across Asia on Thursday.\n\nA newspaper featuring a front page story about the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a news stand in Beijing on Dec. 3. The headline says the two leaders agreed not to increase tarrifs. China\u2019s state-run media hailed the trade war truce with the United States as \u201cmomentous\u201d but warned of complex negotiations ahead.\n\nGreg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnalysts said it\u2019s more likely the case proceeded separately from the trade talks as part of Trump\u2019s efforts to step up prosecutions against Chinese companies that conduct economic espionage and violate sanctions. In October, the U.S. said Belgium extradited a Chinese intelligence official accused of stealing trade secrets from U.S. companies \u2014 an unprecedented development.Either way, China is almost certain to view Meng\u2019s arrest as a major escalation in the trade war that will foment fears of a wider Cold War between the world\u2019s biggest economies. As part of trade talks, Trump has insisted that China stop providing government support to strategic sectors including artificial intelligence and robotics as part of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d policy.\u2018New Game\u2019\u201cIt will definitely complicate the negotiations and they may believe this was done to increase the pressure during this 90-day period,\u201d said Dennis Wilder, a former CIA China analyst and senior director for Asia at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.\u201cThis is sending a signal that there is a new game,\u201d Wilder said of the recent U.S. arrests. \u201cThey are trying to deter Chinese espionage and make it clear that there are real consequences.\u201dPerhaps no company better personifies the perceived trade threat than Huawei. It\u2019s overtaken Apple Inc. in smartphone shipments and aims to surpass Samsung Electronics Co. while targeting record sales of US$102.2 billion this year \u2014 more than Boeing Co. It\u2019s shooting for the lead in fifth-generation wireless networks and preparing to take on some of America\u2019s biggest chipmakers.That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s administration invoked its name in blocking a Qualcomm Inc.-Broadcom Inc. merger that would\u2019ve been the largest deal ever, saying it would hand the lead in 5G to China. Huawei has since been blocked from selling its gear in Australia and New Zealand, got frozen out of a Korean contract, and faces U.S.-led competition even in Papua New Guinea.The latest U.S. action against Huawei may be even more significant. While the company has made advances in developing its own microchips, it still relies on American equipment to make its networking gear and smartphones. ZTE Corp., another Chinese technology company, nearly collapsed due to U.S. penalties for violating Iran sanctions before Trump rescued it following a request from Xi.The ZTE case showed China\u2019s leaders that they needed to become independent from the U.S. when it comes to critical technologies like semiconductors and network infrastructure, according to Graham Webster, coordinating editor of DigiChina at the Washington-based think tank New America.\u201cWhat makes Huawei important is that it is a leader in developing technologies that will make China less dependent on U.S. or European suppliers,\u201d he said. \u201cTargeting Huawei through seeking the extradition of a top executive is a major move by the U.S. government, whether coordinated or not.\u201dFor some analysts in China, it shows that the U.S. national security apparatus isn\u2019t interested in cutting a deal, no matter what Trump thinks.\u201cTheir goal is to decouple with China,\u201d said Wang\u00a0Yong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University. \u201cNegotiations are the wish of Trump and Wall Street.\u201dWith file from ReutersBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek, Vildana Hajric and Luke Kawa", "title": "Dow plunges almost 800 points over flattening yield curve, lost confidence on U.S.-China trade deal", "description": "Observers calling out Trump over whether trade talks had created any meaningful breakthrough", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-rally-evaporates-as-u-s-china-trade-deal-loses-investor-confidence", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/aus_stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 4, 2018 4:30 PM EST", "content": "U.S. stocks plunged, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling almost 800 points, as a litany of concerns wiped out the rally in risk assets.Trade-sensitive shares sank as angst mounted that the U.S. and China made no meaningful progress on the trade front this weekend.

However, McNulty and Hatziioannou found they were turning down investments because Canopy was only interested in companies it could own and operate.\u201cWe decided to create a separate vehicle where we would could take minority interests, create alternative transaction structures and provide both growth capital and strategic support,\u201d McNulty said.That vehicle became Canopy Rivers, which is about 25 per cent owned by Canopy Growth and counts chief executive officer Bruce Linton as its acting CEO and chairman. Canopy Rivers listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in September via a reverse takeover after raising $104 million in a private placement. It closed Friday with a market value of $685 million, down 54 per cent since it\u2019s listing on Sept. 20.Sicilian FarmersCanopy Rivers\u2019 portfolio consists of 11 companies including Civilized Worldwide Inc., a cannabis media and lifestyle brand, LiveWell Foods Canada Inc., a nutritional company that sells hemp products, and Canapar Italy, a firm that works with Sicilian farmers to cultivate hemp.Another holding, a Canadian licensed producer called TerrAscend Corp., will give Canopy Rivers an indirect entree into the U.S. market that could act as a model for future U.S. investments.TerrAscend wants to expand into the U.S. market through acquisitions and is able to do so because it\u2019s listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, which allows U.S.-focused pot firms. However two of its largest shareholders, the Canopy companies, wouldn\u2019t be able to remain shareholders because of their exchange restrictions. To solve this problem, the two Canopys agreed to convert their common shares in TerrAscend into exchangeable shares, which can\u2019t be transferred or monetized and aren\u2019t entitled to voting rights or dividends. If U.S. federal law changes, they can be converted back into common shares.\u201cIt was important for us to try to make sure that we maintained our investor base and kept them happy,\u201d TerrAscend CEO Michael Nashat said in an interview. \u201cWe see the U.S. market as the next big boom and now we can pursue this opportunity.\u201dIf the arrangement is approved by TerrAscend shareholders, which is expected to happen by the end of the month, it could set a compelling precedent for other U.S.-related transactions, McNulty said.Meanwhile, there are no shortage of other investment opportunities for Canopy Rivers to consider.\u201cThe deal flow is sometimes overwhelming,\u201d McNulty said. \u201cWe\u2019ve evaluated hundreds and hundreds of opportunities but we\u2019re very picky because we\u2019re trying to get it right for every investment.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Giammona", "title": "Cannabis startup backed by Brian Mulroney and John Boehner goes public in Canada", "description": "Acreage Holdings is valued at about US$2.8 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/marijuana-startup-backed-by-john-boehner-goes-public-in-canada?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/boehner.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 15, 2018 11:46 AM EST", "content": "The cannabis startup backed by former Speaker of the House John Boehner is set to become one of the most valuable companies in the U.S. weed industry.Acreage Holdings is the latest U.S. cannabis firm to tap the public markets in Canada, where marijuana is legal, through a reverse takeover.

The federal ban in the U.S. has made it tricky for entrepreneurs to raise domestic capital because most banks and large institutional investors remain on the sidelines. That\u2019s why many are turning to the Canadian stock market.Following the midterm elections, which saw Democrats take control of the House of Representatives as voters eased weed regulations eased in three states, there\u2019s renewed optimism that the federal government could end marijuana prohibition.

Acreage has since acquired licenses in Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, Florida, New York and other states.

Ultimately, the U.S. industry is expected to be more than 10 times larger than the market in Canada. While federal legalization has given Canadian companies a head start, U.S. companies hope to quickly close the gap, Murphy said.\u201cWe\u2019ll be lock step in competition with the Canadians,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe one huge advantage we have is local knowledge of the business here in the U.S.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
