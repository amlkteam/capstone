Last week he said the city\u2019s retail outlets would be allowed to open May 11; the new date is May 18.Next door in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford indicated he would continue to take a slow approach to restarting Canada\u2019s biggest provincial economy. Ford said the province is getting close to allowing more retail stores to open for curbside pickup \u2014 as long as virus cases continue to decline. He didn\u2019t give a date. \nWhy reopening the economy is just the start of even more headaches for already struggling businesses\nQuebec\u2019s seemingly aggressive plan to reopen the economy next week seen as a risk worth taking\nShockproofing Canada: Here\u2019s what it will take to reopen the economy\nGetting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada\u2019s deaths as of Monday.Hospitals \u2018Very Tight\u2019The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,\u201d Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec\u2019s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is \u201cvery tight,\u201d he said.Quebec\u2019s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec\u2019s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsQuebec Premier Francois Legault \n \nMeanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We\u2019re going to get the economy going based on health and science,\u201d he said at a news conference in Toronto. \u201cJust because we open up these stores it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a free-for-all.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces", "description": "Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government \u2014 which could trigger a downgrade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country\u2019s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada\u2019s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada\u2019s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days. \nShockproofing Canada: Here\u2019s what it will take to reopen the economy\nAlberta\u2019s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility\nHow to help the provinces weather the COVID-19 economic shock\nLast week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.\u201cThere is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point\u201d for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.A \u2018Weak\u2019 AAACanadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada\u2019s profile as similar to Australia \u2014 whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 \u2014 and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada\u2019s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.\u201cThe fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low \u2014 I think that will be very important for the credit rating,\u201d said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada\u2019s top credit rating as \u201cextremely resilient,\u201d citing the central government\u2019s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is \u201camong the weak\u201d AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn\u2019t an automatic trigger for a credit action.Implicit SupportWhile the federal government doesn\u2019t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s rating of A1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of \u201ca high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in an April 1 statement. Moody\u2019s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It\u2019s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.\u201cWe still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,\u201d said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.\u201cOil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,\u201d said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That\u2019s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.\u201cProvincials are absolutely key for Canada\u2019s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm. \nHome sales activity crashed last month, but here\u2019s why property prices will not \u2014 for now\nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nHow to buy and sell a house in the time of coronavirus, from virtual tours to hazmat home inspections\n\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.\u201dSince the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. \u201cShould someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?\u201d asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. \u201cWhere exactly do we draw the line?\u201dA \u2018Flammable\u2019 MarketThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.\n\nResidential condo buildings and single family houses are seen above Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDarryl Dyck/Bloomberg files\n\nThat virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted \n \nToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dAirbnb Customers VanishIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.\n\nThe logo of the online lodging service Airbnb on a smartphone.\n\nLionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nThen there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Eric Martin", "title": "\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years", "description": "In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/imf-says-great-lockdown-recession-likely-worst-since-depression?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 12:52 PM EDT", "content": "The International Monetary Fund predicted the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d recession would be the steepest in almost a century and warned the world economy\u2019s contraction and recovery would be worse than anticipated if the coronavirus lingers or returns.In its first World Economic Outlook report since the spread of the coronavirus and subsequent freezing of major economies, the IMF estimated on Tuesday that global gross domestic product will shrink 3 per cent this year.That compares to a January projection of 3.3 per cent expansion and would likely mark the deepest dive since the Great Depression. It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockGita Gopinath, IMF's chief economist \n \nWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency. \nAdvanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs\nThe \u2018terrible agonizing noise\u2019 of Canada\u2019s economic data in a crisis like no other\nMillennials are getting crushed by back-to-back economic crises\nIn a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF\u2019s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week.

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada ekes out meagre growth in January before COVID-19 pandemic shut down economy", "description": "Gross domestic product rose 0.1 per cent from December, missing economist estimates for a 0.2 per cent gain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-ekes-out-meager-growth-in-january-before-pandemic?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/economy.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 31, 2020 2:15 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy expanded less than expected in January even before the pandemic caused a virtual shutdown, reinforcing views the first quarter will be weak.Gross domestic product rose 0.1 per cent from December, missing economist estimates for a 0.2 per cent gain, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.

With only an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of storage capacity still available, producers will be forced to cut output because by June there\u2019ll be no place left to put the unwanted crude, it said.The oil market has been hammered by falling demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Saudi Arabia vows to flood the market with crude at deep discounts, following the collapse of the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full. Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, two of the world\u2019s top merchants, say there\u2019s heavy interest in storing while several traders have booked supertankers to hoard barrels at sea. \nThe crisis facing Canada\u2019s oilpatch isn\u2019t just industry\u2019s problem, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s problem\n'Very, very frightening': Calls for government bailout grow louder as oilpatch faces bleak outlook\nAid to oilpatch coming in 'hours, potentially days,' Morneau says, as Alberta braces for severe 5.6% GDP contraction this year\nSupply may exceed demand by 12.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, with other traders, banks and consultants also forecasting bumper surpluses, IHS said. Vitol said on Wednesday that demand has fallen as much as 20 million barrels a day from last year.\u201cProduction is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS. \u201cIt is now a matter of where and by how much.\u201dU.S. ConcernsThere are already signs in prices about a potential scarcity of storage space. In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world\u2019s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said. Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up. Saudi Arabia has 18 days, and the U.S. has 30.Nigeria, the biggest producer in Africa, is the most vulnerable among the areas measured by IHS. Estimated first-quarter 2020 daily production of 1.9 million barrels a day would fill up available local storage in 1 1/2 to two days, the firm said.Consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. also sees storage tanks filling in the coming months.\u201cWith OPEC pushing output to record highs, inventories will quickly get out of hand,\u201d the firm said in a note. \u201cWe will run out of crude storage capacity by early Q3 20, with product containment arriving earlier.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove, Laura Litvan and Steven T.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn\u2019t require members to travel to Washington \u2014 as long as the bill does not have any \u201cpoison pills\u201d Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the \u201cthe president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation\u2019s economy as we work through this crisis.\u201dThe size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation\u2019s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third \u2014 and biggest \u2014 plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing.

Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus.

That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009.

Monday\u2019s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added. \nPeter Tertzakian: This crude war is about a lot more than oil prices and market share\nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nOil price war tests Canadian energy producers' years-long drive to cut costs\nThe oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growthBeata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank \n \n\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.Trudeau\u2019s TurnThe Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Simon Kennedy and Lucy Meakin", "title": "Central banks vow to act as OECD warns world economy faces \u2018greatest danger\u2019 since the financial crisis", "description": "Chance Fed could make emergency cut before March meeting", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/central-banks-pledge-to-ensure-stability-as-oecd-sounds-alarm?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 2, 2020 11:40 AM EST", "content": "Global central banks promised to act as needed to stabilize markets rattled by the coronavirus as the OECD warned the world economy faces its \u201cgreatest danger\u201d since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.Some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008 \n \nIn an emergency statement, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will \u201cstrive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets.\u201d The Bank of England followed by saying it\u2019s working with U.K. and international authorities to \u201censure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.\u201d Already on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates to contain what he called the \u201cevolving risks\u201d to economic growth from the virus. The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a \u2018long lasting\u2019 epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks\u2019 action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis.

The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.\u201cGlobal central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201dWith interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.\u201cCentral banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, \u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.Japan to IndonesiaThe Bank of Japan backed up Monday\u2019s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia\u2019s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan\u2019s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan\u2019s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed\u2019s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn\u2019t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde\u2019s comments of last week.\u201cWe are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Less Effective?Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closed \n \nFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That\u2019s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world\u2019s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won\u2019t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they\u2019re worried about infection.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Anooja Debnath", "title": "Euro Forecasters See a World-Beating\u00a0Run in 2020", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 After two years of setbacks, the euro is enjoying a wave of much-needed investor optimism as 2019 draws to a close.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/euro-forecasters-see-a-world-beating-run-in-2020", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "December 27, 2019 2:42 PM EST", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 After two years of setbacks, the euro is enjoying a wave of much-needed investor optimism as 2019 draws to a close.The shared currency will rally more than 4% against the dollar in 2020 in the world\u2019s best foreign-exchange performance, according to the median estimates of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.

Next year doesn\u2019t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That\u2019s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January.Canada\u2019s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they\u2019ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3 per cent since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased 1 per cent in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal.You don't have a domestic demand story that's strongBrett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank \n \nBusiness investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures.Consumption has long propelled Canada\u2019s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that\u2019s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigour is most apparent in a retail sector that\u2019s seen volumes flat over the past year.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a domestic demand story that\u2019s strong,\u201d said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.One bright spot in the GDP numbers could be housing, which has rebounded as borrowing costs decline and buyers adjust to tighter mortgage rules. Home sales rose 7.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest quarterly pace since the end of 2017. Most economists estimate residential investment picked up for a second straight quarter.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ben Steverman", "title": "Baby boomers are thriving\u00a0on an 'unprecedented' $9-trillion inheritance", "description": "Inheritances are part of a dynamic that's widening the wealth gap between generations", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/baby-boomers-are-thriving-on-an-unprecedented-9-trillion-inheritance", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/inheritance.jpg", "publishedAt": "November 19, 2019 10:42 AM EST", "content": "The rich aren\u2019t just getting richer. They\u2019re getting older. And, fortunately for their children, they\u2019re set to leave plenty of money in the bank.About US$36 trillion will flow from one generation to another over the next 30 years, according to a report Tuesday from wealth manager United Income. The pace of bequests has already started surging. Americans inherited US$427 billion in 2016, the most recent data available, up 119 per cent from 1989 even after adjusting for inflation.\u201cWealth equal to nearly two times the size of the U.S. GDP is expected to be gifted to charities and heirs over the next few decades,\u201d said United Income founder Matt Fellowes. \u201cIt\u2019s a historically unprecedented amount that is almost incomprehensibly large.\u201d \nHow to save for retirement at a time when most aren\u2019t saving much at all\nIf you want to keep wealth in the family, be careful how you bequeath it\nGeneration X is \u2018stretched beyond their financial limits\u2019 and struggling to save for retirement\nThe beneficiaries aren\u2019t all that young themselves. The study, which uses Federal Reserve and academic data, shows that from 1989 to 2016 U.S. households inherited more than US$8.5 trillion. Over that time, the average age of recipients rose by a decade to 51. More than a quarter of bequests now go to adults 61 or older.\u201cInstead of diapers and school, inheritances are increasingly going toward medical bills and retirement savings,\u201d Fellowes said.Even inheritances, then, are part of a dynamic that\u2019s widening the wealth gap between generations. Americans younger than 50 held just 16 per cent of all investable assets in 2016, down from 31 per cent in 1989, according to the Fed\u2019s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, leaving the rest to households 50 and older.Instead of diapers and school, inheritances are increasingly going toward medical bills and retirement savings \n \nAge inequality is most dramatic when comparing the oldest and youngest adults. In 1989, the median household age 65 to 75 held almost eight times more wealth than families headed by 25- to 35-year-olds. By 2016, according to an analysis by the St. Louis Fed, the median baby boomer had close to 13 times more wealth than the typical millennial.While boomers as a group inherited trillions from their parents, most members of the postwar generation got nothing. About 20 per cent of households have received inheritances, United Income\u2019s analysis shows, a share that\u2019s flat over the past 30 years.The good news is that these bequests are coming in handy. The median recipient gets about US$55,000, which is more than double their typical retirement savings.\n\nWhile boomers as a group inherited trillions from their parents, most members of the postwar generation got nothing.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\u201cMost inheritances are going to older adults who have little in the way of retirement savings,\u201d said Fellowes, a former Brookings Institution scholar. \u201cPeople receiving inheritances are pretty middle class.\u201dUnited Income, an online retirement planning firm, was founded in 2016 and acquired in July by Capital One Financial Corp.As more Americans live longer without the safety net of a traditional pension, the data suggest they\u2019re spending frugally to make sure their wealth lasts. The result is more Americans dying before they can spend all of their savings. Financial advisers say they often need to encourage affluent clients to enjoy their wealth rather than hoarding it.Only about 9 per cent of estates consist entirely of a house or other property, United Income\u2019s analysis shows. The average estate is 46 per cent stocks, bonds, cash and other liquid investments \u2014 giving an immediate boost to recipients\u2019 own retirement planning at a key time.The money left behind for middle-class Americans is dwarfed by that inherited by the children of the very wealthy. United Income\u2019s estimates don\u2019t include gifts made during donors\u2019 lifetimes \u2014 a typical move in estate planning for the ultra-high net worth cohort, often using trusts. It still found a widening gulf between the super rich and everyone else.The median inheritance has risen only about US$15,000 in three decades, while they\u2019ve more than doubled for the 0.3 per cent of Americans receiving at least US$1 million. In 1989, their inheritances averaged an inflation-adjusted US$2.7 million. By 2016, they were each getting an average of US$6.6 million.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Robert Brand", "title": "S&P 500 just hit another record high \u2014 and everything\u2019s flashing Risk On", "description": "Optimism over trade deal with China", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-stocks-hit-record-on-trade-hopes-bonds-drop-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "October 28, 2019 10:33 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks reclaimed an all-time high after three months, with the final leg coming on rising optimism for a trade deal with China.

That far exceeds the C$14 billion deficit recorded in 2018. In total, the plan would add an additional $31.5 billion in deficits and bring the cumulative budget gap over the next four years to $93 billion. \nGimme shelter: Breaking down the housing promises on the campaign trail\nBreaking down the parties\u2019 tax-cut pledges in an election that\u2019s evolved into a bidding war for votes\nConservatives court small business, pledging to end red tape \u2018rat\u2019s nest\u2019\nPolitically, the Liberals hope the higher deficits will give them a potential wedge issue in a campaign where the two major parties have rolled out similar policy objectives -\u2013 from tax cuts to helping first time home buyers and seniors. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has yet to release his full fiscal projection but has promised to eventually return the budget to balance, though only over five years.In fact, given Scheer\u2019s reluctance for a quick return to balance, both the Liberal and Conservative plans are poised to deliver a boost to the economy next year, no matter who wins. It\u2019s perhaps even enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider cutting interest rates, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.\u201cIt seems clear whoever is in power, you are looking at a bigger deficit than had there not been an election,\u201d Perrault said in a telephone interview.Opinion polls show the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives, despite Trudeau\u2019s campaign being jolted by revelations he wore black and brownface makeup numerous times as a younger man. Seat projections tabulated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show neither party holding enough support to win a majority.Deficits matter in Canada, with a collective aversion to debt that was cemented in the mid-1990s amid ratings agency downgrades, a falling currency and a national unity crisis. It remains an explosive issue, even though Trudeau\u2019s deficits have hovered at less than 1 per cent of GDP, far below many other western nations. The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada\u2019s budget would be back in balance.Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he\u2019s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.\u201cI will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity \u2014 if they really think so \u2014 are going to help Canadians,\u201d Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.Trudeau\u2019s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation\u2019s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory \u2014 but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That\u2019s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years\u2019 time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada\u2019s AAA credit rating.There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional C$2 billion as early as next year by undertaking \u201ca new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.\u201dThey also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion.

France\u2019s drug safety regulator, the Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament, said in a statement dated Wednesday that it ordered a recall of all brand-name and generic Zantac available in pharmacies.European and U.S. health officials said earlier this month they are looking into how the drugs came to be contaminated. Zantac and its generic equivalents are used by millions of people, including pregnant women and infants, to treat gastrointestinal disorders and discomfort. Recalls or distribution halts have also been announced by multiple manufacturers. \nPurdue Pharma files for bankruptcy to wipe out 2,000 OxyContin lawsuits\nBig pharma opioid fines could hit US$150 billion. That\u2019s more than Ukraine\u2019s GDP\nPfizer-Mylan generic giant solves two problems with one deal\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating the carcinogen levels and hasn\u2019t required any recalls or distribution halts. Canadian health officials required drugmakers last week to halt distribution of all versions of Zantac.California Representative Anna Eshoo, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s health panel, wrote the FDA last week with concerns about its efforts on Zantac, known in its generic form as ranitidine.\u201cThe United States has moved slowly to address this cancer risk,\u201d Eshoo wrote Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the letter reviewed by Bloomberg.At Eshoo\u2019s urging, she and Woodcock are set to talk Monday about the FDA\u2019s response, according to the congresswoman\u2019s office.\u201cFDA is continuing to test ranitidine products from multiple manufacturers and assess the possible effect on patients who have been taking ranitidine,\u201d the agency said in the statement Thursday.Novartis AG\u2019s Sandoz unit recalled its generic prescription Zantac in the U.S. earlier this week after detecting elevated levels of the carcinogen NDMA. The carcinogen is the same one that last year sparked a recall in about 30 countries of millions of blood-pressure pills called angiotensin II receptor blockers. Sandoz has also halted worldwide distribution of its generic Zantac.The FDA asked all makers of brand-name and generic Zantac to test their own products for NDMA.GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the original branded maker of Zantac, halted global distribution of the drug Wednesday and recalled its pills in India and Hong Kong. The recalled medicine is made with an active ingredient from two India-based suppliers, Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Ltd. and Saraca Laboratories Ltd., Kristen Neese, a spokeswoman for Glaxo, said in an email Wednesday. Some European regulators have initiated recalls of ranitidine made with active ingredient from Saraca as well.Dr. Reddy\u2019s, one of India\u2019s largest generic drugmakers, is cleared to sell its own finished versions of prescription and over-the-counter generic Zantac in the U.S. It hasn\u2019t recalled any product, but last week it suspended all its shipments of the drug.A recall means drugs must come off of pharmacy shelves, while a distribution halt means the company is no longer supplying the drugs, though typically those already on shelves can be sold.Glaxo doesn\u2019t supply or manufacture ranitidine products in the U.S. or Canada, said Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the company. The company does supply ranitidine products in multiple markets in Europe that are made at sites in Italy and Spain, and via third-party manufacturers in Germany, according to Quinn.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Wong and Kristine Owram", "title": "GM strike in U.S. could lead to thousands of auto layoffs in Canada", "description": "Two of GM Canada's plants \u2014 Oshawa and St. Catharines \u2014 rely on parts from the U.S. and could see jobs being hit as early as this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/gm-strike-poised-to-affect-thousands-of-canadian-auto-jobs?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/strike.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 16, 2019 12:21 PM EDT", "content": "The labour strike at General Motors Co. in the U.S. could lead to thousands of layoffs in Canada as the ripple effects from the highly integrated auto industry spread from engine plants to parts makers such as Magna International Inc.The United Auto Workers\u2019 first strike against GM in 12 years began at midnight, with 46,000 employees staging a walk out. Two of GM Canada\u2019s plants \u2014 Oshawa and St. Catharines \u2014 rely on parts from the U.S. and could see jobs being hit as early as this week, said Jerry Dias, national president for Unifor, the Canadian union.\u201cThere will be temporary layoffs in all three facilities as the parts start to dry up,\u201d Dias said in a phone interview. \u201cIt could hit about a couple of thousand jobs.\u201d \nFifty thousand GM workers walk off the job in strike that could cost the automaker $50 million a day\n\u2018Heightened uncertainty\u2019: Magna and Linamar sales decelerate on weak global demand\nCanadian auto sales fall for 16th straight month \u2014 and even the reliable luxury segment is cooling off\nJennifer Wright, a spokeswoman for GM Canada, said there\u2019s been no impact on Canadian operations, but the company is monitoring the situation closely. GM Canada has about 5,700 hourly employees at three manufacturing plants in Ontario.About 2,200 workers at GM\u2019s Oshawa assembly plant build the Chevrolet Impala and models of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. At the St. Catharines engine and transmission operations, about 1,100 employees make V6 and V8 engines and GF6 transmissions. Those engines are shipped to about 10 different GM assembly plants across North America. The CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll builds the Chevrolet Equinox with about 2,400 employees.Parts MakersThe UAW is fighting over jobs and benefits, including better health care and the length of time it takes for shorter-tenured members to get top-scale pay. The strike could cost GM about US$50 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes due to lost production, Dan Levy, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Sunday. Shares in the Detroit-based company fell about 3 per cent on Monday.\u201cGM workers in the U.S. are mad as hell, just like GM workers in Canada,\u201d Dias said. \u201cFor way too long we\u2019ve been losing our jobs to Mexico where GM candidly exploits their employees. There\u2019s frustration with GM on both sides of the border.\u201dGM workers in the U.S. are mad as hell, just like GM workers in CanadaJerry Dias \n \nMagna along with Linamar Corp. and Martinrea International Inc. are among the largest suppliers to the North American auto industry. Magna gets about 15 per cent of its revenue from GM, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and is hoping that both sides will get back to the negotiating table.High Stakes\u201cWe remain hopeful for a quick resolution,\u201d Scott Worden, a spokesman for Aurora, Ontario-based Magna, said in an emailed statement. \u201cAlthough Magna supplies GM on a number of programs globally, it would be premature to comment on the potential impact to our operations right now.\u201dRob Wildeboer, co-founder and chairman of Vaughan, Ontario-based Martinrea, said in an email that any production affected would likely be made up later and Flavio Volpe, president of Canada\u2019s Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, is optimistic a resolution will come soon.\u201cOne day, two days, you can readjust your production schedules, you can bounce around your operations; three days, four days, it starts affecting people\u2019s shifts,\u201d Volpe said. \u201cThis is why we\u2019ll probably see a resolution today.

Wednesday\u2019s decision is a statement-only affair. The next day, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri will give a speech in Halifax to provide more details on the central bank\u2019s deliberations around the decision. \nExpect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by the end of the year: David Rosenberg\nCanada, U.S., UK, Australia and New Zealand only major bond markets now without negative rates \u2014 if they go, we\u2019re in trouble\nLook for a dovish Bank of Canada next week \u2014 with cuts coming soon, economists say\nSwaps trading suggests investors are fully pricing in a cut by December, with strong odds of a second by this time next year. Odds for a rate cut on Wednesday are less than 10 per cent.Even two cuts over the next 12 months would still leave Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies \u2014 raising the question of whether the domestic outlook truly justifies the northern nation\u2019s outlier status.While Canada\u2019s expansion is hardly remarkable, it stands out by virtue of having largely weathered the recent global slowdown. After a sluggish start to the year, growth in Canada accelerated to a strong 3.7 per cent annualized pace in the second quarter, giving it a very decent 2.1 per cent performance for the first half.Canada\u2019s housing market, meanwhile, is recovering; inflation is at target; and wage gains are accelerating. The Canadian data are hardly screaming rate cut.Nor are forecasts overly gloomy.Economists, including those at the central bank, continue to see growth averaging more than 1.5% in the foreseeable future, which outside of the U.S. is as good as it gets in the Group of Seven.Of course, the Bank of Canada could mark down its forecasts for exports and investment, and the second-quarter GDP numbers also raised concerns about the underlying strength of consumption. But without a global recession, the base case will continue to call for half-decent growth, tempering the need for rate cuts.Risk ManagementYet, the one thing Poloz has practiced as governor is a reluctance to put too much weight on base case projections. He adopted a risk management framework in 2013 \u2014 well before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2014 that essentially moved the focus away from pinpoint forecasts to thinking about what could produce unexpected deviations. It\u2019s a play-it-safe strategy.When conditions were calling for rates to go up, risk management took the form of hyper data dependency. Policy makers were worried that more expensive credit could trigger an unwanted downturn so they were willing to go slow with hikes, waiting for the data to reaffirm their analysis.Now, with downside risks at the forefront and conditions suggesting cuts are in order, waiting may no longer be the best type of risk management strategy. Which is why Poloz, in the middle of the oil price shock in 2015, cut interest rates at the time. He called it an insurance cut, much like Powell\u2019s rationale for the Fed\u2019s last move.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "What sewage screening suggests about cannabis use and the black market in Canada", "description": "When it comes to cannabis, the proof is in the peeing \u2014 and the results are surprising", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/cannabis-investing/sewage-screening-turns-up-surprising-pot-data-cannabis-weekly", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cannabis-smoking.jpg", "publishedAt": "September 3, 2019 9:27 AM EDT", "content": "When it comes to cannabis, the proof is in the peeing.Canada\u2019s national statistics agency has been collecting and testing municipal wastewater samples from five cities for traces of cannabis to gauge actual usage of the now legal drug. The results are surprising: In some cases they contradict other Statistics Canada data on pot use, while shedding light on the potential size of the black market.When cannabis is consumed, the body converts THC into THC-COOH, which can then be measured in wastewater \u2014 a nice word for sewage. Of the five cities measured between March 2018 and February 2019, Halifax, Nova Scotia had the highest average \u201cload\u201d of THC-COOH per capita, followed by Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. \n\u2018Just not selling\u2019: Canopy\u2019s results take hit as some retailers struggle to move oil and gel products\nCannTrust\u2019s fall from the top: The story of how a once $1-billion company stumbled so badly\n\u2018Growing outside is a dream\u2019: Asparagus makes way for cannabis in Canada\u2019s fields\nThe fact that Halifax residents are peeing out more cannabis residue than anyone else isn\u2019t surprising, as Statistics Canada\u2019s National Cannabis Survey found that 24 per cent of Nova Scotians reported using pot in the second quarter, the highest of any province.What\u2019s surprising is that Montreal\u2019s levels are so high, when only 10 per cent of Quebecers reported cannabis use in the second quarter, the lowest of any province. Edmonton\u2019s low wastewater results are also confounding, as Alberta had the third-highest reported cannabis use at 20 per cent.So are people lying or is wastewater an imperfect measure? It could be a bit of both. Statistics Canada acknowledges the difficulty of getting people to accurately divulge their pot use.\u201cThe stigma associated with use and reluctance to disclose purchases from non-regulated suppliers are two factors that could contribute to some under-reporting on surveys,\u201d it said in the wastewater report.In analyzing the Montreal wastewater data, the agency said factors beyond simple cannabis use per capita could be skewing the results. \u201cIt is possible that the consumption per user could be greater,\u201d according to the report. \u201cIt is also possible that cannabis use in Montreal is measurably higher than for the rest of Quebec.\u201dPot GDPThe cannabis sector contributed $8 billion to Canadian gross domestic product in June, up from $6.5 billion a year earlier. The numbers show a significant increase from April onward, signalling that Ontario\u2019s belated opening of retail stores had a notable impact on the pot industry\u2019s contribution to GDP. The sector is still one of the smallest tracked by Statistics Canada, trailing the $13 billion from the media and content industry.Legal sales are gaining ground on the illicit market. The size of the unlicensed cannabis industry shrank 26 per cent in the year through June, while licensed sales rose over fourfold, according to the data.Meanwhile, Health Canada reported that legal sales of dried cannabis increased by 4.7 per cent in June from May, while legal sales of cannabis oil fell 2.1 per cent. Interestingly, that decline was entirely from the medical market, where sales tumbled 18 per cent; recreational oil sales increased 19 per cent.This data conflicts with Canopy Growth Corp.\u2019s experience in the quarter ended June 30, when it took an $8 million revenue adjustment to reflect potential returns of oils and softgels due to oversupply in the recreational market. Meanwhile, 46 per cent of its medical sales came from oils and softgels, up from 17 per cent a year earlier.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji and Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "If you thought August was bad, get ready for the worst month for Canadian stocks", "description": "In the past 10 years, the TSX has dropped an average 1.5% in September", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/think-august-was-bad-here-comes-worst-month-for-canadian-stocks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/tsx2_np2-e1494531193469.jpeg", "publishedAt": "September 3, 2019 8:36 AM EDT", "content": "After enduring a bumpy ride in August, investors in Canadian stocks need to brace for more volatility in September, typically the worst month of the year for equities.In the past 10 years, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index has dropped an average 1.5 per cent in September, as the end of summer, return to school and the start of a heavy conference agenda seem to be a bad combination for equities.

The index has risen six of the last 10 Septembers, though massive declines in 2011, 2014 and 2015 pushed the average lower.Investors can be forgiven for wanting to see August behind them.

While most expect no rate change, Governor Stephen Poloz\u2019s comments on monetary policy will be watched closely, especially after GDP expanded 3.7 per cent in the second quarter, beating the 3 per cent estimate.

The rebound follows two straight quarters of hardly any growth. The period also ended better than expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.2 per cent in June.The underlying details, however, were less impressive. The rebound was driven by the fastest quarterly increase in exports since 2014, but growth in household consumption came to a near halt despite strong gains in incomes, and business investment shrank by the most in more than two years. As a result, domestic demand contracted in the second quarter. \nHow some Canadian multinational retail firms are finding ways to get around global trade chaos\n\u2018Where are we going to go?\u2019 U.S. soybeans flooding across border leaving Canadian farmers scrambling\nCanadian banks brace for tougher times as \u2018Goldilocks\u2019 era winds down\nThat could be a signal of growing unease among households and businesses about global economic conditions, fuelled by concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and potentially foreshadowing a sharper slowdown in the second half of the year. Policy makers at the Bank of Canada may look through some of the strength in the report.\u201cThis was a \u2018less than meets the eye\u2019 report,\u201d Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note to investors. \u201cNot only were today\u2019s details weak, but since the second quarter ended we\u2019ve seen yet another escalation in the trade wars and associated uncertainty.\u201dThis was a 'less than meets the eye' report Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank \n \nPossibly reflecting concerns about the outlook, businesses met some of the pickup in foreign demand by drawing down inventories, rather than boosting production. The strong gain in exports, meanwhile, is seen as only temporary, reflecting a ramping up of shipments after a sluggish winter. Exports had slumped sharply earlier this year because of curtailments on oil production and other temporary issues, prompting many businesses to stockpile.DePratto said he expects the Bank of Canada to join the global trend toward easing monetary policy in October, an increasingly likely scenario according to swaps trading. A second cut is being priced in by investors sometime next year. The next rate decision is Sept. 4, when policy makers aren\u2019t expected to move but will likely strike a more dovish tone. Friday\u2019s GDP numbers beat the bank\u2019s 2.3 per cent forecast, and economists had predicted a 3 per cent increase.The stronger-than-expected headline figure boosted the Canadian dollar. The loonie was up 0.2 per cent to $1.3255 per U.S. dollar at 10:04 a.m. in Toronto.\u2018Solid Increase\u2019Despite the worrying details, the Canadian economic expansion in the second quarter was still impressive \u2014 growing the most in two years at easily the fastest pace in the Group of Seven. The U.S. economy expanded by an annualized 2 per cent over the same period.Shipments by Canadian exporters rose at a 13 per cent pace, contributing more than 4 percentage points to growth.

Interest rates have reached a permanent low. U.S. stocks have reached a permanent high. FAANG stocks will rule markets for all time. Value investing is dead.During previous bouts, Warren Buffett, America\u2019s patron saint of investing offered his sage \u2014 and inevitably unpopular \u2014 perspective. When the dot-com mania raged in the late 1990s, he famously warned against chasing internet stocks. And during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he implored investors not to give up on U.S. stocks. Of course, neither episode turned out to be different from the innumerable ones that preceded it, at least when it comes to investing.This time, Buffett has been uncharacteristically missing from the chatter, but that doesn\u2019t mean his views are any less clear, or any less worth paying attention to. \nJust what is Warren Buffett getting up to in Europe?\nBill Ackman pays ultimate homage to idol Warren Buffett with $686-million bet on Berkshire Hathaway\nWarren Buffett admits he was an \u2019idiot\u2019 for not buying Amazon earlier as Berkshire acquires stake\nLet\u2019s start with Buffett\u2019s favourite stock market barometer, the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. As its name suggests, it measures the total value of the stock market as a percentage of GDP. In simple terms, a lower ratio is bullish and a higher one is bearish.The ratio was prescient during the last two downturns. It shot up to 146 per cent at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, a record at the time and well above its average of 89 per cent since 1975, according to numbers compiled by the World Bank. It peaked again at 137 per cent just before the financial crisis in 2007. Where is the market cap-to-GDP ratio now? It notched a fresh high of 154 per cent in 2017, according to the latest available number, and is almost certainly higher today given that the U.S. stock market is up roughly 7 per cent since the end of 2017.So it\u2019s probably safe to say that Buffett doesn\u2019t love the lofty level of the stock market. And judging by the record US$122 billion of cash he\u2019s hoarding at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it\u2019s also safe to assume he doesn\u2019t expect the market to remain elevated forever. Buffett\u2019s cash pile is more than half the value of Berkshire\u2019s US$208-billion portfolio of public companies, and since 1987 his cash allocation as a percentage of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio was only higher in the years leading up to the financial crisis.At the same time, the few stocks that do appeal to Buffett suggest his faith in value investing is unshaken despite a miserable decade of underperformance for the strategy. Roughly 45 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s stock portfolio is allocated to the financial sector, and eight of the portfolio\u2019s top 12 holdings are financial stocks \u2014 a deeply contrarian bet. The sector has been hampered for much of the last decade by tighter regulation and low interest rates. While profits have picked up recently, many investors fear that a prolonged period of low rates will keep a lid on profits for the foreseeable future.\n\nWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway attends the annual Berkshire shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, May 3, 2019.\n\nJOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs a result, the financial sector has been one of the cheapest sectors by most measures for years. It\u2019s still the most represented sector in many value indexes, including a 21 per cent allocation in the S&P 500 Value Index and 23 per cent in the Russell 1000 Value Index. That\u2019s apparently not enough for Buffett, whose allocation to the sector is double that.Much has been made of Buffett\u2019s uncharacteristic pivot to technology stocks in recent years, but that, too, is mostly a value play. Apple Inc. makes up nearly 90 per cent of Berkshire\u2019s 27 per cent allocation to the technology sector. When Buffett began buying Apple in early 2016, it was a bona fide value stock. It boasted an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, and an average price-to-cash flow ratio of 7.5 during the first quarter of that year, well below the S&P 500\u2019s P/E ratio of 19.5 and P/CF ratio of 10.9. Apple is pricier today, but it\u2019s still the largest name in the S&P 500 Value Index, with a hefty 8.3 per cent allocation.Buffett has said that he regrets passing on Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. when the companies were younger, but don\u2019t mistake the maestro. The fact that he isn\u2019t loading up on them today, despite having plenty of cash to do so, speaks volumes. Amazon trades at a jaw-dropping P/E ratio of 73 and Alphabet at 27, which is the furthest thing from value. Buffett already has a small 0.5 per cent allocation to Amazon on the recommendation of one of his deputies. Don\u2019t count on him making meaningfully more room for Amazon or Google at current prices.For now, Buffett is paying a price for his dissent.\u00a0 Berkshire\u2019s return trailed the S&P 500 by 0.9 percentage points a year from 2009 to 2018, including dividends. It\u2019s not the first time. Buffett lagged the market by 3.2 percentage points a year around the Nifty Fifty craze from 1971 to 1975 and by 6.1 percentage points a year during the dot-com boom from 1995 to 1999.Still, Berkshire\u2019s portfolio remains unabashedly Buffett: big profits at a reasonable cost. The portfolio has a weighted-average return on capital of 12 per cent, compared with just 7.9 per cent for the S&P 500. And it\u2019s far cheaper. Buffett\u2019s portfolio has a P/E ratio of 16.5, based on 12-month trailing operating earnings per share, compared with 21 for the S&P 500.There\u2019s little indication, in other words, that Buffett is wavering from his long-standing investing principles. It\u2019s a timely example, even if Buffett is no longer eager to say so.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Wake up\u00a0Canada: There's still plenty of news to watch for in the last days of summer", "description": "Four of the six major Canadian banks report fiscal third-quarter results, and economic growth figures for\u00a0Canada\u00a0are due Friday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/wake-up-canada-theres-still-plenty-of-news-to-watch-for-in-the-last-days-of-summer", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/long1111.jpg", "publishedAt": "August 26, 2019 8:52 AM EDT", "content": "We\u2019re heading into what might be the quietest week of the summer as the earnings season comes to a close and investors ease into the Labour Day long weekend.But there\u2019s still news to watch, as trade tensions escalate and four of the six major Canadian banks report fiscal third-quarter results.

The new sanctions \u201cwill be a further effort to ensure that their capacity not only to grow their economy but to evade sanctions becomes more and more difficult,\u201d Pompeo said.Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the new penalties won\u2019t force the country to negotiate or capitulate.\u201cAre there any other sanctions left for the U.S. to impose on Iran?\u201d ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Monday, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The Trump administration \u201cknows full well that if pressure and sanctions were the answer, they would have yielded results much earlier.\u201dIran\u2019s navy chief warned earlier that other drones would be downed if U.S. intrusions into Iranian airspace continue. The U.S. says the aircraft was in international airspace.The U.S. has applied sanctions to nearly 1,000 Iranian entities, including banks, individuals, ships and aircraft. In May, the Trump administration prohibited the purchase of Iranian iron, steel, aluminum and copper.The U.S. has also revoked waivers that had allowed eight countries including India and China to import Iranian oil despite American sanctions. Trump seeks to drive Iranian oil exports to zero to force Tehran to abandon support for militant groups in the Middle East and renegotiate the 2015 nuclear accord the U.S. quit a year ago. Observed crude flows from Iran dropped to 190,000 barrels a day in the first half of June, less than 10 per cent of the volume shipped in early 2018.Forecasts from earlier this year show Iran\u2019s GDP set to contract 6 per cent this year after declining 4 per cent in 2018.Exceptions to U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil sales will be made for humanitarian purchases such as for food and medicine, though it\u2019s not clear how those would be determined or approved.The U.S. Treasury Department has also sanctioned Iran\u2019s central bank governor and another senior official in the bank for allegedly providing support for terrorist activities.\u2018More Desperate\u2019The moves so far haven\u2019t been enough for at least one Republican lawmaker.

In Canada, you can\u2019t really say that.\u201dHere are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada \u2014 and one that shows why the country\u2019s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada\u2019s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s about as low as it gets, historically,\u201d said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn\u2019t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.\u201cIf there were to be a recession, whether it\u2019s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,\u201d Lascelles said in a separate webcast. \u201cThey just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.\u201dDebt-to-Income RatioCanada\u2019s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada\u2019s households are \u201csubstantially more leveraged\u201d than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.Debt Service RatioIn Canada, the debt service ratio \u2014 the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt \u2014 climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThat\u2019s a concern.\u201dBecause the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,\u201d Lascelles said. \u201cThe vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It\u2019s not whether you have a lot of debt, it\u2019s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada\u2019s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.\u201dIf the housing market implodes \u2014 which Lascelles isn\u2019t expecting \u2014 it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. \u201cAnd so to the extent we haven\u2019t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren\u2019t as many households that are vulnerable.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious there\u2019s a debt crisis in the making though. It\u2019s just one that\u2019s going to limit consumer spending and limit the economy more generally.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The Bank of Canada has learned a few things about targeting inflation, and it's sharing lessons with the Fed", "description": "The bar to change is high", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canadas-lessons-for-the-fed-bar-to-change-is-high", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "June 4, 2019 10:24 AM EDT", "content": "Don\u2019t bet on Federal Reserve officials to overhaul how they target inflation if the experience of counterparts at the Bank of Canada is anything to go by.As Fed policy makers meet in Chicago this week to debate whether to change their inflation target, they have been sharing notes with counterparts north of the border where mandate reviews have been regularly undertaken over the past two decades.The lesson they\u2019ll learn is that the bar to change is high.Every five years, the Bank of Canada reassesses its monetary policy guidelines, not unlike what the Fed is currently doing, including a conference this week on alternatives.

The underlying objective \u2014 to focus exclusively on price stability and use 2 per cent inflation as an operational guide \u2014 has been largely untouched.So why hasn\u2019t the case for change been more compelling?Officials at the Bank of Canada, whose next mandate renewal takes place in 2021, boil it down to a few things:\u2013 The system is not perfect, but the framework has been largely successful even with the recent difficulties in hitting the target. Price pressures and inflation expectations are stable, and economic cycles over the past two decades have been less volatile than has been historically the case.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Fed policy makers meet in Chicago this week to debate whether to change their inflation target.\n\nAl Drago/Bloomberg\n\n\u2013 One of the biggest benefits of inflation targeting is it\u2019s much easier to communicate, and for people to understand, than more complex approaches.\u2013 Perhaps more importantly is an acknowledgment that there is a false precision to the whole business of inflation targeting. Economics isn\u2019t an exact-enough science to really allow them to get it perfectly, which is why Canadian policy makers are happy to allow inflation to move within a range \u2014 1 per cent to 3 per cent \u2014 and would become worried only if they see a real risk of the band being breached. The 2 per cent \u201ctarget\u201d is simply the midpoint.\u201cFor now what we\u2019ve got is the inflation target and it\u2019s done a good job for us,\u201d is how Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz recently put it.On the idea of average inflation targeting being touted widely, for example, Poloz says it makes a lot of sense theoretically \u201cbut in practice, I\u2019d need to be persuaded myself.\u201d\u201cThe ability to let it cruise above 2 and know exactly when to prevent it from continuing on towards 3 is a lot harder than rocket science,\u201d said Poloz. It\u2019s \u201creally hard to pull off and risky on the upside.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean things won\u2019t change. Poloz and his main deputy overseeing the review, Carolyn Wilkins, seem to be open to new ideas, particularly given how monetary policy is becoming increasingly constrained by low interest rates and inflation. That\u2019s a world where the central bank has limited firepower to fight a recession, even as cheap money threatens to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis.As a result, the latest review underway at the Bank of Canada seems to be the most ambitious yet. Alternatives under consideration include raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate, targeting nominal GDP and even average inflation targeting.Yet, Canadian monetary policymakers are also quick to point out that there are limits to what central banks can do to solve all the economy\u2019s ills. Government policy too, they point out, has an important role, particularly in tackling structural issues.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canada's yield curve inverts the most in 12 years on Trump's Mexico tariffs threat", "description": "Investors are worried the tariffs will derail the revised NAFTA", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canadas-yield-curve-inverts-the-most-in-12-years-on-trumps-mexico-tariffs-threat?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/yield-curves.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 31, 2019 1:05 PM EDT", "content": "The yield curve on Canadian government bonds inverted the most since early 2007 as investors flocked to bonds on concern that Donald Trump\u2019s surprise threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports could derail the revised North American Free Trade Agreement.Canada\u2019s 10-year yields plunged to trade 17 basis points less than 3-month notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

One approach would return the portfolio to a composition similar to outstanding Treasury securities, while another would result in a shorter-term maturity structure of three years or less.Portfolio DiscussionThe staff analysis showed that a move to the shorter-term portfolio \u201cwould put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook,\u201d the minutes said.In their discussion of a portfolio proportional to the Treasury market, \u201cparticipants observed that moving to this target\u201d of portfolio composition \u201cwould not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks.\u201dSeveral participants judged that the proportional approach would be \u201cwell aligned with the committee\u2019s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy.\u201d At the same time, some of the debate focused on how much capacity each strategy would allow for adding economic stimulus through a maturity extension program.Investors have been betting the Fed will cut interest rates later this year partly on concern over inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, which prices have done for most of the last seven years.On the economic outlook, \u201cmany participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated,\u201d according to the minutes.GDP expanded at a 3.2 per cent annual pace in the first quarter,surpassing expectations, and unemployment hit a 49-year low in April.

That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months.The numbers may bolster hopes that growth is stabilizing after its recent soft patch. Trump, speaking with reporters before departing on a trip on Air Force One, said the GDP numbers were \u201cfar higher than the high expectations.\u201d \nBank of Canada could resume hikes if data proves slowdown temporary: Poloz\nSlump in world trade is just as bad as the decline sparked by the dotcom crash, warn analysts\nThe IMF cut Canada\u2019s growth outlook \u2014 but Deloitte says its forecast is still too optimistic\nBut underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers\u2019 2 per cent objective.Even so, the data showing faster growth and tame inflation helped push Treasury yields lower Friday. U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components \u2014 inventories and trade \u2014 that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed\u2019s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation\u2019s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a \u201cgreat number,\u201d consumer spending \u201chas to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. \u201cWe think it will, but it\u2019s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.\u201dWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cWhile this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker \u2014 namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.\u201d \u2014 Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can\u2019t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed MeetingFed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday\u2019s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final\u00a0sales\u00a0to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties.With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Shelly Hagan, Alyza Sebenius, Alister Bull and Justin SinkBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Foreign investments by pension funds protect Canada\u2019s triple-A credit rating", "description": "Since 2011, the value of Canada's overseas assets has more than doubled, says the global credit rating agency Fitch", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/overseas-shopping-spree-by-pension-funds-protects-canadas-aaa-rating", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/immig-canada.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2019 12:21 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s trove of overseas assets, including airports and roads owned by pension funds, is helping to protect the country\u2019s top credit rating, according to Fitch Ratings.Foreign assets held by Canadians reached $3.71 trillion US at the end of 2018, exceeding foreign liabilities by $528.6 billion US$ and making the country a net creditor to the rest of the world.That\u2019s helping to support the credit rating, despite a mountain of public-sector debt and persistent current account deficits that would typically undermine a nation\u2019s creditworthiness, Fitch said.

Nonetheless, \u201cCanada is building more external assets than external liabilities.\u201dCanada historically had been a debtor nation, with net liabilities peaking at $333 billion US in 2011, according to Statistics Canada. But since then, the country has seen the value of its foreign assets more than double, helped in part by a weaker Canadian dollar. That outpaced a 72 per cent increase in liabilities. The nation turned from debtor to creditor in 2014.The $2.2 trillion US economy is supporting public sector debt \u2014 provincial and federal \u2014 equivalent to almost 90 per cent of its output, compared with an average of about 40 per cent for the 11 countries rated AAA by Fitch. Top-rated countries have on average been reporting current account surpluses while Canada has posted deficits of about two percentage points to almost four percentage points of gross domestic product in the last decade.Pension FundsThose weaknesses would put the country\u2019s rating in the AA-range, were it not for a two-level uplift that Fitch applies to take into account issues including the net international investment position and unfunded pension commitments that are lower than its peers, wrote McCormack, who previously was a Bank of Canada official as well as a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni.Only Canada and Denmark are given that adjustment, said McCormack.Pension funds such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec are playing a key role in bolstering Canada\u2019s presence abroad.

He didn\u2019t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada\u2019s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term \u2014 unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada\u2019s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Positive ToneIn his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy\u2019s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to \u201cpositive growth\u201d later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will \u201ceventually be completed.\u201d Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials \u201cthey need to make new investments,\u201d aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.\u201cWe only have to look back a few years for an example,\u201d said Poloz, \u201cfollowing the oil price collapse of 2015.\u201dHe also cited \u201cnumerous advantages\u201d beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth \u2014 including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a \u201cportfolio\u201d of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials \u2014 after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector \u2014 can \u201csee many areas of encouraging economic growth\u201d in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.\u201cThese data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cJudging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s Stephen Poloz gets chance today to put rate cut speculation on ice", "description": "Investors now see a strong chance of a cut by the Bank of Canada over the next 12 months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/poloz-has-chance-with-arctic-speech-to-put-rate-cut-bets-on-ice", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/stephen-poloz.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 1, 2019 10:34 AM EDT", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has an opportunity Monday to address market expectations that his next move will probably be an interest-rate cut.Poloz speaks in Iqaluit, the capital of the northern territory of Nunavut, in his first appearance since the Federal Reserve\u2019s surprise dovish policy shift two weeks ago triggered concern about the state of the global economy. A segment of Canada\u2019s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time since 2007. Investors now see a strong chance of a cut by the Bank of Canada over the next 12 months.This raises a major challenge for Poloz, one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need \u2014 at least over time \u2014 for rates to move higher. Whether he shrugs off the latest market moves remains the big question ahead of the central bank\u2019s next decision on April 24. \nAs income pie shrinks, Ottawa and business talk past each other\nCanada\u2019s debt to GDP ratio: \u2018Nerve-racking to see debt servicing costs rising so quickly,\u2019 RBC economist says\n\u2018The yield curve is the best economist out there\u2019: What Canada\u2019s first inverted curve in 12 years tells us\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to be talking about cutting rates at this juncture,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. Poloz \u201ccould take one more turn of the dovish screw, I suppose, by going completely neutral \u2014 although I believe it would be more appropriate to do that at the next decision date. \u201dThe gap between Canadian three-month and 10-year rates went negative on March 21, tracking a similar move in the U.S. For investors predicting a recession south of the border, it wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched to assume Canada would be pulled into one as well. All of the country\u2019s last eight recessions have coincided with contractions in the U.S.Last StatementsThe Bank of Canada hasn\u2019t said much during the recent turbulence. Its last public communication was a March 14 speech by Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins in which she highlighted the vulnerabilities created by global leverage but said the central bank expects the worldwide expansion to continue and Canada\u2019s economic growth to pick up after a weaker-than-expected first half.Her comments reiterated language from the central bank\u2019s decision on March 6, when it left rates unchanged and toned down its conviction that interest rates need to go higher, while sticking to an overall hiking stance.Poloz\u2019s speech, titled the \u201cImportance of Trade,\u201d will be published at 2:55 p.m. Ottawa time. Iqaluit is situated 195 miles south of the Arctic Circle.Even as markets continue to bet on cuts, the data is mixed enough to keep Poloz on the sidelines for the foreseeable future. The latest gross domestic product data show the economy expanded at a 0.3 per cent pace in January, painting a less bleak picture than feared. Growth is tracking an annualized first-quarter pace of more than 1 per cent, a big improvement from the previous quarter\u2019s 0.4 per cent.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cThe Canadian expansion faces a host of challenges in 2019. Escalating global risks and weaker-than-expected GDP at year-end signal below-trend growth this year. This means inflationary pressures should be subdued, which will allow the Bank of Canada to pause on its path back to neutral to assess the changing landscape.\u201dThe Bank of Canada will release a new set of quarterly economic forecasts at its April meeting that will likely be revised down. In January, it forecast growth of 2 per cent in 2018 and 1.7 percent this year. The 2018 number came in at 1.8 per cent. Economists have since lowered estimates for 2019 closer to 1.5 per cent.Neutral RatePolicy makers will also use the April meeting to review their neutral interest rate forecast \u2014 a key variable for plotting decisions. The measure is used to gauge how stimulative the policy rate is: the bigger the gap between the actual rate and the neutral rate, the more stimulative the policy, while a smaller gap would indicate fewer hikes are required. A downward revision would imply current policy is tighter than previously assumed.Until now, the central bank has estimated the neutral rate is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Canada emerges from slump with best growth gain in eight months", "description": "The unexpected gain paints a much less bleak picture for an economy than we have been seeing lately", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-emerges-from-slump-with-best-gdp-gain-in-eight-months?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/pjt-canadian_flag-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 29, 2019 11:13 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s economy began 2019 with its largest output gain in eight months, an unexpected result that will ease worries the expansion has come to a halt.Gross domestic product grew by 0.3 per cent in January, faster than the 0.1 per cent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Since 1990, the Canadian agency has been using U.S. figures to calculate the nation\u2019s exports to its biggest trading partner.\u201cTrade statistics without Canada\u2019s exports to the U.S. have limited use as a current economic indicator, as these exports represent approximately 75 per cent of Canada\u2019s total exports,\u201d the Ottawa-based agency said on its website.The lack of merchandise trade data casts a fog over the state of the nation\u2019s economy, and raises the prospect of a prolonged delay handcuffing the Bank of Canada\u2019s ability to properly assess the economic outlook as it considers additional interest rate increases.\u201cWith more U.S. indicators being delayed \u2014 especially at the start of the year \u2014 it will become more difficult for the Bank of Canada to forecast where the economy and exports are headed in 2019,\u201d Dominique Lapointe, an economist with Laurentian Bank Securities Inc., said from Montreal.Policy makers, however, had been widely expected to remain on hold for at least the next few months.

The full text of the letter as it appears on Apple\u2019s website is below:To Apple investors:Today we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:Revenue of approximately US$84 billion Gross margin of approximately 38 per cent Operating expenses of approximately US$8.7 billion Other income/(expense) of approximately US$550 million Tax rate of approximately 16.5 per cent before discrete items. \nApple\u2019s warning says a lot about the global economy \u2014 and it\u2019s not good\nApple bombshell sends global investors to safe havens while \u2018flash crash\u2019 jolts currencies\nApple now says Q1 revenue drop will be up to 10% on weak holiday, China sales\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates.When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:First, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS\u00a0and iPhone XS\u00a0Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2013placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.Second, we knew the strong U.S. dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.Third, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.Fourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected.In addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated.These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both.Emerging Market ChallengesWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.China\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.Despite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.iPhoneLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.Many Positive Results in the December QuarterWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges.Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2013growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers.Also, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.Services generated over US$10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.Wearables grew by almost 50 per cent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.Finally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.Looking AheadOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately US$130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.As we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result.Most importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.We can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base.This is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.Expectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.That has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.TimBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Greg Quinn", "title": "The verdict is in: Canada's 2015 downturn amid shock oil collapse wasn't a recession", "description": "'It was an extremely close vote,' but C.D.

The discount on Western Canadian Select to U.S. benchmark prices widened to US$50 a barrel in October, which Notley says is costing Canada billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Private capital turned against him long before that.Ever since dozens of royals and business chiefs were detained in November 2017 as part of a declared crackdown on corruption, a growing number of rich Saudis have been trying to move money out of the kingdom or draw up plans to leave, according to interviews with more than 10 people familiar with the matter. They all spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive.Saudis who stayed put are mostly parking their cash instead of increasing investments, adding to the headwinds buffeting the biggest Arab economy. Khashoggi\u2019s killing has only intensified the trends, some of the people said.Penalty for cancelling Saudi arms contract \u2018in the billions,\u2019 Trudeau saysIn the shadow of a killing, Saudi Arabia\u2019s investment summit loses its swagger as scrutiny mountsSaudi crown prince\u2019s carefully managed rise hides dark sidePrince Mohammed\u2019s grip on power has survived Khashoggi\u2019s death at the hands of government agents in Istanbul. But losing the confidence of local elites could wreck his most fundamental reform. Saudi wealth is supposed to be building a private sector capable of replacing state oil revenue as the main engine of growth \u2014 not staying on the sidelines or trying to flee the country.Even worse, jitters among local capitalists have spread to their foreign counterparts, who are also largely shunning the prince\u2019s project. \u201cA lot of people are afraid of Saudi Arabia,\u201d veteran emerging-market investor Mark Mobius told Bloomberg TV.Watershed MomentThe crackdown, whose targets were detained in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton hotel, capped a series of steps that had hurt business confidence. Payments owed to contractors were held up, and in June 2017 the kingdom led an unprecedented boycott of neighbouring Qatar.\u201cDomestically, the Ritz arrests were a transformative development \u2014 economically and politically,\u201d said Hani Sabra, founder of Alef Advisory, a New York-based consultancy. They were the \u201ccrystallization of a process that had been building.\u201dOfficials say the arrests were necessary to level the playing field among investors and curb rampant corruption \u2014 an argument that resonates with many Saudis who often complained that the elite were above the rule of law. Some of the prince\u2019s supporters also say a short-term decline in investment is an acceptable price to pay for a fundamental overhaul that will help create a more transparent business community.The Saudi central bank, responding to Bloomberg questions, reiterated that the kingdom places \u201cno restrictions on transfers.\u201dBut the scale of the purge, which ensnared people like billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, has left many worried about appearing to be rushing for the exit. To secure their release, detainees agreed to pay settlements that totaled more than US$100 billion. Allegations of torture \u2014 denied by the government \u2014 and the lack of transparency over settlements made the operation look more like a shakedown.As a result, some Saudis who did subsequently take money out of the country used a web of companies to disguise their ownership, and avoided places with close ties to the kingdom. Many looked to Switzerland or funds elsewhere in Europe, investing in real-estate and private equity funds, some of the people said.\u201cIt would be stupid not to make contingency plans,\u201d one Saudi businessman said.One person involved in structuring international deals for Saudis said clients have been shying away from eye-catching purchases. Instead of buying a five-star hotel in London, for example, they would invest the same amount on warehouses in the north of England, the person said.\u2018Drawing Attention\u2019Money was leaving the country before the purge, partly because the economy slowed as authorities imposed austerity in response to low oil prices, said Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. If anything, capital flight probably declined due to the \u201cfear of drawing attention,\u201d he said.Total outflows are estimated to rise 13 per cent this year to US$90 billion, about 10 per cent of GDP, compared with 2017, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.But such aggregate figures include foreign investments by state institutions. There\u2019s no way to pinpoint how much private Saudi money has been trying to escape a country that\u2019s embarked on aggressive new policies at home and abroad. (On the same day they rounded up business leaders, Saudi authorities are also widely believed to have put Lebanon\u2019s visiting prime minister under effective house arrest.)The purge took place days after global executives attended the prince\u2019s flagship Future Investment Initiative conference at the Ritz-Carlton and lavished praise on his economic plans.After the arrests, some major banks lowered their forecast for loans to businesses, a key gauge of domestic demand. That quarter, private growth slowed sharply \u2014 even though oil prices were rebounding.Lagging investment from locals and foreigners, added to new taxes and fees on expats, has helped push unemployment to the highest in more than a decade.\u2018Off My Map\u2019In an interview the day after Khashoggi disappeared, Prince Mohammed said the jobless rate will start coming down next year. He also predicted a rebound in foreign investment \u2014 starting with a sizable non-oil deal to be announced at the FII conference later that month.But then the outcry over Khashoggi began to build, prompting bankers and executives to drop out and turning this year\u2019s event into a subdued affair.

It is time to conduct a thorough review of the alternatives,\u201d she said.Canada\u2019s economic Achilles heel: A mountain of household debtMortgage risks fading as Bank of Canada sees dramatic drop in highly indebted borrowersBanks\u2019 advice to Stephen Poloz: Consider Alberta\u2019s oil woes before plotting your next rate moveThe comments are the strongest indication yet that the central bank will seriously consider changes to a framework that came into effect in the early 1990s and requires the bank to narrowly focus on a single objective: to keep prices stable.2 Per CentOperationally, that means aiming for a 2 per cent inflation target over its so-called forecast horizon of about two years \u2014 though some flexibility has been built into the system.The inflation targeting framework and overall focus on price stability \u2014 which is widely followed in many advanced economies \u2014 has been faulted for helping to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis, and also proved to be insufficient in giving economies enough firepower to help recover from the recession.Wilkins pointed out the regime could be challenged in the future by the long-term trend of falling global rates, which means borrowing costs will remain low even after the central bank removes all its stimulus. That will give it less firepower in the event it needs to respond to an economic downturn.Low borrowing costs also mean the economy will continue to be exposed to \u201cbooom-bust\u201d financial cycles under inflation targeting, since it encourages households to take on debt.\u201cMy bottom line here is that although our inflation-targeting framework has served us very well, we should look for ways to improve it,\u201d Wilkins said.Three CriteriaThe Bank of Canada will use three criteria to assess alternatives: the objectives should be short-term stabilization and cyclical issues rather than long-term matters, they need to support the greater good and consider implications on things like income distribution and financial stability, and they need to be robust in bad times as well as good.Wilkins outlined some of the pros and cons of some alternatives: raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate and targeting nominal GDP.The central bank will also need to examine how to improve the clarity around its toolkit of unconventional policies, which will be needed regardless of what framework is in place, Wilkins said. Another question for policy makers, according to Wilkins, is what role is there for fiscal and macroprudential policies to help reduce the burden on monetary policy.\u2013With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com"}]
