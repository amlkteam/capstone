I was meant to fly back this month but my flight was cancelled due to the virus. I have been in quarantine for approximately 40 days. I did earn more than $5,000 in Canada in 2019 and I am a resident of Canada. Moreover, I was coming back to Canada for the purpose of finding work and I already had some interviews lined up. I called [Canada Revenue Agency] on the phone to ask and the young lady seemed confused and then finally told me that I am eligible for Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) but she didn\u2019t seem sure. \n Can you please let me know whether or not you think I am truly eligible for CERB? I fit all of the requirements except I got stuck in Italy during the time of the quarantine.

Second of all you must be a resident of Canada, so clearly, I think that you would be considered a resident of Canada for tax purposes. Thirdly, you have to have a minimum of $5,000 of employment income or self-employment income either in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to application to meet that criteria. \n Of course, the final criteria is that you must have stopped working and stopped earning employment or self-employment income as a direct result of COVID-19. Perhaps you were sick or you actually lost your job because your employer is basically no longer paying you as a result of COVID-19, or you\u2019re taking care of a family member perhaps with COVID but again, I think this particular scenario would be problematic because I\u2019m not sure if you actually lost your job, you don\u2019t have a job, you\u2019re not currently employed. \n The fact that you are looking for a job and you have some interviews right now, I\u2019m not sure you would meet the technical conditions of losing your job as a result of COVID-19 or are technically unable to work. \n These are rules of course that are open to interpretation so again you may want to just check to confirm with the CRA or Service Canada to see whether or not they believe you qualify. (April 30, 2020) \n Should I apply for CERB or CESB? \n Tabitha in Hamilton, Ont.: \n I am a 20-year-old student living in Hamilton, Ont. I work at a restaurant which is now limited to take-out orders only. I informed my employer that until I feel safe again working at their business, I will be taking a temporary leave. My reason for doing this is because my mother is immune compromised. She has diabetes and has recently been diagnosed with stage four cancer. Obviously, I am not wanting to put her life at risk by me interacting with the public at my job. My employers are very understanding of my situation, and had no issue with my temporary leave. \n I have recently learned that those who voluntarily leave their work are not eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). At this time, I have received two automatic CERB payments. I am unsure if I am eligible to receive CERB now and I am wondering if I should apply for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) once it becomes available. I\u2019m pretty sure I will qualify for the CESB, but I do not know if I can apply for it after already receiving two of the CERB payments. If I were to apply for the student benefit I would assume they would take the CERB payments back eventually; but if I am (unknowingly) eligible for CERB should I be risking it to apply for CESB? \n This whole situation is very confusing. As I am a student I have to think about the cost of tuition, books and living expenses beginning in September. I am concerned that because of my lack of hours this summer I will be unable to afford the things necessary for me to continue with my schooling. If you could provide any insight to this situation it would be greatly appreciated. (April 27, 2020) \n Jessica Moorhouse, financial counsellor and personal finance blogger for JessicaMoorhouse.com: \n This whole situation is very confusing, I agree! Let\u2019s dive into your first question about whether or not you are in fact eligible for CERB. You\u2019re correct that the criteria states that if you voluntarily quit your job you would become ineligible for the benefit (CERB). However, you did not quit your job, you are simply on temporary leave. \n On the government\u2019s website, it states that you do not need to be laid off to access CERB, and can be eligible if you are still attached to your company (which you are). However, you did voluntarily request a leave of absence, and I suspect the criteria is saying that if you weren\u2019t laid off from your job but your employer is no longer giving you shifts due to COVID-19, then you can get CERB. In your situation, it\u2019s less clear if you would be eligible. I\u2019m inclined to say you may not be. \n However, there is a new section on the government\u2019s question and answers page that does address your situation of feeling uncomfortable continuing to work because you have someone at home with a compromised immune system. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t give a simple yes or no answer and just re-iterates the original eligibility criteria (including that you cannot voluntarily quit your job) and suggests speaking with your employer about improving workplace safety. \n In terms of whether you should consider applying for CESB, since this benefit won\u2019t be available until May and there is still very limited information and criteria on it, I would personally wait until there is more information about it before deciding. Since it is a benefit for students who are ineligible for CERB, if you are eligible for CESB, that means you will have to repay both CERB payments (most likely when you file your taxes next year). (April 28, 2020) \n Is there a clawback clause with CERB? \n Aidan from Surrey, B.C.: \n I'm interested in learning if the CERB has a clawback clause. In my case, for example, I'm being offered a few hours of work per week, which would take me over the $1,000 level of monthly income but under $2000 I would get from CERB. If I go over $1000, do I lose CERB totally or does the system claw back the overage amount from my $2000 benefit, allowing me to make more than the $2000 per month through a combination of income and benefit? \n Sorry for the rambling, stressful times. Thanks so much! (April 23, 2020) \n Robyn Thompson, personal finance expert and president of Castlemark Wealth Management Inc.: \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Personal Finance\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1431699 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1431699', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1952564, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Is there a clawback clause with CERB? \n Robyn Thompson, personal finance expert and president of Castlemark Wealth Management Inc, talks about whether there's a clawback clause with CERB. \n \n When submitting your first claim for the CERB, it\u2019s important to understand you cannot have had more than $1,000 of employment income or self-employment income for 14 consecutive days or more during the four-week benefit period. Now for consecutive claims you cannot have more than $1,000 worth of income in the four-week benefit period. \n There is no such thing as a clawback provision, which means if you were to make say $1,500 from your employer, you would not be able to scale back the $500 to $1,000 and then apply for the CERB. Now on April 15, the government of Canada put proposed changes to the CERB which would allow more people to potentially qualify under the program. \n Specifically, these are people who make less than $1,000 a month; they could be students, part-time workers, perhaps contract workers, that need access to additional funds. Technically, they could earn up to $1,000 and then they could earn another $2,000 from the CERB if they qualify. The government of Canada continues to update eligibility requirements so check back on their website often to see if you qualify for the program at a different time. (April 29, 2020) \n Are negative interest rates likely? \n Bill in London, Ont.: \n Are negative interest rates even possible in Canada? How likely is it? Is it true that interest can be deducted from savings accounts?\u3000 (April 27, 2020) \n Marc Goldfried, chief investment officer and head of fixed income at Canoe Financial: \n The Bank of Canada\u2019s (BOC) main monetary policy tool is the \"overnight rate\". This rate is used to encourage or cool economic output and inflation. Lower rates encourage borrowing and expansion, while higher rates discourage borrowing and slow growth. Today it is at 0.25 per cent - the lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis. The BOC does have the ability to take that rate to negative territory similar to Japan and Europe. We believe there is a lower probability of this happening and that the Bank will look to use other tools to manage a greater slowdown than what is expected; however, it is possible. \n The rates that the government borrows at are known as the \"Government Bond and Treasury Bill Rates\". These tend to drop when there is slow growth and little inflation; and the opposite when growth is strong and inflation is picking up. They are live, actively traded and change minute by minute. Given the economic devastation that has occurred related to population containment because of COVID-19, there is very little in the way of higher inflation expectations. In that environment, we would expect government borrowing rates at most terms, to approach zero and potentially go negative.

request to skip a payment and are experiencing financial difficulties will receive a temporary lower annual interest rate of 10.99 per cent, the bank announced in a statement. \n For the 80,000 Canadians that have already received CIBC\u00a0credit\u00a0card relief, the temporary lower rate will be retroactively applied to March 15, the company said. \n \u201cWe know Canadians need help now to manage day to day expenses,\u201d Laura Dottori-Attanasio, senior executive vice-president, personal and business banking, said Friday. \n \u201cBy lowering rates, we want to help reduce stress

by 50 per cent for personal and small business clients receiving minimum payment deferrals for up to two months. \n A 50 per cent\u00a0credit\u00a0of their interest charges will be applicable upon completion of a financial review with a bank adviser. \n Clients already receiving minimum payment deferrals will also have interest charges cut in half with the difference in interest\u00a0credited to their account. \n \u201cClients are managing their spending as they adjust to new circumstances and, to help them, we have introduced several relief measures to support them in this very difficult time,\u201d said Neil McLaughlin, head of personal and commercial banking. \n He said about 80 per cent of clients don't pay\u00a0credit\u00a0card interest or have access to lower interest rate options like lines of\u00a0credit. \n \u201cBy reducing interest charges for clients who receive\u00a0credit\u00a0card minimum payment deferrals, we are now offering additional support during these challenging times.\u201d \n National Bank said it is reducing the impact of interest charges on\u00a0credit\u00a0cards\u00a0for clients who requested a deferral and who are most affected by this crisis. \n It will defer minimum monthly payments on National Bank Mastercards\u00a0by up to 90 days and temporarily reduce the annual interest rate on\u00a0credit\u00a0cards\u00a0to 10.9 per cent for all\u00a0credit\u00a0card holders granted a payment deferral. \n It is also helping with interest charges for those who defer mortgage payments and prioritizing calls starting next week to call centres for seniors 75 plus. \n \u201cIn the past few weeks, we've helped tens of thousands of clients by offering them relief measures, payment deferrals and valuable advice and support,\u201d said Lucie Blanchet, executive vice-president, personal banking and client experience. \n Scotiabank said it is also offering a range of relief measures, including minimum\u00a0credit\u00a0card payment deferral for up to three months. \n However, interest will continue to accrue on outstanding balances and will be payable once the deferral period is over, says a notice on its website. \n TD announced it would reduce\u00a0credit\u00a0card interest rates by 50 per cent for customers facing financial hardship. \n \u201cMost Canadians pay their\u00a0credit\u00a0card on time, but we know that right now some families are facing financial hardship and are in need of some additional relief,\u201d said Teri Currie, group head, personal banking. \n TD said customers directly affected by COVID-19 who need payment deferrals can apply online regarding mortgage payments,\u00a0credit\u00a0card payments, auto loan payments and business banking principal payments. \n The moves come as the big banks faced calls to lower interest rates on things like\u00a0credit\u00a0cards, which generally carry high interest rates compared with other types of borrowing, to help reduce the bills faced by Canadians. \n The banks announced more than two weeks ago that they would offer mortgage payment deferrals for Canadians who may be struggling due to COVID-19. \n They have also lowered their prime rates, which are used to set the amount charged for variable-rate mortgages and other variable-interest loans, as the Bank of Canada cut its key interest rate target. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg

That increase will mainly be made up of extra gilt purchases, but will also include corporate buying, and will be completed as soon as operationally possible. \n In a conference call with reporters following the decision, Bailey said it was right to act now, rather than waiting for data to show the impact of the virus. He said the BOE\u2019s actions reflected the unprecedented nature of the crisis, the pace of which was increasing very rapidly. The central bank still has more in the tank, he said. \n The pound extended gains after the announcement, rising as much as 1.6 per cent, before paring the advance to trade 0.4 per cent higher. At one stage on Wednesday, the currency tumbled as much as 5 per cent, dropping to the lowest since 1985. \n Bailey said that market moves had bordered on the disorderly in recent days and market pricing had been exacerbated by rumors of a London lockdown. Still, the BOE isn\u2019t in favor of closing markets, he said. \n Meanwhile gilts rallied, with two year yields dropping 15 basis points to 0.20 per cent. \n The BOE also announced it was increasing the size of its Term Funding\u00a0Scheme\u00a0targeted at smaller businesses. \n \n Lower Bound \n The central bank has previously indicated that 0.1 per cent is its effective lower bound for rates. While Bailey said Thursday that he\u2019s not in favor of negative rates and has indicated previously that the BOE wants to avoid having to cut rates below zero to protect the banking system, he also said he would never rule anything out. \n \u201cThe spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but temporary,\u201d the BOE said in the statement. \u201cThe role of the Bank of England is to help to meet the needs of U.K. businesses and households in dealing with the associated economic disruption.\u201d \n The Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favor of the latest surprise move. The BOE said it would start bond buying on March 20, when it intends to purchases 5.1 billion pounds of gilts. Buying will be at a \u201cmaterially\u201d faster pace than in the past, and the levels of purchases will vary based on\u00a0market conditions, it said. \n It\u2019s the latest in a string of emergency action from the BOE and its counterparts around the world, after Sunday night saw the bank\u00a0unite with five global counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines. The Fed also cut rates to near zero and restarted its on QE program. \n The European Central Bank launched an 750 billion euro (US$820 billion) pandemic emergency debt-buying program Wednesday. That came on top of 120 billion euros in additional asset purchases agreed last week alongside measures to pump more liquidity into the financial system and to subsidize long-term loans for banks. \n Officials around the world are\u00a0scrambling\u00a0to respond to the spread of the coranavirus, which is forcing countries to shutter business and restrict travel. The problem for central banks is that they have already used much of the already-limited monetary-policy arsenal to fight the financial crisis, and have thus far failed to assuage concern among investors. \n The BOE\u2019s latest action builds on a suite of measures from policy makers last week -- including a half point rate-cut to 0.25 per cent from 0.75 per cent and a new program to provide easy and cheap credit -- that came on a day of coordinated action with the U.K. Treasury. \n The government announced Tuesday that the BOE would provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper in an unlimited program which they aim to have operational by next week, a move Bailey said increases the BOE\u2019s policy space. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett says negative rates are puzzling, but not scary", "description": "Warren Buffett said the prospect of negative interest rates is a bit confusing.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/warren-buffett-says-negative-rates-are-puzzling-but-not-scary-1.1408219", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 18, 2020", "content": "Warren Buffett said the prospect of negative interest rates is a bit confusing. \n \u201cThey puzzle me, but they don\u2019t scare me,\u201d Buffett said in a Yahoo Finance interview when asked if negative rates frighten him. \n U.S. policy makers have been seeking to grapple with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with the Federal Reserve on Sunday cutting its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to near zero.

That left a clear role for fiscal policy to help cushion the blow. \n \u201cThe thing that fiscal policy, and really only fiscal policy can do, is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers, and we\u2019ve seen some of that so that\u2019s an important job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity. In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit.\u201d \n The Fed pulled out some of the biggest weapons in its arsenal. It\u2019s key rate is now zero to 0.25 per cent, matching the record low level it hit during the 2008 financial crisis and where it was held until December 2015. \n \n The central bank also announced several other actions, including letting banks borrow from the discount window for as long as 90 days and reducing reserve requirement ratios to zero\u00a0percent. In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines. Powell said that he did not think negative rates, which have been used in Europe and Japan, would be appropriate policy in the U.S. \n President Donald Trump, who as recently as Saturday\u00a0attacked\u00a0the Fed for not lowering rates faster and further, quickly expressed support for the move. \n Trump \u2018Very Happy\u2019 \n \u201cIt makes me very happy and I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big step and I\u2019m very happy they did it.\u201d \n Treasuries\u00a0surged\u00a0and U.S. equity futures tumbled at the start of another volatile week as investors responded to the rapidly escalating economic impact from the coronavirus and bet it will overwhelm the policy response. The Bank of Japan said it was bringing forward to Monday a meeting scheduled for later this week. \n The Fed\u2019s emergency action came as more and more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy is being hit hard by the virus. On Sunday alone, Ohio ordered all bars and restaurants closed indefinitely, Nike shuttered all its stores at least through March 27 and airlines announced drastic cuts to their international flight schedules. Businesses are instructing staff to work from home, and travel and entertainment are being particularly affected as people take steps to observe social distancing to avoid infection. \n As the fallout spreads across the economy, the risk of a recession is mounting. Goldman Sachs\u00a0slashed\u00a0its GDP forecasts on Sunday. It\u2019s now predicting zero growth in the first quarter and a five per cent\u00a0contraction in the second. \n Powell, who said he planned to do some telecommuting himself to set a good work-from-home example, told reporters on the call that the rate decision Sunday is in lieu of the Fed\u2019s regularly scheduled meeting this week, planned for Tuesday and Wednesday. \n No Dot Plot \n He also said that the quarterly forecasts that would have been released at that meeting had been scrapped in light of the current uncertainty caused by the virus and would probably next be updated in June. \n With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession. Stocks have already tumbled into a bear market. \n \u201cThe Fed had to make this move, and waiting would have been a grave mistake,\u201d said Michael Darda, market strategist at MKM Partners. \u201cThe problem is there is a tsunami coming and the Fed is likely to be overwhelmed by it, and the markets know that.\u201d \n The Fed said it will keep interest rates near zero \u201cuntil it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d \n The central bank acted the day before leaders from the Group of Seven nations, including Trump, are set to discuss their virus response on a teleconference. Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most. \n \n \u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said. \n To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least US$500 billion and of MBS by at least US$200 billion. \n Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75\u00a0per cent\u00a0range. \n What Bloomberg Economists Say \n \u201cThe fact that the Fed saw it as necessary to act with the meeting just three days away speaks to the urgency of the matter.

On Thursday it sought to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities -- a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis. \n \n The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move -- alone -- failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost three per cent. \n \u201cThe Fed\u2019s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they\u2019re really inventing new stuff,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. \n She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities. \n \u201cThis is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is.

The buffer will drop to 1 per cent, from its prior level of 2.25 per cent. \n The growing number of coronavirus cases globally, the shock to oil prices and volatility in financial markets have prompted fears that Canada will undergo an economic contraction in the second and third quarters of 2020. \n The emergency rate cut was not entirely unexpected on the heels of the Bank of Canada\u2019s\u00a0March meeting, where it lowered interest rates by half a percentage point for the first time in more than four years.

However, downside risks to the economy are now \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities from cheaper money, the governor said. \n In fact, he flipped the argument on its head -- as he had done in his last rate cut in 2015 -- arguing the move may actually improve financial stability. \n \u201cIndeed, declining consumer confidence would naturally lead to reduced activity in the housing market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market, rather than contribute to forth.\u201d \n In the decision Wednesday, officials said the virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some regions, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions.

However, economists say there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve, and the situation is dire enough to warrant additional help from Trudeau\u2019s government. \n \u201cWe need a little bit of fiscal stimulus as well to at least support the economy through what is likely to be a bit of a rough patch through the spring,\u201d Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. \u201cIt does make it more powerful if you\u2019ve got both oars pulling at the same time. That can reinforce the message and help support the economy.\u201d \n The virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some countries, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions, the Bank of Canada said, warning the situation could worsen. Trudeau and his finance minister, Bill Morneau, say they\u2019re\u00a0prepared to help\u00a0but have stopped short of firm commitments. \n \u201cWe are very mindful of the fact that an economic impact is certainly being\u00a0felt\u00a0in the global economy and is beginning to be\u00a0felt\u00a0in Canada, and that\u2019s one of the things we need to turn our attention to and turn our attention to quickly,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters Wednesday in Ottawa. \u201cI would just say on that, watch this space.\u201d \n Earlier Wednesday, Freeland\u00a0chaired\u00a0a meeting of a newly formed \u201ccabinet committee on the federal response to the coronavirus disease,\u201d which she said hasn\u2019t yet made any decisions on potential responses. \n \n \n \n RELATED  \n  Poloz set to speak on economy after Bank of Canada rate cut \n  Big Six banks slash prime lending rates in wake of Poloz's cut \n  Rate cut will add 'fuel to the fire' in Canada's housing markets, expert says \n \n \n \n Fiscal Tools \n Economists are speculating about what measures the government could take. \n The federal government appears to be taking the risk seriously, setting up a committee of ministers specifically focused on coronavirus, according to Rebekah Young, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. \u201cThe big question now is how well they target it,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \n Potential temporary and targeted tools include more generous sick leave benefits, ramping up child care payments or simply increasing transfers to provinces hardest hit by the crisis, she said. \n Government should focus on major urban areas where the impact could be magnified if the virus spreads, according to Stefane Marion, chief economist at National Bank of Canada. He recommended programs to help subsidize service-based industries that may need to temporarily shut down or send workers home. \n \u201cWe need to keep activity going in the large metropolitan areas in Canada -- that\u2019s key at this time,\u201d Marion said from Montreal. \n \n But the biggest challenge for Trudeau is political: His government is already projecting a budget gap near $30 billion this year, even before any new spending measures he promised during last fall\u2019s election. \n The Liberals, who are due to release a budget in coming weeks, have also pledged to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. Rolling out an aggressive fiscal stimulus package would mean casting that anchor aside, and wouldn\u2019t come without political cost for Trudeau. \n Much will depend on the extent of the slowdown. The base case among most economists is a temporary one, to just over 1% growth this year. In a $2.3 trillion economy, a stimulus package of about $5 billion could boost growth by a couple tenths of a percentage point. Along with the large dose of monetary stimulus just delivered by Poloz, that could be enough if the downturn is temporary. \n But if the world economy is headed to a recession, the federal government will need to take the response over from the central bank. Relying solely on lower rates could fuel financial stability risks in Canada, where household debt levels are among the world\u2019s highest. Aggressive cuts could also exhaust whatever ammunition the Bank of Canada has left. \n Fiscal stimulus targeted directly at individuals and companies is seen as a more precise tool. And it has the added benefit of boosting confidence, based on the perception the government is prepared to deploy its resources to support the economy. \n --With assistance from\u00a0Kait Bolongaro. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Nicole Gibillini", "title": "Rate cut will add 'fuel to the fire' in Canada's housing markets, expert says", "description": "The Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday will further fuel the country\u2019s housing markets, according to one expert.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/rate-cut-will-add-fuel-to-the-fire-in-canada-s-housing-markets-expert-says-1.1400173", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 4, 2020", "content": "The Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday will further fuel the country\u2019s housing markets, according to one expert. \n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an unexpected blockbuster year in the mortgage market \u2013 at least until and unless we see a serious breakdown in the economy, \u201d Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com, told BNN Bloomberg in a television interview. \u201cIf you start seeing unemployment tick half a point higher, then all bets are off on the mortgage outlook this year.\u201d \n \u201cBut for the foreseeable future, these unbelievably low rates are adding a lot of fuel to the fire in the housing market.\u201d \n Chartered banks typically follow the central bank\u2019s lead when it comes to adjusting their prime rate, albeit not always passing along the full benefit of cuts.

Canada\u2019s central bank has managed to hold rates steady for almost 16 months, resisting a global easing trend. Now, after the Fed made an emergency half-percentage point interest\u00a0rate cut\u00a0Tuesday morning, Poloz may have no choice but to join in. \n It\u2019s a dramatic change from a month ago, when the most likely scenario was that Poloz would be able to keep the benchmark rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent for the last few meetings before his term ends in June. Markets are now pricing 75 basis points of cuts by the time he steps down. \n \n Here are some of the reasons why he\u2019s seen cutting: \n With the Bank of Canada already owning the highest policy rate among advanced economies, it\u2019s unlikely it can resist the worldwide policy response to the fallout from the coronavirus and China\u2019s slowdown. Canada\u2019s outlier status on rates has already made its currency one of the best performing over the past 12 months, a luxury the nation can ill afford at a time when oil prices have fallen and its exports are slowing. \n Group-of-Seven Finance ministers and central bankers, speaking on a conference call Tuesday,\u00a0reaffirmed their commitment\u00a0to act to protect their economies, but stopped short of any specific action. A few hours later, the Fed delivered an emergency rate cut. The Australian and Malaysian central banks were the first in the world to lower rates Tuesday at their scheduled meetings before the Fed\u2019s emergency response. \n Pressure for the Bank of Canada to act is only increasing. As of 2:30 p.m. Toronto time, markets were pricing in a 66 per cent chance for a 50-basis-point cut. That\u2019s up substantially from the start of trading Tuesday, when markets expected just one full 25 basis point cut, and no more. \n Even before the spread of coronavirus, Canada\u2019s domestic fundamentals were looking weak. The economy ended last year on a\u00a0soft note, with the expansion stalling in the fourth quarter and economists predicting below potential growth to continue into the first half of this year. The country was also dealing with a made-in-Canada crisis as demonstrations by environmental and indigenous-rights activists crippled freight and passenger traffic across Canada for more than two weeks last month. \n With slack in the economy already on the rise, many economists had been predicting a rate cut would be needed at some point over the next year. Reflecting this deterioration, the Bank of Canada took a\u00a0dovish turn\u00a0in January, highlighting concerns about domestic weakness persisting. \n \n \n \n HAVE YOUR SAY  \n \n \n \n   \n What do you think the Bank of Canada should do Wednesday? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1399278 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_2': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Hold',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Cut quarter of a percentage point',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Cut half of a percentage point ',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n Terms of Trade \n While Canada hasn\u2019t had a large number of cases to contend with, its economy is expected to be hurt by what most expect will be a sharp markdown in global growth as a result of the virus. The slowdown comes as the nation\u2019s trade sector has already been struggling, with growth in exports last year falling to the lowest since 2009. \n The primary channel for Canada is through commodity prices. The Bank of Canada\u2019s commodity price index -- which tracks commodities produced in Canada and sold in world markets -- is down 7.6 per cent since the start of the year. World oil prices have fallen by almost a quarter since their 2020 highs. Western Canada Select, a type of crude that accounts for about half of country\u2019s oil exports, is down 16 per cent over that time. \n Like other countries, Canada will also see a hit to travel and tourism, along with supply chain disruptions, economists said. \n \u201cThat\u2019s enough for them to cut on its own \u2013 the terms of trade shock, the travel and tourism, the supply chain disruptions from not being able to source inputs from China,\u201d Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, said by telephone. \n What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say: \n \u201cFurther evidence of a protracted economic slowdown will drive the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by 50 bps at its March 4 meeting. Market volatility in response to the coronavirus adds urgency to a preexisting case for a policy rate adjustment.\u201d \n - Andrew Husby, Bloomberg Economics \n Reasons for Holding \n An interest rate cut this week would mark the first Bank of Canada action since October 2018, when it raised rates. A strong labor market and near-target inflation have given Poloz some reason not to cut. So did elevated household debt levels and a tight housing market. Another reason to hold off until April is that the decision comes without the broader analysis included in a Monetary Policy Report. The federal government budget, expected later this month, may also provide some additional stimulus that monetary policy makers would want to incorporate into their decision making. \n Still, the global economic threat from coronavirus is enough to offset any of the domestic reasons why the Bank of Canada may hold. \n \u201cThe rapid spread of COVID-19 globally, deterioration in financial conditions, steep drop in oil prices, not to mention continued transportation disruptions domestically are collectively too much for the Bank of Canada to ignore,\u201d wrote National Bank Financial economist Warren Lovely in a note. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Nicole Gibillini", "title": "Fed's emergency rate cut 'a necessary move': Rosenberg", "description": "The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s surprise move to cut interest rates by half of a percentage point Tuesday amid the rapid spread of COVID-19 was \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d according to David Rosenberg.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-s-emergency-rate-cut-a-necessary-move-rosenberg-1.1399425", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 3, 2020", "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s surprise move to cut interest rates by half of a percentage point Tuesday amid the rapid spread of COVID-19 was \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d according to David Rosenberg. \n \u201cIn some sense, it\u2019s a surprise in terms of the timing.

Headlines related to the coronavirus will determine whether these begin in March or April.\u201d \n -- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Andrew Husby \n In a public health emergency, lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility. \n Lawmakers are also working on a US$7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress. \n One lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis. \n \n \n \n What a 50bps Fed cut does: \r\n- offsets tightening of fin conditions \r\n- avoids spike in yields \r\n- stems FX strength \r\n- sort of helps refinancing activity, corp credit \n \r\nA fed cut DOES NOT \r\n- fix supply chain issues \r\n- support consumer demand if everyone is scared \r\n- cure the virus \r\n\u2014 Frances Donald (@francesdonald)  March 3, 2020 \n \n \n Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero. \n At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries -- known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen. \n The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps. \n Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \n The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden,\u201d Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes.

But Quadriga Asset Managers\u2019s Diego Parrilla says buyers should beware. \n \u201cThis could become a textbook bull trap: the market rallies, you think it\u2019s over, mommy and daddy are going to intervene,\u201d said Parrilla, referring to central banks and governments. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t really play out, it\u2019s game over.\u201d His US$250 million Quadriga Igneo fund surged about 10 per cent\u00a0last month. \n Buying the dip has been one of the most profitable trades over the past decade as central banks have repeatedly intervened and eased monetary policy. That\u2019s kept the longest bull-market rally on record humming and investors counting on even more stimulus should the virus threaten economic growth. Indeed, the Reserve Bank of Australia kicked off the expected global response on Tuesday with a quarter-point rate cut. \n \n This time around, the stimulus could prove impotent. Haidar Capital Management\u2019s Said Haidar expects the spread of the virus, which has so far infected more than 90,000 people and killed over 3,100, to drag out. Efforts to contain it are having a serious negative effect on economies around the globe and central banks\u2019 easing won\u2019t turn them around, he says. \n Investors have been \u201ctrained like monkeys to buy the dip,\u201d said New York-based Haidar, whose Jupiter Fund gained 7.8 per cent in February. \u201cIf you look back far enough, there were periods when buying the dips were a disaster and could be again this time.\u201d \n Haidar and Parrilla aren\u2019t alone in their warnings. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said last week that investors should look to protect their portfolios and resist the urge to buy the dip, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi said the drawdown in risky assets has further to go. \n Not everyone is taking heed: many hedge funds piled in last week as the market plunged into a correction. Their purchases got more frenetic than any time in more than two years on Thursday, when the S&P 500 dropped 4.4 per cent\u00a0according to data compiled by Morgan Stanley\u2019s unit that lends money and settles trades for hedge funds. \n Haidar\u2019s US$650 million hedge fund is now up almost 23 per cent\u00a0this year after a 31 per cent\u00a0gain in 2019, according to a letter to investors seen by Bloomberg. Madrid-based Parrilla\u2019s fund is up almost 20 per cent\u00a0in the first two months, he said. \n The two are emerging as some of the biggest winners in the old-fashioned macro trading world. Such traders shift through trends in global economies and geopolitics to bet on everything from currencies to interest rates to stock indexes.

Lower bond yields amid the virus have allowed Canadian banks to unveil mortgage specials and the government has tweaked its mortgage qualification rules. Meanwhile, markets have begun to price in an interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada to cushion the economic of virus as soon as Wednesday -- maybe even 50 basis points. \n \u201cAll of this is great news for housing and the mortgage market -- until and unless we see a huge spike in coronavirus cases in Canada and/or a big jump in unemployment,\u201d Robert McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com, said in an interview. \u201cLower rates are stimulative to housing.\u201d \n Home prices in some of Canada\u2019s largest cities have already been rebounding after the market slumped through 2018 and 2019. Shrinking supply in Toronto drove prices to their strongest gains in more than two years in January. Pasalis estimates that sales were more than 40 per cent\u00a0higher in February from a year ago. \n Yield Freefall \n \u201cWe\u2019re back to near all-time highs in some markets, and we\u2019re seeing prices ramp up and bidding wars in hot markets,\u201d McLister said. \u201cEveryone knows exactly what happens in the near term if mortgage rates plunge -- that\u2019s just more kerosene on the fire.\u201d \n Royal Bank of Canada cut some mortgage rates at the end of January and HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s Canadian division began offering a three-year fixed-rate mortgage special of 1.99 per cent\u00a0on Monday while lowering its five-year fixed rate for uninsured mortgages by 30 basis points to 2.49 per cent. \n \u201cThis freefall in yields has been stunning -- you don\u2019t see this often -- and it\u2019s now just starting to translate into meaningful discounting in mortgage rates,\u201d McLister said. \n Jonathan Bundle, head of mortgages and secured lending at HSBC Bank Canada, anticipates more competition on mortgages ahead. \n \u201cThere\u2019s indication that it\u2019ll be a strong property market this year and because of that you are going to see that a lot of lenders will end up being competitive,\u201d he said. \n Vancouver Affected \n Still, some realtors have reported some early impacts on activity in cities like Vancouver as the coronavirus outbreak in China cut travel demand in the first two months of the year. \n \u201cSince they\u2019re not coming here for vacation for Chinese New Year, it\u2019s pretty hard for them to make a decision on any property,\u201d Vancouver realtor Jerry Huang said in an interview. \u201cPeople were planning to do open houses early February and obviously the turnout wasn\u2019t as good because there\u2019s just a lot less traffic.\u201d \n He estimated a drop of \u201c50 per cent\u00a0plus\u201d of overseas buyers, especially from Asia, who were going to visit Vancouver for real-estate projects and deals that just didn\u2019t come. \n Kevin Wang, real estate adviser and property manager at W Brothers Real Estate Group in Vancouver, said longer term, buyers from China may have more of an incentive to buy in Canada to avoid future virus outbreaks. \n Neither Ratespy\u2019s McLister nor Realosophy\u2019s Pasalis see the coronavirus as playing a big role in the coming months for housing demand, noting that Toronto\u2019s SARS outbreak 17 years ago failed to dampen sales. \n \u201cThe market is so far out of balance that you could lose half the sales and it\u2019d still be really, really

An expected narrowing of the rate differential between the RBA and the Federal Reserve, where markets expect three cuts this year, was a likely driver of the bounce. \n Lowe is a reluctant cutter. As recently as last month he said that balancing all the risks in the economy favored staying still. This stance was jettisoned following the shutdown in China that\u2019s hit Australia\u2019s tourism and education industries and other exporters. The virus\u2019s spread now poses a worldwide risk. \n \u201cPolicy measures have been announced in several countries, including China, which will help support growth,\u201d Lowe said in the statement. \u201cIn most economies, including the\u00a0United States, there is an expectation of further monetary stimulus over coming months.\u201d \n \n Global policy makers have sought to reassure markets they are ready to respond to the epidemic as fears mount that the world economy is heading toward recession. The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank said they stood ready to help member nations, while Group of Seven finance ministers and monetary officials will speak by teleconference Tuesday. \n \u201cThe coronavirus has clouded the near-term outlook for the global economy and means that global growth in the first half of 2020 will be lower,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIt is too early to tell how persistent the effects of the coronavirus will be and at what point the global economy will return to an improving path.\u201d \n In this case, though, Australia\u2019s central bank isn\u2019t going to have to face the downturn alone, with fiscal support in prospect. \n \u201cThe Australian government has also indicated that it will assist areas of the economy most affected by the coronavirus,\u201d Lowe said. Before the RBA meeting, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Treasury is working closely together with the other agencies \u201cto address the boost that we believe will be necessary.\u201d \n Morrison urged major banks to pass on any RBA cut. The four top lenders have all since confirmed that mortgage rates will be reduced by the full amount. \n The RBA now has only one 25 basis-point cut left in the locker before it reaches its effective lower bound of 0.25%. Lowe will find himself dragged toward quantitative easing, should the economy need further monetary stimulus. \n What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say \n \u201cThe Reserve Bank has fired the starter\u2019s gun on a widely-anticipated round of coordinated central bank easing. Further cuts were flagged, alongside a package of fiscal support. Risks now lie with the RBA utilizing unconventional monetary policy tools, particularly if there are dislocations in domestic credit markets.\u201d \n James McIntyre, economist \n Lowe said the RBA will ensure that the Australian financial system has sufficient liquidity. \n Yet even before wildfires and the virus, Australia\u2019s economy wasn\u2019t particularly strong. Gross domestic product probably rose 0.4 per cent\u00a0in the final three months of 2019 from the prior quarter, and two per cent from a year earlier, economists estimated ahead of data Wednesday. \n \u201cGDP growth in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier expected,\u201d Lowe said, having removed any 2020 forecast from the statement. \u201cOnce the coronavirus is contained, the Australian economy is expected to return to an improving trend.\u201d \n One area helping Lowe is the currency, the economy\u2019s traditional shock absorber that has depreciated almost seven per cent since the start of the year. China\u2019s fiscal and monetary stimulus will also assist in time. \n - -With assistance from\u00a0Tomoko Sato. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Shane McNeil", "title": "'It uses up bullets': Heyman warns central banks not to move too fast", "description": "Central banks may be getting ahead of themselves if they cut interest rates to quell coronavirus fears, according to a former U.S. envoy to Canada.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/it-uses-up-bullets-heyman-warns-central-banks-not-to-move-too-fast-1.1398956", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 2, 2020", "content": "Central banks may be getting ahead of themselves if they cut interest rates to quell coronavirus fears, according to a former U.S. envoy to Canada. \n \u201cIt uses up bullets that you may want to use in the future, where they might have more impact later,\u201d Bruce Heyman, the former U.S. ambassador to Canada, told BNN Bloomberg in an interview on Monday. \n Heyman \u2013 whose ambassadorial tenure lasted for nearly three years under former U.S. president Barack Obama \u2013 said while cuts may benefit some investors, it would not have the kind of broad impact that the central banks may be intending. \n \u201cThere are plenty of people who will look for the ability to refinance mortgages or carry credit card debt, or other types of debt that are floating and [they] will benefit from this,\u201d Heyman said. \u201cBut, for the most part, I don\u2019t think it will have the same stimulative effect that it would have under normal circumstances.\u201d \n Heyman, who also served as a vice-president at Goldman Sachs from 1985 to 1999,\u00a0added that the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, will run into difficulties in regards to its own balance sheet and its ability to prevent panic among those its moves are designed to help. \n \u201cThe balance sheet\u2019s kind of full, the rates are fairly low, and then if you look on the fiscal side (in the U.S.) we\u2019re running huge deficits now, at this part of the cycle.

At Bank of America, economists say \u201can emergency cut\u201d is possible by that scheduled gathering. \n Such a move would be rare, yet not unprecedented. Here\u2019s a brief history of when Fed officials have convened by conference call and delivered an inter-meeting shift to monetary policy: \n Oct. 8, 2008 \n As the September collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled financial markets and raised recession fears, the Fed cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent\u00a0as part of a coordinated action. \n \u201cThe Committee took this action in light of evidence pointing to a weakening of economic activity and a reduction in inflationary pressures,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said. It would go on to ultimately cut its main rate as low as 0.25 per cent. \n Jan. 22, 2008 \n The Fed cut its key rate by 75 basis points to 3.5 per cent\u00a0after stock markets tumbled amid increasing signs of a U.S. recession. \n Policy makers said in a statement that they acted \u201cin view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.\u201d \n Aug. 17, 2007 \n The Fed lowered its discount rate -- the rate it charges banks -- by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent as the subprime-mortgage collapse continued to roil financial markets. \n \u201cThe Federal Reserve is providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets,\u201d the\u00a0statement said. \n Sept. 17, 2001 \n Days after the 9/11 attacks, the Fed cut its main rate by 50 basis points to 3 per cent\u00a0and promised to provide markets with \u201cunusually large volumes of liquidity.\u201d \n Central banks in Europe and Canada matched the action. \n April 18, 2001 \n Policy makers cut their benchmark interest rate a half-percentage point in an effort to shore up a slumping economy. It lowered its target rate for overnight loans between banks to 4.5 per cent\u00a0from 5 per cent. \n The Fed \u201chas reviewed prospects for the economy in light of the information that has become available since its March meeting,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. \n Jan. 3, 2001 \n With the technology stock bubble having burst the previous year, the central bank began a new year cutting its benchmark by 50 basis points to 6 per cent. It was quite a shift from a few weeks earlier when the Fed had said the economic risks leaned\u00a0towards\u00a0inflation. \n \u201cThese actions were taken in light of further weakening of sales and production, and in the context of lower consumer confidence, tight conditions in some segments of financial markets, and high energy prices sapping household and business purchasing power,\u201d officials said. \n Oct. 15, 1998 \n As Russia\u2019s financial crisis and the collapse of Long Term Capital Management threatened a credit crunch, the Fed cut by 25 basis points to 5 per cent. \n \u201cGrowing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining aggregate demand in the future,\u201d it said. \n April 18, 1994 \n The Fed can also hike rates outside of its normal schedule. That\u2019s what happened here when it increased its rate to 3.75 per cent\u00a0from 3.5 per cent. \n \u201cChairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Reserve will increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions,\u201d the\u00a0statement said. \u201cThis action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Coronavirus rate cut could open Poloz's finale at Bank of Canada", "description": "Governor Stephen Poloz is poised for a dramatic farewell at the Bank of Canada before his departure in June.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coronavirus-rate-cut-could-open-poloz-s-finale-at-bank-of-canada-1.1398595", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Mar 2, 2020", "content": "Governor Stephen Poloz is poised for a dramatic farewell at the Bank of Canada before his departure in June. \n The central banker and his governing council decide Wednesday whether a cut to interest rates is warranted amid mounting concern about the global spread of the coronavirus. Canada\u2019s already fragile economy essentially stalled in the final quarter of last year, and the virus adds to a growing list of impediments that could push Poloz into his first reduction of borrowing costs since mid-2015. \n Canada -- unlike its Group of Seven peers -- has resisted the worldwide trend to easier monetary policy, but that resistance looks to be fading fast. Bets on a cut this week spiked as the economic fallout from the virus widened and stocks slumped. \n The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have now opened the door to further easing, and the Bank of Canada could decide to lead the charge. Economists at Goldman Sachs Inc. said Sunday a co-ordinated global monetary response might be in order. \n \u201cWith markets extrapolating what looked like a modest hit to global growth from the coronavirus into a full-fledged economic downturn, the bank is likely to want to lean against any deterioration in confidence,\u201d Dawn Desjardins, deputy chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note to clients Friday. \u201cThere is even the possibility of a coordinated central bank easing in the days ahead.\u201d \n \n Mounting Odds \n Investors are placing 80 per cent\u00a0odds of a cut on Wednesday, in a decision due at 10 a.m. in Ottawa. That\u2019s a sudden change from a week ago when markets were placing just a 20 per cent bet on Poloz easing, and economists have been slower to adjust their predictions. \n All but nine of 26 respondents in a Bloomberg economist survey predict the bank will hold rates steady this week. However, some shops including Royal Bank and National Bank Financial flipped their forecasts to a cut late last week, and others may follow. Futures markets are now pricing in two rate cuts spread over the final three decisions of Poloz\u2019s tenure. \n The Bank of Canada has kept its benchmark rate at 1.75 per cent\u00a0for ten consecutive meetings, leaving the country with the tightest monetary policy among advanced economies. Poloz seemed comfortable with a wait-and-see stance throughout 2019, largely due to a robust labor market and inflation near target. However, communications shifted in January to a more dovish stance as incoming data pointed to softer conditions. \n Now risks are piling up. The weakened Canadian economy must contend not only with the coronavirus, but also multiple pipeline protests that had ground rail transport to a halt, neither of which have been accounted for in the data. Analysts have already begun to lower growth expectations for 2020. \n For Poloz, whose commitment to data dependency has become a hallmark of his tenure, a decision to cut rates this week would mean acting before multiple risks materialize. Still, getting ahead of impending economic shocks isn\u2019t out of character. \n In his first policy move, Poloz unexpectedly cut rates in January 2015 to counter the impact of collapsing oil prices. And in last October\u2019s rate decision, it was revealed governing council discussed and subsequently dismissed the need for an insurance cut that would get ahead of the impacts of rising trade tensions. \n One reason policy makers may forgo a cut Wednesday is that the decision comes without the broader analysis included in a Monetary Policy Report. The central bank under Poloz has only moved the interest rate once in a non-MPR meeting, in September 2017. \n Still, Poloz is due to speak on Thursday at 1 p.m. in Toronto, and could take the opportunity to elaborate on the central bank\u2019s thinking. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: Former Fed official calls for coordinated rate cuts; big bank earnings wrap", "description": "Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-former-fed-official-calls-for-coordinated-rate-cuts-big-bank-earnings-wrap-1.1396714", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Feb 27, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n There was another round of heavy selling pressure in early North American trading as stocks tumble from all-time highs amid coronavirus fears.

U.S.\u00a0trade and investment were poised to accelerate this year after a series of new trade accords. but a sudden stop is a clear and present risk to U.S. economic prospects.\u201d \n WRAPPING UP BIG SIX EARNINGS \n Let there be no doubt that capital markets was the story in first-quarter earnings season for Canada\u2019s banks. TD put an exclamation mark on that trend this morning as its wholesale division swung to a profit after reporting a surprise loss in that unit a year ago. From there, it was a little choppier for Toronto-Dominion as adjusted profit slipped in its Canadian and U.S. retail banking divisions. Overall, TD\u2019s profit fell a couple cents short of the average estimate but the bank is adding five cents to its quarterly dividend. National Bank of Canada, meanwhile, exceeded profit expectations on growth in most its units \u2013 although its gains in capital markets trailed its peers (at 10 per cent compared to 30 per cent+ by the others). \n BLOCKADE WATCH \n Truly frightening images surfaced yesterday of protestors interfering with rail traffic near Belleville, Ont. -- \u00a0making it crystal clear that tension is still running high. Transport Minister Marc Garneau described the action as \u201creckless\u201d and also warned it could take weeks, or more, for rail service to return to normal after all the blockades come down. After mass confusion yesterday, it appears as though a crucial meeting between Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs and government officials from B.C. and the feds will finally take place this afternoon. \u00a0 \n BUDGET DAY IN ALBERTA (AGAIN) \n Less than four months since tabling its first budget, Alberta's United Conservative Party government is back with its second detailed fiscal plan this afternoon. The tone was set in a throne speech earlier this week, when Jason Kenney\u2019s government plainly stated, \"We cannot continue to spend more for less while going deeper into debt.\" Cost-management will be a theme to watch, as will expectations for revenue from the province's resource wealth. We're extending The Close today for special coverage when the budget is tabled a little after 5p ET. Watch for Tara's reporting on location in Edmonton. And keep in mind the last Alberta budget mapped out a plan for a modest surplus ($600 million) in 2022-23. \n OTHER NOTABLE STORIES \n -Microsoft is one of the last corporate giants to warn on the virus\u2019s impact, warning late yesterday that it\u2019s likely not going to hit a recent sales forecast for its More Personal Computing unit because of supply chain problems. \n -We\u2019re on fake meat watch today in a grab bag of earnings on the agenda. Already, Maple Leaf Foods reported a 31.5% sales surge in its Plant Protein Group and CEO Michael McCain said \u201cdisciplined investments in advertising and marketing\u201d for that business are taking hold. Overall adjusted profit, however, slid 58.6% and missed analyst expectations. Later today, we\u2019re expecting earnings from industry giant Beyond Meat. \n -Husky Energy reported a sharp drop in fourth-quarter funds from operations due to unfavourable pricing and a shutdown at a key refinery.

If inflation is seen at around 2% in two years time, that suggests officials endorse current market pricing that sees a rate cut as coming -- at least by August if not immediately. The outlook for GDP could tip the balance. \n Equally important will be whether the MPC keeps, tweaks or drops its view that \u201climited and gradual\u201d rate hikes are coming. \n Surveys -- the most up-to-date view of the economy -- suggest that confidence is roaring back now that Johnson has a solid mandate to push through the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union and ramp up spending.

A Lloyds\u2019s measure of business sentiment published Thursday indicates economic optimism jumped to an 18-month high. \n Hard data, much of which dates back to before the election, has been less impressive. Inflation is the weakest in three years, and British consumers shunned stores during the December holiday period.

Still, the jobs market has remained robust. \n The bank will also publish its updated assumptions about the economy\u2019s productive capacity.

Negative rates are \u201cnot a good place to be,\u201d lamented Kees van Dijkhuizen, head of Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank NV. His counterpart at Deutsche Bank AG, Christian Sewing, was even more direct, saying the ECB \u201cmissed the exit\u201d when growth was stronger. \n \n The calls for an end to the experiment are growing louder as the costs for banks mount and the fear of negative rates on retail deposits has local politicians up in arms. The ECB\u2019s goal is to revive the economy and inflation by forcing holders of excess cash to invest or spend it, but the side effects have left lenders falling far behind their peers on Wall Street. The policy is also widening rifts between wealthy investors who benefit from cheap money, and those who are seeing retirement savings melt, Sewing said. \n Christine Lagarde, the new ECB President, seeks to modernize the institution by reviewing its inflation goal, studying alternative measures of price growth, and assessing its policy tools. But economists surveyed by Bloomberg don\u2019t see an increase in rates before the first quarter of 2022. That means the mountain of charges banks have already paid to deposit money at the ECB will continue to grow. \n \n Euro-area banks have paid 25 billion euros (US$28 billion) to deposit funds at their central bank since June 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Societe Generale SA Chairman Lorenzo Bini Smaghi has called those charges a \u201ctax\u201d that hurts bank profitability because lenders are limited as to how much of it they can pass on to clients. There\u2019s still a benefit though: ECB estimates show that without its wider policy actions, euro area real GDP would have been as much as 2.7 percentage points lower at the end of 2018. \n The ECB isn\u2019t too concerned with bank profits, but it does want to ensure they keep lending. That\u2019s why it offered lenders partial relief from its negative rates last year by exempting some of banks\u2019 holdings of excess liquidity from the deposit charges. Still, the banks complained that the benefit was largely offset because the ECB also pushed interest rates further below zero. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult in Europe and the Netherlands to cope with that,\u201d said van Dijkhuizen. \u201cQuite a headache.\u201d \n \n Some European banks are hit harder by the negative rates. German lenders, which sit on a mountain of deposits, are especially critical. The ECB\u2019s review of its monetary policy is \u201cimperative because the risks and side effects are becoming ever clearer,\u201d Christian Ossig, co-chief executive of the Association of German Banks, told reporters in Frankfurt last week. \u201cThe side effects of negative rates call into question the efficiency of monetary policy.

She says this decision signals deepening concerns over the state of the economy.  \n \n Heightened Concern \n At its decision Wednesday, which kept rates steady for a 10th straight decision, the Bank of Canada expressed heightened concern about an economy that may have stalled in the fourth quarter. Policy makers revised near-term growth projections and expressed concern global weakness may be spreading to households, affecting domestic spending more than thought. They also seem to be entertaining the idea that underlying factors may be behind the slowdown, rather than temporary drivers. \n It\u2019s a change in tone that reflects a shift in growth risks in recent months from global to domestic. Three months ago, the central bank was highlighting the nation\u2019s resiliency to elevated international risks. Snce then domestic economic concerns have come to the forefront. \n \u201cIn determining the future path for the Bank\u2019s policy interest rate, Governing Council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast,\u201d policy makers said in the rate statement. \u201cIn assessing incoming data, the Bank will be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market, and business investment.\u201d \n \n The near-term slowdown coupled with a slight upward revision to potential growth prompted the central bank to increase its estimate for the amount of slack in the economy -- from about 0.25% of output in the third quarter to about 0.75 per cent. The bank also projected the economy will be in a state of excess capacity through the end of 2021. That build up in slack -- which bolsters the case for a rate cut -- is being weighed against the possibility that lower interest rates will fuel financial vulnerabilities, Poloz said at the press conference. \n All things considered, \u201cit was Governing Council\u2019s view that the balance of risks does not warrant lower interest rates at this time,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cClearly, this balance can change over time as the data evolve.\u201d \n The bank has been here before. In October, officials acknowledged they considered an \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cut to counter growing risks associated with global trade tensions, ultimately deciding against it. Poloz indicated the motives for a future move would now be different. \n \u2018Meaningful Shortfall\u2019 \n If the bank cuts in the future, \u201cit would not be a cut against a hypothetical or a possibility\u201d rather it would mean that the forecast was showing a \u201cmeaningful shortfall on our inflation target,\u201d he said. \n Even while cutting near-term forecasts, long-term estimates for growth were mostly unchanged from October, with a slightly lower growth forecast in 2020 of 1.6 per cent, but 2021 faster than previously forecast at two per cent. \n This suggests the base case scenario at the bank remains that the slowdown that began in the second half of last year will be temporary. The Bank of Canada anticipates that over the next two years household spending will pick up, helped in part by a recent tax cut, as will exports and business investment. It also anticipates inflation will stay around the \u00a0target over the projection horizon. \n --With assistance from\u00a0Shelly Hagan. \n \n \n \n WEIGH IN  \n \n \n \n   \n Should household debt levels prevent the Bank of Canada from cutting rates? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1377981 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Yes',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'No',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Stephen Poloz enters home stretch hawkish on rates", "description": "Stephen Poloz is heading into the final few months of his term as Bank of Canada governor showing few signs of giving up his status as one of the industrialized world\u2019s most hawkish central bankers.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/stephen-poloz-enters-home-stretch-hawkish-on-rates-1.1377252", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Jan 21, 2020", "content": "Stephen Poloz is heading into the final few months of his term as Bank of Canada governor showing few signs of giving up his status as one of the industrialized world\u2019s most hawkish central bankers. \n At a decision Wednesday, the bank is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 1.75 per cent, keeping it unchanged for a 10th-straight meeting and leaving Canada with the highest rate among advanced economies. \n Markets also don\u2019t see much chance that Poloz, who leaves office in June, will lower borrowing costs in any of his final three meetings after this one, with odds of a cut at less than 40 per cent\u00a0over that time. That\u2019s despite having reason to cut, given the economy looks to have slowed sharply at the end of last year. \n Here are some of the reasons why he\u2019s seen remaining on hold: \n \n Neutral Tone \n In public appearances since October, officials have sought to accentuate the positive, highlighting the nation\u2019s strong jobs market and on-target inflation. At the same time, they\u2019ve been reluctant to put much stock in weaker indicators they say are transitory -- as Poloz did as recently as this month. \n Deputy Governor Timothy Lane defended of the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to buck the global easing trend, saying in December the nation\u2019s resilient economy is allowing it to \u201cchart its own course in monetary policy.\u201d \n Inflation \n Underlying price pressure as measured by core inflation has been stable near the Bank of Canada\u2019s two-per-cent\u00a0target for about two years. That reflects an economy running nicely at about its capacity -- neither too hot nor too cold. \n Of course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it\u2019s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than one per cent\u00a0for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists. \n But the net effect of the changes isn\u2019t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because of upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada. That means the economy probably had less slack to begin with. \n A weak fourth quarter also doesn\u2019t mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front. \n Housing Rebound \n Officials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern. Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That\u2019s one more reason not to cut. \n Elevated levels of household debt contributed to the governor\u2019s decision to raise rates as much as he did, beginning in mid-2017. It wasn\u2019t a popular move. The higher rates drove up the Canadian dollar, increased debt service ratios for millions of Canadians and even raised eyebrows in government circles. Which is why, having already endured the pain of hiking, Poloz may be even more wary of reversing that move. \n Core Mandate \n To be sure, Poloz won\u2019t hesitate to cut if there\u2019s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank\u2019s primary inflation targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern. \n So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While the markets are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June. \n Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz\u2019s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008.

The way I think about it is that it\u2019s not a barrier to cutting rates per se, but rather a barrier to making small adjustments to policy like some other countries have done. \n The Bank\u2019s models are probably telling it that it should cut interest rates by 25 basis points, but in the grand scheme of things the effect of such a cut on GDP and inflation would be small. They have to trade that small benefit against the risk that they cause a renewed period of speculative activity in the housing market.\u201d \n \u2014 Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist,\u00a0Capital Economics.

Here's how Poloz responded. \n \n \n \u201cNo one should underestimate the BoC's laser focus on its most vital responsibility. The Bank's mandate ensures that its 18-to-24 month inflation projections override virtually all other considerations. \n It's highly unlikely that housing strength would keep the BoC from stimulating the economy if inflation expectations started plummeting. Sufficient economic firewalls are in place. Macroprudential policy is one of them. The government's mortgage stress tests, default insurance restrictions and stricter capital rules all serve to lower the risk of BoC policy exacerbating housing instability.\u201d \n \u2014Rob McLister, founder, RateSpy \n \n \u201cShort answer, yes, it\u2019s a dilemma \u2014\u00a0but a few things: \n \u2022 The strong jump in home prices in places like the GTA in the third quarter is probably unsustainable (due to pent up demand in the past few quarters). So it\u2019s possible the housing inflation will moderate and will make the BoC\u2019s life a bit easier. \r\n\u2022 B-20 (the mortgage stress test) is still around and acts as a negative. \r\n\u2022\u00a0The (Bank of Canada\u2019s posted) five-year rate went up notably, a negative. \r\n\u2022\u00a0And a 25-basis-point cut by the Bank will not impact the five-year rate much and will have little impact on borrowing costs. \n I think that given all the above, the housing market will probably not prevent the bank from moving, by say 25 basis points, if they believe that will prevent, say, a dollar appreciation.\u201d \n \u2014Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist, CIBC Capital Markets \n \n \u201cThe BoC is painted into a corner of sorts. All signs are that the next change in rates is likely to be a cut\u00a0and while the broader economy may eventually need that, the BoC recognizes how a rate cut can impact speculative buying in the housing market. \n It's going to be a challenge to balance these different priorities - lower rates to improve our overall economy knowing that it can present even more risks to our housing market and household debt in the future.\u201d \n \u2014John Pasalis, president, Realosophy Realty\u00a0\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Elena Popina", "title": "The debate over whether to call it QE is over, and the Fed lost", "description": "In the court of investor opinion, the verdict is in.

The Federal Reserve is guilty of quantitative easing. \n Never mind that Chairman Jerome Powell tells everyone his efforts to shore up funding markets are \u201cin no sense\u201d QE. Try as policy-makers may, they\u2019ve lost the ability to convince people that Treasury purchases aren\u2019t at least partially why the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up almost 4,000 points since late August. \n Sure, it\u2019s all labels. If you want to call it QE, you can. Or not. If you want to ascribe the rally to Powell, that\u2019s up to you. Certainly the Fed thinks it\u2019s on solid ground. Rather than trying to drive down long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy, a la QE, it\u2019s simply buying T-bills to keep the financial system\u2019s plumbing in order. \n The problem for policy-makers is that perceptions matter in shaping sentiment. If everyone believes central bank largess is pushing up prices, what happens in the market when it\u2019s turned off? \n \u201cWhether the Fed\u2019s liquidity injection impacted directly the economy or the pricing of assets or not, it\u2019s certainly true that a lot of people think it did,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, Leuthold Group Inc.\u2019s chief investment strategist. \u201cWhether anything is going to change if the Fed takes it away doesn\u2019t matter. If enough people feel it will, then it\u2019s going to impact markets.\u201d \n \n In October, the Fed began buying US$60 billion of Treasury bills per month, a move policymakers deemed as a \u201cpurely technical\u201d way to improve control over the benchmark interest rate they use to guide monetary policy. Monthly purchases of Treasury bills will extend at least into the second quarter of 2020, officials reiterated last month. \n \u201cGrowth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis,\u201d Powell said when the program started. \n Except, the market\u2019s straight-up trajectory is muddying efforts to distinguish the new program from the old one. The S&P 500 has soared 16 per cent\u00a0since its low in August, including the best fourth-quarter rally in six years. Inconveniently for Powell, even his lieutenants say the reaction in stocks isn\u2019t coincidental. \n Low interest rates, a belief there is a high bar to future increases and expansion of its balance sheet are helping to lift asset prices, according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan. \u201cAll three of those actions are contributing to elevated risk-asset valuations,\u201d he said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe ought to be sensitive to that.\u201d \n The ranks of market pundits who agree seems to expand every day. Since the Fed started buying T-bills, the S&P 500 has gone up by almost one per cent\u00a0for every one per cent\u00a0increase in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, Deutsche Bank observed. \n \u201cSo in that sense, Fed balance sheet expansion has at least been correlated with the increase in the stock market we have seen since October,\u201d Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview earlier this month. \n QE refers to the crisis-era policy to boost money supply and lower long-term borrowing costs. It helped pull the economy back from the brink of ruin after the financial crisis. Three rounds of easing programs helped the stock market too, coinciding with a fivefold rally in equities. \n Data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show prior balance-sheet expansions were correlated with stock market gains, too. Through the latest cycle, the S&P 500 notched an annualized gain when the balance sheet was getting bigger that was 5.4 percentage points more than when the central bank was not buying Treasuries, data compiled by Gina Martin Adams, Chief Equity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, show. Every time the central bank has mentioned trimming its holdings, a major equity correction followed, she said. \n In 2011, hints from the Fed that it wouldn\u2019t expand its asset purchase program preceded a 19-per-cent\u00a0drop in the S&P 500. In 2015, talk of balance-sheet shrinkage came before a 12-per-cent\u00a0decline. In late 2018, a comment about a balance sheet unwind on \u201cautopilot\u201d coincided with the near death of the bull market. \n Skeptics say equating quantitative easing with the current program, where the Fed buys short-term debt, is extreme, as is believing that US$60 billion worth of monthly Treasury bill purchases (and sundry other stimulus) holds sway over the direction of a US$30-trillion U.S. stock market. Nevertheless, the wind-down of monthly purchases is the biggest risk facing investors face in 2020, strategists at John Hancock Investment Management said in December. \n \u201cPowell went out of his way to explain that it wasn\u2019t QE, but it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d said Krishna Memani, former vice chairman of investments at Invesco. \u201cThe Fed is in a bind. Effectively with policy initiatives they have, they have to increase reserves, and investors are aware of that.

I worried that for those living so close to the financial margin, dealing with\u00a0even a slight rate\u00a0increase would have pushed them toward insolvency. \n In reality,\u00a0we continued to spend during\u00a0eight\u00a0interest rate announcements in 2019, with\u00a0the Bank of Canada standing\u00a0pat at 1.75 per cent. The low interest rate environment\u00a0isn't likely to change in the near future, and\u00a0despite a  recent survey  by\u00a0MNP Ltd. that revealed Canadians are feeling the pinch, bankruptcies in the country remain below 10 per cent. \n We have managed to muddle through 2019 relatively unscathed. \n This, however, doesn't mean I don't still worry. I worry that the economy isn't strong enough to withstand an interest rate increase. I worry that job losses may happen if the economy slows. And I worry the next\u00a0move by the Bank of Canada might be a rate cut.\u00a0 \n I may have been\u00a0wrong on the day of reckoning for Canadians in 2019; however, I feel\u00a0it could still happen if a job loss occur and your standard of living changes in a heartbeat. \n In either case \u2013 a rate change or job loss \u2013 the outcome is the same. Households will be forced to face their own\u00a0financial facts.\u00a0Only you know how your family would be impacted given either scenario, or in the wake of another wildcard altogether such as the loss of a spouse or partner. \n So on\u00a0the cusp of 2020, I'm optimistic. Let's hope the economy continues to grow, job creation happens, and incomes inch higher. \n However, if that doesn't happen, I'm still hopeful we can all\u00a0plan for financial freedom, controlling what we can, and increasing the odds of financial success \u2013 regardless of the\u00a0day of reckoning your household may be faced with.\u00a0 \n Here are a few considerations. \n 1. Set family financial goals. Determine where you want to be a year from now.\u00a0Share the goal, lock it down and write down. Solicit ideas from the whole family on how you will get there and highlight what you are willing to cut out. Get creative: Shop in your own closet, make your own coffee, enjoy a staycation, look at your weekly food budget, negotiate lower contracts,\u00a0etc. \n \r\n2. Know your numbers. Cut discretionary spending and redirect savings towards debt. Make this a household challenge. Try\u00a0paying\u00a0off the small balance first even though experts will tell you pay of the one with the highest interest rate. Why? Because once you get rid of one outstanding debt, it feels great and momentum builds. Don't get discouraged. It took you some time to get into debt and it will\u00a0take some time to get out of it. \n \r\n3. Establish an emergency fund. Start small. Apply for a line of credit or credit for emergency use only. \n While I may have been wrong about rising interest rates and the knock-on effect to households this year, it\u2019s still worth having a little financial flexibility in your household in 2020. And I know I'm 100 per cent right about that.\u00a0I know I'm right about this 100 per cent. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "How a decade of indebtedness is leaving Canadians at 'peak risk'", "description": "Reporter", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/how-a-decade-of-indebtedness-is-leaving-canadians-at-peak-risk-1.1364435", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 20, 2019", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Greg Bonnell\n                             \n Reporter   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Canadian households are devoting a record amount of their disposable income to making payments on their debt. \n It\u2019s just one measure of how the cheap money meant to save us from the financial crisis has resulted in a decade of indebtedness. \n The stage was set as central bankers began aggressively cutting borrowing costs in late 2007 to encourage spending as a teetering financial system drove the economy into recession. \n It worked \u2013 the encouragement to spend, that is. Canadian households have largely carried the economy on their backs for the last decade as the housing market and consumer spending became key pillars of growth. \n The numbers, as they say, speak for themselves. \n The average Canadian household owes $1.76 for every $1 of annual disposable income. \n The same household devotes 15 cents of every disposable dollar to making principal and interest payments on debt \u2013 a record high. \n \u00a0 \n \n \n When you add together consumer credit, mortgage and non-mortgage loans, Canadians are carrying $2.28 trillion in credit market debt \u2013 and $1.49 trillion of that is mortgage debt. \n The average price of a home in Canada\u2019s largest real estate market \u2013 the Greater Toronto Area \u2013 was $395,460 in 2009. Fast forward to 2019 and prices have more than doubled to a year-to-date average price of $818,386.

This caused the commissioner to warn Canadians to stop using their home as an ATM. \n What we\u2019ve learned along the way is that haphazard spending, while lacking a plan to pay it off, can affect your health, work and state of mind\u2026 The result is Canadians losing sleep about their money woes, millennials lying about their finances and more employees using work time to deal with financial strains. \u201d - Kelley Keehn, consumer advocate, FP Canada \r\n-- \r\n\u201cFor the past decade, Canadians have been using credit to balance their budgets. Annual wages for most people have not risen as fast as their living costs. Build in the dramatic rise in rental rates and mortgage payments we\u2019ve seen in the last year or two, and we have a perfect storm of debt risk. \n Non-homeowners are already starting to break under the weight of the debt they are carrying. With no assets to refinance, they are increasingly filing for insolvency. Insolvency rates across Canada have already increased to levels not seen since the last recession. \n For homeowners, they have a buffer in the form of rising house equity. The next decade looks precarious. High debt equals high risk, and we seem to be at peak risk as we close out the decade.  - Scott Terrio, manager of\u00a0consumer insolvency, Hoyes, Michalos and Associates \r\n-- \n \u201cWhere does this leave the economy? Well, certainly more sensitive to interest rate changes - both on the upside and the downside (and I think the latter is an important point; that is, that even small rate cuts could eventually help more than in the past). \n The good news is, of course, that long-term borrowing costs are far below where they were before the 2008/09 recession, and the economy is able to manage much higher levels of debt. Just as one stark example, Ottawa\u2019s debt-service costs in the past year were $24 billion, or just over one per cent of GDP. In 2007, those figures stood at $33 billion and 2.1 per cent of GDP. So even with a larger debt, the burden of servicing that debt has been chopped in half, thanks to sustained lower borrowing costs. \n For households, the story isn\u2019t quite as friendly, but debt-service ratios of 14.9 per cent are not much different from the 13.5-to-14.5 per cent range seen late last decade.\u201d  \u2013 Douglas Porter, chief economist, BMO Financial Group \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Rafaela Lindeberg", "title": "Sweden's rate hike ends subzero experiment in global test case", "description": "Sweden\u2019s central bank ended half a decade of subzero easing in a move that will provide relief to the finance industry and a test case for global counterparts experimenting with negative borrowing costs.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sweden-s-rate-hike-ends-subzero-experiment-in-global-test-case-1.1364841", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 19, 2019", "content": "Sweden\u2019s central bank ended half a decade of subzero easing in a move that will provide relief to the finance industry and a test case for global counterparts experimenting with negative borrowing costs. \n The Riksbank, once castigated by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman for what he called a \u201csadomonetarist\u201d policy of tightening, is risking similar controversy again after it raised its key rate by a quarter point despite evidence of a slowing economy. \n Governor Stefan Ingves downplayed the growth outlook in the lead-up to the decision with a focus on the harmful effects of negative policy -- in particular, the danger that ultra-low borrowing costs might stoke risky investing.

The European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, Denmark\u2019s central bank and the Bank of Japan are the remaining institutions currently sticking with subzero policy as a central plank of their monetary stance. \n The Swedish move may be watched with intrigue by those counterparts seeking clues on how they might reverse their own negative interest rates in future, if the need arises. \n Policy makers often use the measure to stimulate economic growth, in the hope that it provides an incentive to banks to lend money instead of hoarding it. \n \n But ECB officials, whose own rate is now at minus 0.5 per cent\u00a0after a cut in September, increasingly emphasize the harmful impact of negative rates, from the squeeze on lenders\u2019 profit margins to the threats posed to financial stability by incentivizing investments in riskier assets. A further cut, once seen likely for December, is now rarely threatened by policy makers. \n By contrast, SNB President Thomas Jordan has robustly defended the tool and also says that Switzerland can\u2019t be compared to Sweden. While his institution\u2019s deposit rate, at minus 0.75 per cent, matches Denmark\u2019s as the world\u2019s lowest, he refused to rule out further cuts in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday. \n The removal of negative monetary policy in Sweden will alleviate pressure on the country\u2019s banking system and investment industry. Richard Grottheim, the chief executive of AP7, which oversees more than US$50 billion in assets from Stockholm, complained in an interview this week that the measure \u201ccreated a strange situation in the rates market.\u201d \n The increase is still fraught with risks. While accelerating inflation gave policy makers a green light to tighten, Sweden\u2019s export-focused economy is vulnerable to trade tensions and showing signs of slowing. \n \u201cThe Riksbank\u2019s commitment to a hike, at a time when Sweden has also been negatively affected by the global manufacturing-led slowdown, is sometimes seen as counter-intuitive,\u201d Joao Almeida, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note this week. \u201cHowever, from a cyclical standpoint, Sweden is an economy with a positive output gap and inflation not that far from target.\u201d \n If the tightening goes awry, the Riksbank might face the sort of criticism that accompanied the reversal of a previous tightening cycle that had begun in 2010.

The report added that most insolvencies today are \u201cproposals\u201d to restructure debt rather than outright bankruptcies, meaning fewer legal costs and loan losses for the country\u2019s lenders due to a higher recovery rate for \u201cproposals.\u201d \n CIBC also found that consumer insolvencies jumped the most in Ontario and Alberta on a year-over-year basis, with Quebec and Saskatchewan seeing the lowest increase. \n Furthermore, the report found that insolvencies are affecting all age groups.

That measure began climbing in the early 1980s and reached a record 49 per cent\u00a0in 2018. \n Now, Fed officials themselves are increasingly talking about inequality, wage growth is outpacing mortgage rates for the first time since Richard Nixon occupied the White House, and policy makers are more often heard fretting about the possibility of inflation staying too low than getting too high. \n The world facing them in 2019 looks very different from the one Volcker inherited in the 1970s, and the policy regime they\u2019ve put in place \u2014\u00a0one of low interest rates \u2014\u00a0is therefore widely expected to prevail at least for the foreseeable future. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Steve Matthews", "title": "Fed dots may yield clue on split over pause", "description": "While Jerome Powell is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold at the central bank\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, some of his colleagues may be looking ahead to when they should hike again.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-dots-may-yield-clue-on-split-over-pause-1.1360777", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 11, 2019", "content": "While Jerome Powell is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold at the central bank\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, some of his colleagues may be looking ahead to when they should hike again. \n The Federal Reserve chairman looks all but certain to keep rates unchanged after reductions at the previous three gatherings as insurance against slowing global growth and trade disputes. The Federal Open Market Committee will release a statement and updated quarterly forecasts at 2 p.m. in Washington with Powell holding a press conference 30 minutes later. \n \n Powell is likely to repeat his recent comments that both monetary policy and the economy are \u201cin a good place\u201d and that it would take a \u201cmaterial reassessment\u201d of the outlook to prompt a chance in rates. \n The FOMC\u2019s rate forecast through 2022 will be closely watched. While economists\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Bloomberg see them staying on hold for the next two years, a sizable number of Fed officials may prefer to resume raising rates as early as 2020. \n \u201cThe dot plot is most likely going to say rates are on hold next year,\u201d said John Herrmann, director of U.S. rates strategy at MUFG Securities Americas Inc. \u201cBut it\u2019s a really close call. There will be a segment of the FOMC that wants to get back to normalizing rates.\u201d \n Investors are pricing in no change this week and one additional cut by the end of next year, though odds of a cut lessened after a stronger than expected U.S. payroll report. Labor Department data on Friday\u00a0showed\u00a0266,000 new jobs were created in November, the most since January, while wages topped estimates. \n In its forecasts, the committee may lower the\u00a0estimate\u00a0of the long-term unemployment rate from 4.2 per cent. That\u2019s because wage pressures remain modest despite unemployment matching a half-century low of 3.5 per cent. Growth and inflation forecasts are not expected to change much. \n What Bloomberg Economists Say \n \u201cThe dot plot previously signaled that the next Fed action will be an interest rate hike in 2021. The latest iteration will signal whether policy makers are considering rate moves in the run-up to\u00a0the presidential election.\u201d \n -- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger \n \u201cThe jobs report has put wind into the sail of Jay Powell going into the press conference,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. \u201cThe insurance seems to have worked. At the same time there are no inflation pressures. Wage growth is fine but they can be patient. It is a pretty happy way to end the year.\u201d \n The FOMC statement is likely to get only minor tweaks, reflecting little change in the outlook since the last meeting. It could upgrade its description of the job market slightly, while continuing to characterize growth as being \u201cmoderate.\u201d \n Holding rates steady in a target range of 1.5 per cent-1.75\u00a0per cent\u00a0may also see Powell end the year on a vote of unanimous support. Previous 2019 meetings have been marked by dissents from the Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren, who opposed rate cuts, and James Bullard at the St. Louis Fed, who sought a deeper reduction at the September meeting, when officials cut by a quarter percentage point. \n George and Rosengren have argued low rates could increase financial stability threats, and a recent Fed\u00a0report\u00a0echoed those concerns, noting they could promote risky investment. \n Overshadowing the meeting for some investors may be lingering uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China, as well as the prospects for Brexit. As a result, Powell might want to emphasize that the Fed is keeping its opens open, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus. \n \u201cI would prefer to hear a more data-dependent stance as opposed to a predetermined position on the sideline, but I am only cautiously optimistic for such a tone,\u201d she said. \n The U.S. central bank may also discuss its balance sheet, though it has preferred to announce any changes separately from FOMC meetings. The committee is buying Treasury bills at an initial pace of US$60 billion a month. Officials view this as a technical change to restore ample banking reserves in the system to relieve strain in repo markets, and not intended as stimulus. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Susanne Barton", "title": "Swagger seeps out of loonie as Canada growth concerns intensify", "description": "The Canadian dollar\u2019s outperformance this year stunned many, but strategists are not expecting a repeat in 2020 -- casting doubt on its run as one of the best major currencies.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/swagger-seeps-out-of-loonie-as-canada-growth-concerns-intensify-1.1360348", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 10, 2019", "content": "The Canadian dollar\u2019s outperformance this year stunned many, but strategists are not expecting a repeat in 2020 -- casting doubt on its run as one of the best major currencies. \n Just last week, the nation\u2019s central bank cited a tightening labor market as a main reason why it can buck the global easing trend and keep its policy rate at the highest levels among advanced economies. That upbeat tone didn\u2019t last long when November labor force survey showed a surprise job loss, weakening the loonie by its biggest decline since October. \n Now, clouds are gathering on the prospects for the Canadian currency, which is in a neck-and-neck race with the British pound for the No. 1 spot among all its major peers this year. \n Traders see about a 60 per cent\u00a0chance of a rate cut in the next 12 months, double what was expected before the jobs data, according to swaps trading. An index from Citigroup Inc. -- which falls when data prove worse than forecast -- is at the lowest since September 2018, indicating that Canada\u2019s growth might be slowing down at a faster pace than analysts expect. \n \u201cCanada will be more vulnerable to a local growth slowdown in 2020, to the detriment\u201d of the Canadian dollar, strategists Patrick Locke and Daniel Hui at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a recent report. The team expects the currency to weaken and the central bank to cut interest rates in January. \n Currency traders will be eyeing the next batch of economic data and Bank of Canada\u2019s policy decision in late January as economic growth turns sluggish. \n The central bank may \u201cnot sound as confident at its next meetings in January and March, likely preparing for a cut in April,\u201d said Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, which has US$2.5 trillion in invested assets. \u201cGlobal growth is set to remain weak into the New Year, and Canadian growth is on a downward path,\u201d he said in an email last week. \n There are more risks to the Canadian dollar\u2019s strength. Investors are still cautious as Washington and Beijing continue to work toward a phase-one trade agreement that has yet to be signed. U.S. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t ruled out hiking the tariffs set to take effect on Chinese goods on Dec. 15, with additional levies likely to reduce the appetite for riskier assets, including commodity-linked currencies. \n And the outlook for oil prices is still murky. The loonie has benefited from Canada\u2019s oil exports. Yet demand growth is slowing and another big expansion in global production may be ahead. That fear prompted Saudi Arabia to announce deeper production cuts last week as an oversupply crisis could drive international prices back down toward US$50 a barrel. \n There are some wild cards too: \n \u2022 The approval of the USMCA, a free trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada that is awaiting passage in U.S. congress. \n \u2022 The ongoing transportation challenges in the Canadian energy sector could impact the petrocurrency. \n \u2022 A leadership change scheduled at the Bank of Canada after Governor Stephen Poloz announced he won\u2019t seek a second term. \n \u2022 Elevated household debt has helped to keep the BOC from chasing its peers in cutting rates this year. \n \n Positive Yields \n To be sure, bulls say there are many factors that augur well for the currency. Strategists forecast the Canadian currency will strengthen against the greenback by about 1.8 per cent\u00a0by the end of next year, albeit a smaller rise compared to this year\u2019s three per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n In a world awash with over US$11.8 trillion in negative-yielding debt, Canada boasts some of the highest yields among Group-of-10 currencies. Its two-year note yields at 1.66 per cent\u00a0exceed U.S. equivalents by about 5.4 basis points. That\u2019s in part because the nation\u2019s central bank has been reluctant to cut its key interest rate of 1.75 per cent, the highest among G-7 countries. \n Foreign investments are also at the highest level since 2015, boosting demand for the currency. \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s plans for tax cuts for most Canadians, \u201cshould buoy growth\u201d in 2020, Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. The loonie \u201cwould particularly benefit if corporate or payrolls taxes were lowered.\u201d Anderson expects the currency to strengthen against the U.S. dollar to $1.29 by year-end 2020, near the median strategist estimate of $1.30. \n Still, with the near-term headwinds facing the currency, UBS\u2019s Rose expects the Canadian dollar\u2019s performance will worsen before it recovers later in 2020. The currency could weaken against the U.S. dollar to $1.34 before rebounding by year-end to $1.29, amid \u201cimprovement in global growth and general U.S. dollar weakness,\u201d he said. \n The loonie is heading for a third yearly gain against the greenback in four. It\u2019s up 6.3 per cent\u00a0against the euro this year and 1.9 per\u00a0cent\u00a0against the yen as of Dec. 9. All eyes will be on Poloz as he speaks at an event in Toronto on Dec. 12. \n \u201cThe BOC is cognizant that cutting rates is a double-edged sword likely to cause companies and households to add to an already large pile of debt,\u201d strategists led by Martin Roberge at Canaccord Genuity Capital Markets wrote in a note earlier this month. Roberge expects the central bank to cut rates in the first quarter and the loonie should depreciate. \n --With assistance from Laura Cooper. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Vivien Lou Chen and Alexandra Harris", "title": "Bond traders trim bets on 2020 Fed rate cut on U.S. jobs strength", "description": "Treasury yields rose and traders stepped back from fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve next year after November U.S. job growth trounced expectations.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bond-traders-trim-bets-on-2020-fed-rate-cut-on-u-s-jobs-strength-1.1358730", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Dec 6, 2019", "content": "Treasury yields rose and traders stepped back from fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve next year after November U.S. job growth trounced expectations. \n The benchmark 10-year yield rose three\u00a0basis points to 1.84 per cent, and is now up about seven\u00a0basis points on the week.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut its rate three times this year. \n However, Lane said there is no reason for the Bank of Canada to move in step with the U.S. Federal Reserve. \n \"On the contrary, the experience of the past decade shows that Canada and the United States have followed different roads, reflecting differences in our economic conditions,\" he said. \n Lane said the resilience in the economy here at home has allowed the central bank to chart its own course. \n In making its rate decision in October, the Bank of Canada said it considered the possibility of cutting its key interest rate target as insurance against an economic slowdown, but decided it wasn't worth the cost. \n Lane said Thursday that the bank did not reopen that discussion when making its most recent decision. \n \"This time we'd already had that conversation so it was more a question of has anything material changed and our assessment was that the outlook still remained on track, so we didn't really reopen that question,\" he told reporters in a news conference. \n TD Bank senior economist Brian DePratto said the Bank of Canada sounds like it does not want to cut rates unless absolutely needed. \n \"It is hard to imagine more clear a way to communicate this than a speech focused in large part on how Canada has diverged from its international peers in the past,\" he wrote in a report. \n \"The bank remains clear in the barometers it will be watching to assess the resilience of the Canadian economy: consumer spending and housing activity remain front and centre.\" \n The Bank of Canada said Wednesday that concerns about a potential global recession are waning, but ongoing trade conflicts and related uncertainty still weigh on the global economy and remain the biggest source of risk to its outlook. \n Meanwhile, economic growth in Canada slowed in the third quarter to an annual pace of 1.3 per cent, matching the forecast by the Bank of Canada in its monetary policy report in October, while inflation has remained close to the central bank's target of two per cent. \n \"Overall, the tone of developments in recent weeks gives us more confidence in the outlook for growth and inflation that we set out back in October,\" Lane said. \n The central bank noted business investment spending in Canada, which rose 2.6 per cent in the third quarter, was stronger than expected. \n \"We were expecting investment to decline in the second half of this year, but instead we have seen solid growth.

Underlying price pressures have been steady and on target for well over a year, suggesting the economy has been running near capacity. Canada is also home to some of the highest household debt levels in the world, constraining the central bank\u2019s ability to cut further for fear of encouraging even more borrowing. \n \u201cWe think we\u2019ve got monetary conditions about right given the situation,\u201d Poloz said at his last public appearance on Nov. 21. The Canadian economy is \u201cstill in a good place overall.\u201d \n Pressure on the Bank of Canada to match rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve is easing anyhow. Markets have begun paring back bets that global monetary loosening has much left to go. \n Swaps trading shows about a four per cent\u00a0chance of a cut in Ottawa on Wednesday, and only one-in-four odds of a move at the next meeting in January. All 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the Bank of Canada holding steady on Wednesday. \n To be sure, the Bank of Canada has begun hedging its bets by talking about the possibility of a cut if needed, a nod to the growing risks from the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Poloz could lower rates if he sees the uncertainty spilling over into the nation\u2019s economy, particularly if it begins to crimp consumer sentiment. \n But it will be a delicate balancing act. With the economy near its capacity, policy makers will want to see either a clear materialization of downside risks to the global economy \u2014\u00a0for example, the collapse of talks between China and the U.S. \u2014\u00a0or some evidence domestically that the anticipated slowdown is sharper than expected. \n \n Third-quarter output data released Friday showed a benign picture, however. The economy did slow to an annualized pace of 1.3 per cent, but growth came in exactly as forecast by the Bank of Canada. Exporters, the most exposed to the global trade tensions, struggled as expected, but business investment surprised with a strong rebound. That, along with the pick up in consumption and housing and upward revisions to growth, will give policy makers plenty of positives to draw on as they deliberate policy this week. \n While there doubts remain about whether the jump in business investment is sustainable, consumption and housing seem to be on more solid footing -- supported by a robust jobs market, cheaper mortgage loans thanks to lower global bond yields and accelerated wage gains. \n After the slowdown in the second half of 2019, growth should accelerate over the next two years back to around its potential as business investment and exports recover, and consumption growth holds steady, the Bank of Canada estimates. There are no obvious clues yet in the data that should knock the central bank off that view. \n That\u2019s not counting additional stimulus expected down the line from Justin Trudeau\u2019s government. The prime minister has pledged to ramp up federal deficits to $27 billion\u00a0next year, bringing the budget gap to about 1.1 per cent\u00a0of gross domestic product from about 0.9 per cent\u00a0this year. \n The next couple of weeks should provide the first taste of what\u2019s in store, as lawmakers reconvene on Thursday.

According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country\u2019s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent\u00a0annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent\u00a0in the prior period. \n It\u2019s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation\u2019s households cope with high debt levels. \n Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent\u00a0reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn\u2019t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent\u00a0in 2020. That\u2019s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January. \n Canada\u2019s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they\u2019ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3\u00a0 per cent\u00a0since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased one per cent\u00a0in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal. \n Business investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent\u00a0since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada\u2019s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures. \n \n Consumption has long propelled Canada\u2019s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that\u2019s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012.

The trick for the chairman will be to carry out monetary policy without appearing to cave to the president \u2014 and the president, meanwhile, needs to give the chairman some room to work. \n The official responses from both parties following their meeting this week suggest that they might finally realize this. Just after the meeting Trump offered a critical but notably restrained tweet (only later did he note that he \u201cprotested\u201d high interest rates). Powell\u2019s statement, terse even by the tight-lipped standards of the Fed, simply reiterated that he will be guided by its mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. \n Both responses underscore the need for Powell to avoid being seen as overly influenced by the president. \n Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the economic consensus. He rejects arguments for free trade, openly scorns global institutions and prefers to promote U.S. interests in foreign countries rather than free markets and the rule of law. He has also driven economists to distraction by challenging the two pillars of central banking: independence from political influence and a strong bias toward lower inflation. \n These tenets developed in the wake of the high inflation of the 1970s, which led to political efforts to pressure central banks into lowering interest rates, even in the face of rising inflation. But they are currently being rethought. \n An increasing number of\u00a0economists are questioning the prevailing models of the economy\u2019s full potential. And now Powell himself is cautioning against overreliance on contemporaneous models of economic output. \n Typically the Fed has used such models to predict when inflation was imminent, then raised interest rates in response. But in his last press conference Powell went so far as to rule out the possibility of raising interest rates until inflation was actually increasing, effectively throwing out any dependence on inflation-forecasting models. Powell has also said repeatedly that low inflation, not high inflation, is the greater danger. \n That view puts him at odds with the received wisdom \u2014 and on the side of Trump. The problem is that while Powell wants to throw out the low-inflation-bias portion of the modern consensus, he is keen on keeping the political-independence part. \n So even as Powell effectively agrees with the president, he cannot afford to be seen as bowing to Trump\u2019s pressure. That means that Trump\u2019s excoriations against the Fed actually serve to undermine a natural ally. If Trump can restrain himself (admittedly a big if) and Powell can make an effective economic (rather than political) case for a softer line on inflation, then both men will get the monetary policy they want \u2014 and that America needs. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Resilient growth in Canada just got a fresh warning signal", "description": "For the first time this year, the Canadian economy is coming in below analyst expectations, according to a closely watched gauge of economic surprises.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/resilient-growth-in-canada-just-got-a-fresh-warning-signal-1.1350421", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 19, 2019", "content": "For the first time this year, the Canadian economy is coming in below analyst expectations, according to a closely watched gauge of economic surprises. \n The index from Citigroup Inc. \u2014\u00a0which falls when data prove worse than forecast \u2014\u00a0dropped below zero on Tuesday, for the first time since December.

That\u2019s a sign pressures may continue to build in the weeks ahead and evidence that there\u2019s skepticism about Powell\u2019s attempt to reassure markets on Wednesday. \n The central bank has been injecting liquidity into the funding markets since Sept. 17, when the rate on overnight general collateral repo jumped to 10 per cent\u00a0from around two per cent. The Fed also started buying Treasury bills last month to add reserves into the system. These efforts have mostly calmed repo rates. But many are yearning for more fundamental adjustments to how the market works. \n Almost two months after the spike, \u201cthe Fed has used a Band-Aid to ensure the money markets don\u2019t seize up and spike again,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cThe short-term fix is in but the longer-term plan remains very unclear.\u201d \n Market participants next week will be parsing the release of the minutes from the Oct. 29-30 Federal Open Market Committee meeting for more detail about potential long-term fixes for the funding markets. At the same time, they\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the central bank\u2019s ongoing repo operations, T-bill purchases, as well as looking ahead to key crunch dates. \n Speaking to members of the U.S. Congress Wednesday, Powell discussed the mid-September turmoil, saying the Fed has contained the strains within the repo market. \n \u201cI think we have it under control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to continue to learn and adjust, but it\u2019s a process and it\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t have implications for the economy or general public.\u201d \n He said the repo chaos might have been caused by bank reserves getting too scarce two months ago. But he also addressed the possibility -- something raised recently by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon -- that regulations clogged the plumbing, preventing banks from moving money around. \n There are aspects of regulations that could be adjusted to allow liquidity \u201cto flow more freely in the system without undermining safety and soundness,\u201d Powell said. \n Rules passed after the 2008 financial crisis were designed to ensure banks had ample liquidity if a market shock made them unable or unwilling to lend to each other. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic front-runner to challenge Donald Trumpin the 2020 election, recently warned Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to tinker with these requirements \u2014\u00a0which include so-called liquidity coverage ratios \u2014\u00a0since they\u2019re meant to prevent catastrophes. \n But on Oct. 30, Powell brought up one possibility that would be an alternative to lowering capital and liquidity requirements: letting banks run \u201cdaylight overdrafts\u201d in their Fed accounts \u2014\u00a0meaning they could have gaps between payments and settlements during the day as long as they closed them by the close of business. \n FTN Capital Markets strategist Jim Vogel said the next test for the money markets will be appetite for the Fed\u2019s term repo offering that bridges the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and month-end. \n The New York Fed is expected to release new schedules on Thursday for its repo operations. It\u2019s also set to outline the schedule for reserve management and reinvestment of Treasury purchases. \n Once month-end is out of the way, Vogel said the next flash point for the funding markets will be Dec. 16, which is when the next quarterly corporate tax payment comes due and Treasury coupon auctions will settle. The September tax due date coincided with the big repo-market disruption. These events will transpire as financial institutions retreat from repo to shore up their year-end balance sheets for regulatory purposes. \n The regulatory pullback is why Bank of America\u2019s Cabana is still concerned about late December and said the liquidity and Treasury-purchase schedules should provide clarity as to whether the central bank shares those same concerns. He said longer-term repo tenors or an increased amount of T-bill purchases could signal that policy makers are trying to get ahead of the potential turmoil. \n \u201cI\u2019m not willing to say it\u2019s all-clear,\u201d Cabana said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to concede that the Fed has a handle on this issue until we have more clarity as to how year-end funding evolves.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "The safest bet in Canada is also one of the hottest ETF trades", "description": "There\u2019s something going on in a corner of Canada\u2019s market that suggests investors are looking for shelter.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-safest-bet-in-canada-is-also-one-of-the-hottest-etf-trades-1.1346207", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 11, 2019", "content": "There\u2019s something going on in a corner of Canada\u2019s market that suggests investors are looking for shelter. \n More than US$1.1 billion has flowed into high-interest savings exchange-traded funds this year, placing them among the hottest investments in that category, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Under its dual mandate, the RBNZ must support maximum sustainable employment as well as maintain price stability. \n \u201cThe labor market is likely to cool further,\u201d said Jarrod Kerr, chief economist at Kiwibank in Auckland. \u201cFirms\u2019 hiring intentions are tracking well below averages, and economic growth is likely to slow further.\u201d \n The economy expanded 2.1 per cent\u00a0in the year through June, down from 3.2 per cent\u00a0a year earlier. The RBNZ in August predicted a pick up to three per cent\u00a0by mid-2020, which now looks optimistic. It needs growth to exceed 2.7 per cent\u00a0for the economy to generate faster inflation, Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand said in August. \n One crucial piece of the puzzle is the RBNZ\u2019s quarterly survey of inflation expectations, which it is due to publish at 3 p.m. today. Its two-year ahead measure fell to 1.86 per cent\u00a0from 2.01 per cent\u00a0at the last reading, immediately before the August rate cut. \n Dominick Stephens, chief New Zealand economist at Westpac in Auckland, said ongoing weakness in this piece of data could prompt him to change his prediction that the RBNZ will keep rates on hold in what he describes as a \u201cnail biter\u201d decision. \n \u201cWe are expecting expectations to rebound a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that is correct, then an on-hold OCR decision will look more likely. If, however, expectations remain low or fall further, then we would seriously consider switching our call to a cut.\u201d \n --With assistance from Tomoko Sato. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Liz Capo McCormick, John Ainger and David Goodman", "title": "Central banks hitting 'peak dovishness' prick bond-market bubble", "description": "This year\u2019s flood of monetary easing is slowing to a trickle as the world\u2019s central banks judge they\u2019ve done enough to avoid a recession, giving investors cause to think sovereign bond yields have finally bottomed.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/central-banks-hitting-peak-dovishness-prick-bond-market-bubble-1.1343888", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 6, 2019", "content": "This year\u2019s flood of monetary easing is slowing to a trickle as the world\u2019s central banks judge they\u2019ve done enough to avoid a recession, giving investors cause to think sovereign bond yields have finally bottomed. \n Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week said policy had reached an \u201cappropriate\u201d level after three cuts in interest rates this year. Mounting criticism of the European Central Bank\u2019s negative rates leaves its new president, Christine Lagarde, under pressure to hold fire on additional stimulus, and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may be even closer to the limits of monetary policy. \n As economists at Citigroup Inc. declare the arrival of \u201cpeak dovishness,\u201d investors are responding by offloading bonds on the assumption there will be less support from aggressive central banks going forward. The 10-year Treasury yield, a benchmark for debt around the globe, has rebounded to nearly two per cent\u00a0from a three-year low of 1.43 per cent\u00a0in September, with the rest of the world\u2019s markets following in its wake. \n \u201cWe are past the peak of central banks easing,\u201d said Peter Schaffrik, a global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cYou may get a few more cuts here and there, but the extreme cutting phase is over. And with that, yields in the U.S. and globally are at risk of going higher. I\u2019d be cautious about fixed income now.\u201d \n Of the 57 institutions monitored by Bloomberg, more than half cut borrowing costs this year, reaching a crescendo in recent weeks. \n \n Now the tone is changing amid signs that the worst is over for a global economic slowdown and that the U.S. and China may be able to resolve some of their differences over trade policy. Sweden\u2019s Riksbank is even stressing its determination to hike by the end of the year. \n Policy-makers also know they can only cut interest rates so far, and in countries where they\u2019ve turned negative there\u2019s a growing backlash from banks and politicians. Many, including Lagarde and Kuroda, are placing the onus on governments to do more to support demand if needed. \n \u201cCentral banks may be approaching the limit in terms of how much more they can help the economy,\u201d said Pernille Henneberg, an economist at Citigroup. \u201cIf financial conditions had reached tight territory, that could have been very damaging to the economy. They have tried to go against all the uncertainty from the trade war, and maybe they have done enough now. Focus is now changing to what fiscal and monetary coordination can do.\u201d \n False Dawns \n While there\u2019s a shift in momentum, investors will be all too aware that the past decade has seen several false dawns for both central bank rates and yields. This time last year, economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among those predicting the Fed would raise rates four times in 2019. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon famously warned in 2018 that the U.S 10-year yield was headed to four per cent\u00a0from about three per cent. \n And though there are signs the slowdown may be bottoming out, risks remain. It\u2019s not clear whether trade talks between Washington and Beijing will continue toward a comprehensive agreement and the European Union and U.K. have still to resolve Brexit. Inflation also remains well below the target of what many central banks are mandated to deliver. \n \u201cCentral banks may well have reached the peak of what they\u2019re willing to do right now, but I do not think that will last in 2020,\u201d said Luke Hickmore, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, who is snapping up bonds across Germany, Australia and Canada. \u201cI am a buyer if yields jump higher.\u201d \n There may yet be room for more rate reductions. Economists at Bloomberg Economics are among a handful who say the Fed will do more in coming months, and Switzerland and Australia could also shift. Emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Russia may act too. \n But the brunt of the easing is probably over unless the outlook darkens again. For traders, that may be a game-changer after a decade of monetary juice kept a lid on yields and left about US$13 trillion of investment-grade global bonds with rates below zero. \n Feeling Rosy \n What\u2019s bad news for havens such as government bonds may be good news for other asset classes. U.S. stock benchmarks climbed to all-time highs this week, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index marched to a four-year high and major Asian indexes advanced. U.S. investment-grade debt has also rallied. \n \u201cCentral banks will mostly stay quiet next year on monetary policy,\u201d said Fabrizio Fiorini, the chief investment officer at UBI Pramerica SGR. \u201cThere also won\u2019t be the same level of trade-war struggles. This environment will be one marked by better growth, higher yields \u2014\u00a0with steeper yield curves \u2014\u00a0and more stable developed-market share prices.\u201d \n Markets are feeling more rosy than just weeks ago. It\u2019s true that money markets point to more easing, rather than tightening, by central banks, but pricing for the next Fed move has pushed out toward 2021. And while 15 basis points of cuts were factored in for the ECB by the end of this year, none are now expected at least through the end of 2020. \n \u201cAfter all the central bank easing, the market is pricing in that they expect growth,\u201d Brian Weinstein, head of global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Bloomberg TV. And regarding trade wars and political issues, the sense is that \u201cuncertainty has peaked.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Enda Curran and Paul Gordon", "title": "Worst may be over for global economy amid signs of stabilization", "description": "The worst may be over for the world economy\u2019s deepest slowdown in a decade.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/worst-may-be-over-for-global-economy-amid-signs-of-stabilization-1.1343296", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Nov 5, 2019", "content": "The worst may be over for the world economy\u2019s deepest slowdown in a decade. \n A wave of interest-rate cuts by central banks including the Federal Reserve and mounting hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal are buoying confidence in financial markets just as key economic indicators show signs of stabilization after recent declines. \n While a robust rebound may still not be on the cards, the relative improvement could put an end to the fears of just a few weeks ago that the world economy was barreling toward recession. Such an environment looks for now to be enough for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and fellow monetary policy makers to take a pause from doling out monetary stimulus. \n \u201cWe do see multiple reasons for a stabilization in global growth in 2020 versus 2019,\u201d said David Mann, chief economist for Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore, who shares the International Monetary Fund\u2019s expectation that global growth will accelerate next year. \n Among the reasons for confidence: While JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s global manufacturing index contracted for a sixth month in October, it nonetheless advanced for a third month as output and orders firmed. \n In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s gauge of factory activity stabilized in October while the government\u2019s jobs report on Friday showed payroll gains exceeded forecasts and hiring in the previous two months was revised much higher. The ISM\u2019s gauge of services is also showing signs of improvement. \n \n In Europe, there are also tentative signs of health after it was squeezed by the trade war as well as Brexit. The euro-area economy expanded more than forecast in the third quarter and while Germany may already be in recession, the Ifo Institute reported that expectations among its manufacturers edged up in October. \n As for Asia, inventories of semiconductors in South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September in a sign a slump in global technology is ending. \n Financial markets are tuning into the optimism. U.S. stock benchmarks climbed to all-time highs on Monday and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. European and Asian stocks have also advanced. \n \u201cI just look at the fiscal/monetary mix, it\u2019s the most stimulative that I think I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that the stock market\u2019s hitting new highs. It\u2019s literally the most conducive environment, certainly in the short run, for economic growth and strength that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \n One key reason for the potential turn is the wave of interest-rate cuts from global central banks. Of the 57 institutions monitored by Bloomberg, more than half cut borrowing costs this year with the Fed doing so three times and the European Central Bank pushing its deposit rate further into negative territory. Rate cuts also operate with a lag so the positive effects of easier monetary policy have yet to fully flow through, meaning a further impulse likely awaits. \n Powell last week hinted the U.S. central bank may be done reducing borrowing costs as he said the stance of policy was now \u201cappropriate\u201d to keep the economy growing moderately. \u201cIt would take a material change in the outlook for me to think that further accommodation would be required,\u201d Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Monday. \n Trade Talks \n Also driving sentiment is that President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping are on the cusp of signing \u201cphase one\u201d on a trade deal, which could be enough for global commerce to find a footing. China is reviewing locations in the U.S. where Xi would be willing to meet with Trump to sign a pact. \n Meantime, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Washington has also enjoyed \u201cgood conversations\u201d with automakers in the European Union, raising hopes that the Trump administration may not slap tariffs on imported automobiles this month. \n Morgan Stanley economists reckon the contraction in global trade volumes likely narrowed in October, declining 0.6% compared to 1.3% in September. Retail, auto and semiconductor sales are all stabilizing, they said in a report this week. \n Deadline Extension \n Elsewhere in Europe, the risks of a so-called no-deal Brexit have also diminished after the EU extended the deadline on the U.K.\u2019s departure until the end of January and Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a December election in the hopes of breaking the impasse between politicians. \n The soft landing scenario isn\u2019t fully sealed. In May, similar hopes were building, only for Trump to ramp up tensions with China. While Washington and Beijing have signaled they\u2019re getting closer to agreeing on the first phase of a deal, it\u2019s not clear whether trade talks would continue toward a comprehensive agreement. \n \u201cIf the U.S.-Chinese trade escalates again, or if the U.S. starts a new trade war against the only other economy of almost equal size, the EU, it could all still go wrong,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. \u201cBut in the absence of such new political shocks, chances are that the global downturn could peter out in early 2020 and make way for a modest upturn thereafter.\u201d \n The strength of any revival may ultimately depend on the health of China\u2019s economy, which expanded in the third quarter at its weakest pace in decades and where evidence of a bottoming out in demand remains tentative. \n A gauge of Chinese manufacturing dropped this month to the lowest level since February while a measure of new export orders contracted at a faster pace. At the same time, construction, real estate, consumption and services are holding up, buoying expectations that officials are managing a gradual slowdown. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Ivan Levingston", "title": "Fed is edged out by Israel as top pick for unconventional easing", "description": "Hounded for months by President Donald Trump to cut interest rates below zero, the Federal Reserve still isn\u2019t the top contender to wade into unconventional monetary policy, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fed-is-edged-out-by-israel-as-top-pick-for-unconventional-easing-1.1340902", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 31, 2019", "content": "Hounded for months by President Donald Trump to cut interest rates below zero, the Federal Reserve still isn\u2019t the top contender to wade into unconventional monetary policy, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. \n The Bank of Israel, with inflation below target and the lowest positive policy rate in the world, is the likeliest to take the plunge next, Nomura analysts led by its head of global macro research in Singapore, Rob Subbaraman, said in a report Thursday. The U.S. is a runner-up, the bank\u2019s scorecard found. \n \u201cWith dwindling traditional ammunition, a number of smaller economies appear closer to following their larger-country counterparts into unconventional monetary policy,\u201d the analysts said. \n Boxed in by rates near zero and running out of options to rev up economies and inflation, a new crop of central banks could opt for unorthodox policies. The unconventional tools range from negative borrowing costs and large-scale asset purchases to deposit tiering and targeted lending. To build its ranking, Nomura looked at countries\u2019 economies, the scope for conventional monetary easing, and suitability for unconventional measures. \n \n Although Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said last month that negative interest rates were a possibility, Nomura\u2019s economists said policy makers may instead restart large-scale currency purchases to stem appreciating pressure on the shekel. \n As for the Fed, it\u2019s more likely to use forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases to fight the next recession, but won\u2019t cut rates below zero, Nomura\u2019s economists said. \n It\u2019s a conclusion likely to draw Trump\u2019s ire. On Thursday, the U.S. president resumed his attacks a day after the Fed lowered rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in further cuts unless the economic outlook changes materially. \n Despite the growing number of policy makers looking at non-traditional monetary tools, such measures face numerous challenges, Nomura\u2019s analysts warned.

Powell also noted in the press conference that the risks associated with trade tensions and Brexit show signs of improving. \n Treasuries weakened on the Fed\u2019s announcement, pushing the 10-year yield up slightly to 1.81 per cent from 1.80 per cent. Stocks were slightly higher and the U.S. dollar gained. Traders also\u00a0pared\u00a0wagers on a fourth consecutive rate cut in December. \n The tweaks to the statement suggest policy makers are prepared to leave rates on hold for some time and assess the impact on the economy of their reductions over the past three meetings. \n While lower rates do little to combat the uncertain trade picture, unemployment has continued to drop, consumer spending has remained solid and lower mortgage rates have revived the housing market. \n \u201cWhat we continue to see is good job creation,\u201d Powell said. \n Hours before the decision, the Commerce Department reported the economy grew at a 1.9 per cent annualized pace in the third quarter, beating estimates. The better-than-expected consumer spending was partly offset by weakness in business investment. \n The Fed\u2019s cuts have also calmed markets compared to the beginning of the year when investors grew nervous that monetary policy was too tight. Pricing in fed funds futures implies investors don\u2019t fully expect another cut until well into 2020. \n The same cannot be said for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the Fed. He complained on Tuesday that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue!\u201d and has called on Powell to slash rates to zero while tweeting favorably about negative rates applied by central banks in Europe and Japan. \n Dissenting Votes \n As with the past two cuts, Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren dissented, preferring to keep rates unchanged. \n The FOMC didn\u2019t release a new set of economic forecasts and rate projections at this meeting, so it\u2019s unclear how many non-voters on the committee had also penciled in a reduction. \n The statement again highlighted the essentially positive condition of the U.S. economy. With unemployment at a half-century low, officials continued to describe the labor market as \u201cstrong,\u201d job gains as \u201csolid\u201d and household spending as rising at a \u201cstrong pace.\u201d \n At the same time, they repeated a references to \u201cuncertainties\u2019\u2019 in the economic outlook. Officials also made a minor change to say business fixed investment and exports \u201cremain weak.\u201d The prior statement had said that they had weakened. \n Faltering Factories \n That softness has shown up in data from the manufacturing sector this year, though factory output rose slightly in the third quarter. Fed officials have been watching for signs that weakness in manufacturing and faltering confidence in the business sector might threaten consumer spending, particularly if the job market cools. The Labor Department will release its October employment report on Friday. \n Fed officials also noted that inflation was running below their 2 per cent target and said \u201cinflation expectations are little changed.\u201d \n Officials continued ordering the purchase of Treasury bills to boost bank reserves.

He said if global economic performance weakens further and trade conflicts ramp and up, then job creation could be tested. If in fact the U.S. flirts with a recession in the months ahead, there will be a knock-on affect here in Canada. \n So the central bank raising interest rates may not be the day of reckoning for indebted Canadians; it could be their job loss, a reduction in average hourly wages, or the lack of a bonus that some have come to count on. \n My rallying call to action is to take charge now.

The Canadian dollar dropped on the statement, falling 0.4 per cent\u00a0to $1.3137 per U.S. dollar at 10:05 a.m. in Toronto trading. \n \u201cBank of Canada held its target overnight rate unchanged, as expected, but with a slightly more dovish tilt,\u201d Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, said by e-mail. \u201cWhile not entirely setting up a cut at its next meeting, this leaves open the door a bit further for a December cut.\u201d \n The next rate decision is Dec. 4. \n \n \n \n WEIGH IN  \n \n \n \n   \n Do you think the Bank of Canada should have cut rates as insurance? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Results \n \n Total Results:  0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t//Set gigya info\n\twindow.gigyaMeta = {\n\t\tsocialPluginsLoaded: false\n\t};\n\n\t// Create gigya Polls object if doesn't exist\n\tif (typeof window.gigyaPolls == 'undefined') {\n\t\twindow.gigyaPolls = {};\n\t}\n\n\t// Add new poll object\n\twindow.gigyaPolls.poll_1_1340128 = {\n\t\t'items': {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'option_0': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'Yes',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, 'option_1': {\n\t\t\t\t'text': 'No',\n\t\t\t\t'count': 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t'totalResponses': 0,\n\t\t'pluginLoaded': false,\n\t\t'isLive': true\n\t};\n \n \n TRADE TENSIONS \n In contrast, the central bank on Wednesday highlighted the impact of trade conflicts and uncertainty on global growth which officials said is hurting business investment, exports and commodity prices, even with global monetary easing. \n The bank lowered its growth forecast for Canada to 1.7 per cent\u00a0next year, from a July estimate of 1.9 per cent, and 1.8 per cent\u00a0in 2021 from a previous projection of two per cent. It also forecast an outright decline in exports and business investment in the second half of this year, when growth is expected to average a sluggish 1.3 per cent. \n As a result, the level of economic output will be \u201cslightly lower\u201d at the end of 2021 than predicted in July. \n Officials also noted \u2014\u00a0in a rare reference to the Canadian dollar in a rate statement \u2014\u00a0that \u201cdespite\u201d lower commodity prices, the currency hasn\u2019t weakened against the U.S. dollar and is actually stronger against other currencies. \n At the same time, the central bank is projecting inflation will remain at the two-per-cent\u00a0target over the projection horizon, in part because of a small downward revision to its estimates for potential growth and expectations the \u201cmodest\u201d output gap \u2014\u00a0primarily in oil-producing regions \u2014\u00a0will narrow. \n Global financial conditions meanwhile have eased, helping offset the impact of growing trade uncertainty, officials said. \n MORE BULLISH \n The Bank of Canada was more bullish on consumption and housing \u2014\u00a0which is being fueled by a robust labour market \u2014\u00a0with forecasts little changed or even higher for those sectors in 2020 and 2021. \n Another source of future growth could be additional stimulus from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s re-elected Liberal government, which has promised to implement new spending and tax cuts next year. \n The Bank of Canada \u201cwill pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy \u2014\u00a0notably consumer spending and housing activity \u2014\u00a0as well as to fiscal policy developments,\u201d policy makers said in the statement. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Outlier status leaves Bank of Canada atop the interest rate heap", "description": "The Bank of Canada is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for an eighth-straight meeting on Wednesday, probably leaving the country with the highest policy rate among the world\u2019s major economies.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/outlier-status-leaves-bank-of-canada-atop-the-interest-rate-heap-1.1339440", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 30, 2019", "content": "The Bank of Canada is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for an eighth-straight meeting on Wednesday, probably leaving the country with the highest policy rate among the world\u2019s major economies. \n All but two of 30 forecasters in a Bloomberg survey see Governor Stephen Poloz maintaining the benchmark overnight rate at 1.75 per cent\u00a0at 10 a.m. in Ottawa. Four hours later, in rare back-to-back decisions for Canada and the U.S., the Federal Reserve is expected to reduce borrowing costs for a third time since June. \n The end result would be a drop in the midpoint of the Fed funds rate, currently at 1.88 per cent, to below Canadian rates for the first time since 2016. If that happens, the Bank of Canada would have the highest policy rate not only in the Group of Seven but across the industrialized world. \n Here are some of the reasons Canadian policy makers are resisting the dovish turn in global monetary policy and adopting a wait-and-see approach. \n \n Underlying price pressure -- as measured by core inflation -- has been stable near the Bank of Canada\u2019s two per cent\u00a0target for well over a year. That\u2019s easily the best the central bank has done in hitting its target over a prolonged period, and reflects an economy running nicely at about its capacity -- neither too hot nor too cold. \n This validates Poloz\u2019s decision to hike rates through 2017 and 2018 to levels that, as recently as September, officials described as stimulative. \n \n Canada\u2019s economy\u00a0surprised analysts\u00a0with a better-than-expected performance in the first half. Annualized growth of just over two per cent\u00a0reflected a strong rebound in exports that probably won\u2019t continue in the second half, but the anticipated slowdown isn\u2019t likely to be severe enough to push output far below capacity, if it all. \n Economists expect growth to slow to 1.5 per cent\u00a0over the next two years, slightly below potential -- one reason some forecasters are calling for at least one rate cut in the next few quarters. \n However, the central bank, which will revise its forecasts Wednesday, has been predicting growth will be slightly above potential over that period, closer to two per cent. \n \n Another reason the central bank can remain on hold is a\u00a0jobs market\u00a0that\u2019s on track for one of its best years on record. Canada has added 358,100 jobs since December, the most in the first nine months of a year since 2002. This isn\u2019t just evidence that workers remain in demand, but also creates a virtuous cycle where employment gains fuel income growth that will boost consumption down the line. \n In fact, were it not for a sharp increase in the immigrant labor force to meet the demand, the country would almost certainly be running up against capacity constraints that would be fueling even sharper increases in wages than currently seen. \n \u201cConditions have held up well enough domestically that the Bank of Canada doesn\u2019t feel they have fallen behind the curve,\u201d said David Tulk, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. \u201cWith there still being a lot of ambiguity on the international front, they can buy as much time as possible to see how all of these inevitably unfold.\u201d \n \n Canada\u2019s housing market, which looked vulnerable earlier this year, has\u00a0stabilized. For that, Poloz can thank falling bond yields globally, which pushed down mortgage rates in Canada and rekindled demand. Essentially, Canada has already had a dose of stimulus. \n It didn\u2019t look good for a while, with home sales hitting a six-year low in February and residential investment tumbling for five straight quarters amid escalating concern about corrections in Toronto and Vancouver. \n That all seems to be forgotten, with healthy signs of recovery in both markets, and even stronger gains elsewhere. Housing investment also rebounded during the spring, and isn\u2019t any longer expected to be a drag on growth. \n \n That said, policy makers will be reluctant to see housing turn into a major driver again. That\u2019s because elevated real estate prices are the main culprit in the country\u2019s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. As Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said in the central bank\u2019s last public statement on monetary policy in September, the Bank of Canada is \u201cmindful of the implications for financial vulnerabilities.\u201d \n --With assistance from\u00a0Erik Hertzberg\u00a0and\u00a0Shelly Hagan. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Susanne Barton", "title": "Loonie vies for G10 currency crown ahead of Bank of Canada decision", "description": "When the Canadian and U.S. central banks announce policy decisions on Oct. 30, traders are betting that the divergent decisions will allow the loonie to blunt the dollar\u2019s status as the highest yielding Group-of-10 currency.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/loonie-vies-for-g10-currency-crown-ahead-of-bank-of-canada-decision-1.1338556", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 28, 2019", "content": "When the Canadian and U.S. central banks announce policy decisions on Oct. 30, traders are betting that the divergent decisions will allow the loonie to blunt the dollar\u2019s status as the highest yielding Group-of-10 currency. \n Futures traders are pricing in almost no probability of a rate cut at the Bank of Canada meeting, while predicting a quarter point reduction from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank has already cut rates twice this year compared to the BOC, which has yet to cut rates since 2015. \n The Fed\u2019s easing is \u201cchipping away at the key element that has provided underlying dollar support, which is that the U.S. has had a substantial carry advantage over pretty much all the G-10 currencies,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank. He expects the BoC to hold rates steady at this meeting, helping maintain the loonie\u2019s strength. \n \n Rate cuts generally push yields lower as will likely be the case in the U.S. Wednesday and correspondingly make Canadian assets look more attractive. \n Canada\u2019s two-year yields climbed above U.S. equivalents earlier this month for the first time since 2017 and loonie bulls are betting that they may have more room to run. The yields are about three basis points higher than U.S. equivalents, amid a flurry of soft U.S. economic\u00a0data, which pressured Treasury rates lower. \n The U.S. has consistently had the highest yields among G-10 currencies in both shorter-term and longer-term government debt for much of the last two years. \n And while the U.S. 10-year yields are still higher than their Canadian counterparts, that gap has narrowed rapidly over the past year. It has tightened to about 25 basis points, the narrowest spread in two years, from a high of 89 basis points in March. \n The Canadian dollar is the best performer this year in the G-10 with a 4.4 per cent\u00a0gain against the greenback.

Pyle is buying Canadian bonds and cutting back on U.S. notes. \n Should the economic data turn, the strength of the loonie could be short lived, Pyle said. \n \n Others are not convinced that the loonie will extend gains. \n \u201cEven though it\u2019s been one of the best performing currencies to now, to be long the CAD and have a significant bullish view on it, has to have as an underlying assumption that the U.S. economy is going to remain very resilient,\u201d said Francesca Fornasari, head of currency solutions at Insight Investment, which has $844 billion in assets under management. \n \u201cThe direction of travel has been toward softer data, rather than stronger data\u201d in the U.S., she added. She is neutral on the Canadian dollar despite the big jump this year. \n The loonie is trading close to a three-month high against the greenback after posting a third straight weekly gain.

That would lower the target range for the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent. \n In addition, 56 per cent\u00a0of respondents said in the event of such a cut, policy makers would telegraph, either in their policy statement or through Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference, that they are likely to pause for some time before making another rate move. \n \u201cIt might well be a hawkish cut as Powell will likely signal some resistance to cut rates more,\u201d said Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva. \n The Fed has already lowered rates twice this year \u2014\u00a0in July and September \u2014\u00a0not because officials forecast a steep downturn but because the risks of such a slump have mounted. Powell last month compared that to taking out \u201cinsurance.\u201d \n Though U.S. unemployment is low, hiring strong and consumer spending solid, he cited slowing global growth, uncertainty around trade tensions and below-target inflation as reasons to nudge rates lower. \n \n THREE AND DONE \n Coming out of this meeting, the big questions will center on whether Powell and other key policy makers believe three, quarter-point cuts represent enough insurance. Even if that is the case, there\u2019s no guarantee Powell will say so. At his September press conference, Powell shied away from providing any signal on future rates despite repeated questioning. \n \u201cThe Fed is refraining from providing forward guidance, saying rate decisions are on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\u201d said Kathleen Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \u201cHowever, if the Fed intends to pause its rate cuts at the December meeting, look for Chair Powell to provide some signal in his press conference.\u201d \n REMAINING UNCERTAINTY \n Not all the economists agreed. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, said he expected no such signal because the uncertainties the Fed has used to justify rate cuts haven\u2019t abated. \n \u201cChina and the U.S. haven\u2019t come to an agreement, Europe is still slow and weak, and Brexit isn\u2019t done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t put a floor under this, because that would argue they\u2019ve already done enough to fix the uncertainty, or that the uncertainty is gone, and it\u2019s not gone.\u201d \n According to their median projections, respondents expect the Fed will lower rates once more in 2020. That\u2019s roughly in line with investors. Pricing in fed funds futures implies an expectation for another roughly 40 basis points in easing by the end of 2020. \n A separate question showed economists nonetheless seeing significant risks to the U.S. economy. As a group they assigned a 30 per cent\u00a0median probability that the Fed will cut rates all the way to zero before the end of next year. \n T-BILL PURCHASES \n Most respondents said they expect the Fed will find sufficient supply in outstanding Treasury bills to execute a new plan aimed at smothering volatility in overnight funding markets. \n The Fed announced Oct. 11 that it would initially buy US$60 billion a month in bills to increase the level of bank reserves. Just under a quarter, however, said the Fed will be forced to add some purchases of coupon-bearing short-dated Treasuries to reach their target. \n AVERAGE INFLATION \n Asked about the Fed\u2019s ongoing policy framework review, just 11 per cent\u00a0said they expect the Fed will formally adopt an inflation-targeting strategy known as average-inflation targeting. A much larger group of 43 per cent\u00a0said officials will instead alter the language in their annual policy strategy statement to include a reference to hitting their inflation target on average. Another 22 per cent\u00a0said officials will drop the fixed-point inflation target for a range. \n The Fed has failed for most of the last eight years to bring inflation up to its two-per-cent\u00a0objective. Officials have contemplated a new policy that would require overshooting the target for some time to make up for periods of undershooting. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Sveinung Sleire", "title": "Norway sticks with decision to pause hikes; warns of weak krone", "description": "Norway\u2019s central bank reiterated its view that interest rates will remain at the current level in the \u201ccoming period,\u201d but said that an historically weak krone poses an inflation risk.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/norway-sticks-with-decision-to-pause-hikes-warns-of-weak-krone-1.1336667", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 24, 2019", "content": "Norway\u2019s central bank reiterated its view that interest rates will remain at the current level in the \u201ccoming period,\u201d but said that an historically weak krone poses an inflation risk. \n \u201cThe upturn in the Norwegian economy is continuing broadly in line with expectations in September.

Powell described the move as providing insurance against risks threatening the economic outlook. \n Rate Path \n Projections on the best future path for rates, also released after that meeting, showed policy makers were divided. Five thought it was a mistake to cut rates, five agreed with the reduction and thought that would be enough this year, and seven favored another decrease by December. \n The minutes again reflected concern over slowing global growth and uncertainty created by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes. \n Participants showed increased concern about such risks, as well as geopolitical threats, judging that related uncertainty would continue to affect business investment spending. \n \u201cSeveral participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption,\u201d the record of the gathering said. \n Officials agreed consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace and household spending was likely to hold up, while several said the housing sector was starting to rebound as mortgage rates fell. \n Nonetheless, several also noted that statistical models designed to gauge the probability of a recession over the medium term had increased notably in recent months. \n Soft Data \n Economic data released since the meeting has been softer. Closely watched reports on manufacturing, services and payrolls all came in weaker than expected, though hiring was still enough to push the U.S. jobless rate down to a half-century low of 3.5 per cent. \n Powell sounded non-committal Tuesday on the need for another cut in October, describing the economic outlook as \u201cfavorable\u2019\u2019 but threatened by risks connected to trade and slowing global growth. \n \u201cThe next FOMC meeting is several weeks away, and we will be carefully monitoring incoming information,\u2019\u2019 he said in Denver. \u201cWe will act as appropriate to support continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation moving back to our symmetric 2 per cent objective.\u201d \n The FOMC also discussed recent turmoil in overnight money markets, where a sudden lender shortage caused rates to spike higher, and briefly pushed the benchmark federal funds rate above the Fed\u2019s target range. \n Permanent Fix \n The strain forced the Fed to intervene with temporary injections of liquidity for the first time in a decade to tamp down rates. The committee discussed a more permanent version of that program. \n \u201cSeveral participants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a standing repurchase agreement facility as part of the framework for implementing monetary policy,\u201d the minutes said. \n Critics linked the turmoil with the reduction in the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which they said left the system with insufficient bank reserves to cushion the market from periods of higher cash demand or lower supply. \n Powell said Tuesday the central bank will resume growing its balance sheet via new asset purchases, probably Treasury bills, to insure a sufficient quantity of reserves. He also stressed the move was to solve \u201ctechnical issues\u2019\u2019 and shouldn't be confused with crisis-era large-scale bond buying, also called quantitative easing, designed to stimulate the economy. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Anirban Nag", "title": "India cuts rates fifth time amid economic slowdown, banking woes", "description": "India\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate for a fifth straight time this year, moving aggressively to revive economic growth as the banking system faces new stresses.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/india-cuts-rates-fifth-time-amid-economic-slowdown-banking-woes-1.1326387", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 4, 2019", "content": "India\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate for a fifth straight time this year, moving aggressively to revive economic growth as the banking system faces new stresses. \n The Reserve Bank of India lowered its benchmark repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5.15 per cent\u00a0on Friday.

In the euro area, regulators are trying to push market participants away from the traditional Euribor and Eonia measures. \n By some measures, the euro area has lagged behind other regions in the\u00a0shift\u00a0from the much-maligned older benchmarks. U.S. companies have been selling debt linked to the new American reference rate for nearly a year and in the U.K., financial markets have begun to decisively migrate to a sterling overnight rate index. \n The good news is that the move to ESTR may be helped by the ECB\u2019s strategy for switching from the former benchmark rate. \n \u201cThe transition to ESTR should be pretty straightforward given Eonia will now be computed as a tracker off this new rate,\u201d said Adam Kurpiel, a strategist at Societe Generale SA. \u201cEuro money-market derivatives will also benefit from all the Eonia infrastructure. It should be much smoother than in the U.S. where new markets had to be created from scratch\u201d for their new benchmark -- the\u00a0secured overnight financing rate. \n The inauguration of the new rate follows ECB\u2019s years of preparation including the release of pre-ESTR data starting March 2017 through mid-September of this year. \n Here\u2019s how it works: \n - ESTR rate published daily 7 a.m. London time for previous day \n - European Money Markets Institute (EMMI) publishes Eonia using the new methodology at about 8:15 a.m. London time \n - Eonia to be set at\u00a0ESTR plus\u00a0a fixed 8.5 basis points \n - Eonia will be discontinued on Jan. 3, 2022 \n ESTR is already starting to gain traction with Germany\u2019s L-Bank this month pricing the first sale of syndicated notes tied to the ECB\u2019s new benchmark. Daily trading volumes in pre-ESTR have averaged about 37 billion euros (US$40 billion), with the rate staying mostly at about five basis points below the ECB\u2019s depo rate, according to UniCredit SpA. \n The European Investment Bank may price on Wednesday a three-year floating-rate note linked to ESTR, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about it. \n The ESTR results suggest the ECB\u2019s deposit-rate cut last month -- by 10 basis points to minus 0.50 per cent -- is being passed on in full through the banking system. The ESTR reading released Wednesday was in line with an estimate for -0.55 per cent from Christoph Rieger, head of rates strategy at Commerzbank AG. \n \u2018Unknown Issue\u2019 \n ESTR is a bank borrowing rate that relies on individual daily transactions. That compares with Eonia, a lending rate administered by EMMI that relies on voluntary contributions by banks. ESTR is a volume-weighted trimmed mean of overnight transactions. Counterparties include about 50 of the\u00a0largest euro-area banks\u00a0spread across 10 countries. \n The fixing for Oct. 1 was based on a volume of almost 36 billion euros completed between 32 banks in 432 transactions, the ECB said. The share of volume from the five largest banks was 54 per cent. \n It\u2019s not clear if the ECB\u2019s recent move to apply negative rates differently among various banks, known as tiering, will affect ESTR. Tiering comes into effect on Oct. 30. \n \u201cBecause ESTR is calculated as a trimmed mean, the impact of new flows will depend on their size relative to the volume of transactions that are eligible to calculate ESTR,\u201d said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit, in a note Monday. \u201cOne unknown issue is whether these new bids will go on top of existing ones or will crowd out less attractive bids.\u201d \n --With assistance from\u00a0Yuko Takeo\u00a0and\u00a0Piotr Skolimowski \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "After best rally since 2000, Canadian stocks face a wall of worry", "description": "The best start to the year since 2000 for Canada\u2019s stock market brought a surge of superlatives -- fresh highs and record profit forecasts.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/after-best-rally-since-2000-canadian-stocks-face-a-wall-of-worry-1.1324622", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Oct 1, 2019", "content": "The best start to the year since 2000 for Canada\u2019s stock market brought a surge of superlatives -- fresh highs and record profit forecasts. \n Yet, expectations for the rest of the year are nowhere as rosy as the rally seen in the first quarter.

Both have previously said they don\u2019t expect to have to turn to bond buying and other alternative measures, as they wait and gauge the success of existing stimulus. \n \n Another Boom? \n Lowe executed cuts in June and July that have helped house prices rebound in Sydney and Melbourne, with data today showing national values rose the most since March 2017 last month. At the same time, a windfall from commodity prices is ongoing as iron ore futures hold close to a still-high US$90. \n The RBA\u2019s cuts mean more cash for households, many of which are also receiving tax rebates from the government. That\u2019s in an economy already set to benefit from infrastructure spending and higher mining investment, as well as a depreciating currency that\u2019s helping exporters. \n Lowe is scheduled to speak at the RBA board dinner later Tuesday, at 7.20 p.m. in Melbourne. There will be no Q&A session. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Christopher Condon", "title": "Powell in position to overcome divisions seen in Fed\u2019s dot plot", "description": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d of interest-rate projections shows plenty of disagreement among central bankers over where monetary policy should go in the next three months.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/powell-in-position-to-overcome-divisions-seen-in-fed-s-dot-plot-1.1322564", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 26, 2019", "content": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d of interest-rate projections shows plenty of disagreement among central bankers over where monetary policy should go in the next three months. \n That doesn\u2019t mean Chairman Jerome Powell will have trouble corralling his colleagues into a another cut in 2019, if that\u2019s ultimately what he wants. \n \u201cThe dot plot is a very, very imperfect way to understand what\u2019s going on in the committee,\u201d said Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed and now an economics professor at the University of Rochester. Engineering another 2019 cut \u201cis well within Powell\u2019s ability if he were inclined to make it happen.\u201d \n The Fed published its latest dot plot on Sept. 18, the same day officials cut rates for a second time this year. It showed seven of the 17-member Federal Open Market Committee favored even lower borrowing costs by year-end. The remaining 10 indicated the Fed had either reduced rates enough or had already cut too much. The division suggests resistance to further decreases might prove formidable when the FOMC gathers in October and again in December. \n A look behind the dots, plus an understanding of the dynamic underlying FOMC voting, suggests otherwise. \n For starters, the group of seven looking for another cut clearly included St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari, the most consistently dovish members of the committee in recent months. Bullard, who even favored a half-point decrease in September, votes this year, so if Powell is convinced there\u2019s a need for another reduction he\u2019s got one supporter in the bag among regional presidents. \n It\u2019s also important to consider the pressure on policy makers to show a united front behind Powell. \n According to Vincent Reinhart, a former senior staff economist at the Fed, there\u2019s an understanding within the central bank that officials should form a consensus around any policy decision, and that any dissent is essentially a rebuke of the chair. \n Regional presidents, who run their own institutions with deep research departments, can more easily resist that pressure than Fed governors if they feel strongly about their policy position. Powell has seen six dissents from regional presidents in just the last three meetings. But a dissent from a Fed governor is far rarer -- there hasn\u2019t been one since 2005 -- and would signal a more serious division. \n Same Floor \n \u201cIt\u2019s tougher if you\u2019re a governor because you work on the same floor, you rely on the chair for committee assignments and access to staff,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIt also means you couldn\u2019t convince the chair of your view. You\u2019re not in the in-club, and as a governor you should be in the in-club.\u201d \n Like the governors, New York Fed President John Williams also has a permanent vote. He\u2019s viewed as occupying a spot in the inner core of FOMC decision making, alongside Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida. A Williams dissent would make big headlines and undermine Powell\u2019s credibility, making it very unlikely. \n As a result, the governors, plus Williams, can safely be viewed as a single voting bloc, no matter where their dots fell in September. \n \u201cDots may diverge, votes will converge,\u201d said Carl Riccadonna, chief U.S. economist at Bloomberg Economics. \n That means Powell, if he ends up wanting to cut rates again, could open either of the next two FOMC meeting with seven votes, including his own, already in his pocket: the five Fed governors, plus Williams and Bullard. \n Evans Vote \n Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, a 2019 voter, could be an eighth despite his revelation this week that his dot implies no further cutting this year. He\u2019s viewed as especially dovish over below-target inflation, so if inflation doesn\u2019t rise as he predicts, he could revert. That might leave the two remaining voters, Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren and Kansas City\u2019s Esther George as the only hawkish dissenters for the third time this year. \n It would still be awkward should all the remaining, non-voting presidents line their December dots up with Rosengren and George to reveal a 9-8 split on the committee. But that\u2019s also unlikely. \n Powell could probably persuade a few more of his colleagues to lower their 2019 dots, starting with Dallas chief Robert Kaplan, who told reporters on Sept. 20 that he didn\u2019t favor more rate cuts this year but was \u201copen minded.\u201d Atlanta\u2019s Raphael Bostic and San Francisco\u2019s Mary Daly, assuming neither is already in the bottom seven, might also prove accommodating. \n So when it comes to predicting the FOMC\u2019s next move, instead of looking for swing voters on the FOMC it\u2019s probably more important to focus on the key policy makers. \n \u201cAs a Fed watcher, I\u2019m listening to Clarida, I\u2019m listening to Williams and I\u2019m listening to Powell,\u201d said Kocherlakota, who\u2019s also a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. \u201cThe dot plot is fun, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that meaningful.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Michelle Zadikian", "title": "Lower rates giving Canadian housing 'nine lives': CIBC's Tal", "description": "If the Canadian housing market had a spirit animal, a cat could be fitting.", "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/lower-rates-giving-canadian-housing-nine-lives-cibc-s-tal-1.1319445", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "Sep 20, 2019", "content": "If the Canadian housing market had a spirit animal, a cat could be fitting. \n Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, says global and domestic developments that have led to lower interest rates have continually buoyed Canadian housing at times when it was poised to soften. \n \u201cThe housing market has nine lives.

Norway will spend the equivalent of almost eight per cent\u00a0of GDP this year to plug a budget shortfall. Against that backdrop, unemployment has stayed below 4% and inflation is above target. \n \u201cThe policy rate forecast indicates a slightly smaller rate rise than in the June Report. Weaker growth prospects and lower interest rates abroad have contributed to the downward revision. Slightly lower inflation and a somewhat less tight domestic labor market compared with the June projections have also pulled down the rate path. A weaker-than-projected krone has in isolation pulled up the policy rate path. With a policy rate in line with the forecast, inflation is projected to remain close to the inflation target in the years ahead, at the same time as unemployment remains low. The policy rate path will be adjusted in response to a change in economic prospects or the balance of risks.\u201d \n Olsen has avoided unconventional policies, such as negative rates and asset purchases, and instead opted for a strategy he calls \u201cleaning against the wind\u201d to fight financial imbalances. Recent gains in the price of oil and a persistently weak Norwegian krone underpin the central bank\u2019s commitment to tightening. \n"}]
