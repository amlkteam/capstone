Last names will not be used. \n \n Leaving job due to closures  \n Brooke in Penticton, B.C.: \n When my workplace had to close its doors due to the COVID-19 situation in my university town, they sent out forms from the Canadian government saying to sign your name if you agree that this is a temporary layoff and will, within the next five months, come back to work for the business if and when they need me. \n However, I could not sign it because I had to move back home since the university shut down and I couldn\u2019t live there anymore while paying for groceries when I didn\u2019t have work. So for me to sit around and wait for them to be able to re-open again was not an option. \n Therefore, me signing that means legally I quit. But I did not quit because I didn\u2019t want to work there. I didn\u2019t sign because I won\u2019t be around in the next five months because I had to move home due to COVID-19. \n Now the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) requirements say you aren\u2019t eligible if you voluntarily quit your job, but there are certain reasons that are exempted like if you had to quit to take care of a loved one who is sick from COVID-19, or if you yourself are sick. It also says that reasons to stop working are not limited to these specific COVID-19 reasons. \n Would I still be eligible? I could not sign the temporary layoff because I had to move back to my family home and away from the business I worked at due to COVID-19. \n Also, eligibility was expanded to seasonal workers. Every summer I have a job at a beach restaurant, and of course it is not opening. Does this count as a seasonal work?

I did receive in 2019 over $5,000 in wages. I also worked enough hours to qualify for employment Insurance (EI) which I did, and it ran out on February 19, 2020. \n So my question is, does being retired and collecting a pension once a month disqualify me from being eligible for the CERB?

Pension income - CPP, OAS - they\u2019re not considered employment income for the purposes of the CERB so you are eligible to apply.

With so much debt created from the pandemic, what will the government do? Will this create high inflation like in the 70s? (April 17, 2020) \n Beata Caranci, chief economist and senior vice president of TD Bank Group: \n Relative to the size of the economy, government spending is roughly six times the amount that was offered during the global financial crisis. However, the economic contraction is also deeper than recent historical experiences. \n The government has oriented funds towards temporary measures that will naturally expire if the economy avoids a prolonged recession. This, along with a recovery in tax receipts, would help stabilize debt-to-GDP levels, provided the government can resist turning temporary measures into permanent ones. \n In an optimistic scenario, where the economy begins to reopen within the next month, it will likely take a year or more for Canadian activity to return to pre-crisis levels. The job market is less likely to fully recover. This leaves the balance of inflation risks to the downside due to a demand gap. In a less optimistic scenario that takes the economy upwards of two years or more to recover to pre-crisis levels, downward pressure on inflation will build and governments will have to spend even more on income stabilizers, leaving deficit fighting for another day (and generation).

Would this be the time for seniors to apply for the Chip Reverse Mortgage? (April 18, 2020) \n Rob McLister, founder of RateSpy.com: \n Reverse mortgages are meant for seniors who want to stay in their home, need cash and have no better options. \n Assuming you genuinely need the money and are willing to pay reverse mortgage rates to get it, step one is to rule out all other options. Those might include downsizing, getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC), finding a renter or roommate, selling other assets, selling your home to loved ones at a below-market price with a leaseback agreement, and so on. \n Barring alternatives, a reverse mortgage is an easy source of fast liquidity. But don\u2019t tie yourself to one lender. Compare both HomeEquity Bank (founder of CHIP) to Equitable Bank, its much newer competitor. The former will lend you more money with less restrictions, but generally has higher rates. The latter lends less money, as a percentage of your home value, but has lower rates and fees. As we speak, the best reverse mortgage rates will save you 1.25 percentage points of interest annually. That means $15,500 less interest on a $200,000 lump-sum reverse mortgage over five years.

Last year I worked at McDonald\u2019s part-time as I was a full-time student. Then I graduated in November and applied for a post-graduation work permit since at the time I was not eligible to work.

They are accepting only mail application for SIN numbers, which takes one month, so I want to know if am eligible because I am meeting all other conditions.

Now the delay in getting your SIN renewed likely is not going to meet the eligibility for the CERB, which was designed to help Canadians who were working and directly impacted COVID-19 and unable to work and seen a reduction in your income and/or hours. \n And so in this case, you weren\u2019t working prior to COVID-19 and will likely not qualify for the CERB. But the good news is, it sounds like you got you\u2019ve got your paperwork on the go and likely just maybe a week or two away from getting your SIN renewed, and it also sounds like your employer has an opportunity waiting for you. \n So I wish you the best with that and one thing that I do suggest is you go onto the CERB website. Things are changing so rapidly, the government is continuously implementing new programs to help Canadians and things get updated regularly so stay informed, check out the website. Good luck!

But I still have to pay overhead charges like rental, insurance and some interest to the bank. \n I also work another job which I am still able to carry on as it is more IT-based. Because of the job, I am not able to qualify for the CERB. \n Can you please advise what would be the way forward for me? Should I close my business permanently? I am not able to pay my bills. (April 22, 2020) \n Barry Choi, personal finance blogger for Moneywehave.com: \n The prime minister just announced Ottawa may propose a Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses that will lower your rent by 75 per cent for April, May and June. To qualify, your rent must be less than $50,000 a month. In addition, you must have ceased operations or seen your income drop by 70 per cent compared to pre-COVID-19 income. The government is working with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to cover 50 per cent of the rent, your landlord would cover 25 per cent and you would be responsible for the remaining 25 per cent. \n If the program goes through, it will be available in mid-May, so talk to your landlord if this will help you keep your business operating. That said, if the outstanding rent, insurance and other overhead costs are eating into your cash flow, it might make sense to cut your losses and close your business.

Then in early March, the Bank of Canada followed the U.S. Federal Reserve in slashing rates by 50 basis points, and then did so again in mid-March and added another taper at the end of the month. \n \"What we saw in the past, let's just say three weeks, was a unprecedented accumulative drop in that key rate of over one and a half per cent,\" said Toma Sojonky, a mortgage adviser in Vancouver. \n The key central bank rate cut, which has pushed the prime rate from 3.95 per cent to 2.45 per cent, has made variable rates lower and mortgages more affordable. \n \"This could be good news for one element of the Canadians' pocketbook, but it's reflective of what of course is going on economically,\" said Sojonky. \n Banks haven't passed on the full reduction of the prime rate in variable mortgages though because of the economic uncertainty and concerns about their liquidity, or the amount of money they have to lend out, as Canadians deposit fewer paycheques. \n \"Banks are at risk to have liquidity and potentially insolvency, and so banks have to maintain a percentage of liquidity or cash,\" said Sojonky. \n The increasingly cloudy economic picture that has pushed the prime rate down has also led banks to reverse their cuts to fixed rates and instead push them up, even to levels that were higher than when the crisis began, as banks become more cautious about lending and liquidity. \n Rising fixed rates as prime rates fall is unusual, and reflective of how much uncertainty banks have on the direction of the economy, said James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca and president of CanWise Financial. \n \"They don't have a good feeling for how sharp the economic downturn is going to be, what our unemployment rate will get to, how quickly will we bounce back from it. So they're building a higher risk premium into this fixed rate than what you would see during more usual times.\" \n Fixed rates could look more attractive when the world gets the pandemic under control, and the challenge becomes a more straightforward economic one, said Laird. \n \"The more we get into a regular recession, which people understand, you can expect that risk premium to disappear from fixed rates.\" \n But if borrowers think that the crisis will be protracted, then they should probably stick with variable rates for now, he said. \n \"If they think it's going to be long and they think we're going to get into a deep recession here, variable rate is the way to go because it will stay very low while we are in this mess.\" \n Because variable rates are now generally lower than fixed rates, a switch from the situation for the past year, Sojonky recommends those shopping for new mortgage or renewing one to go for a variable rate. \n The option also has the advantage of having generally lower penalties than fixed-rate mortgages for breaking a mortgage, which quite a few Canadians end up doing, said Sojonky. \n Variable-rate mortgage holders should then watch the market closely for changes in the outlook, or develop a good relation with a broker, to be ready to lock in a fixed rate if things change quickly. \n \"The good thing about variable rate mortgages is their optionality. And that as a fallback, Canadians have the option of locking into a fixed rate term.\" \r\n\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada despite virus-relief cuts", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mortgage-rates-are-rising-in-canada-despite-virus-relief-cuts-1.1414766", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 30, 2020", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up -- even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. \n That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers. \n \u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201d \n The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month. \n As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well. \n But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com. \n \n \n \n RELATED  \n  Mortgage market sees flurry of activity amid low rates, virus uncertainty \n Mortgage rates rise despite the Bank of Canada rate cuts: Mortgage Broker   \n \n \n  Toronto real estate sales plunge as virus weighs on market: Realtor \n \n \n \n Funding Costs \n Typical five-year fixed rates at also rising.

Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they\u2019re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points. \n McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said. \n Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper. \n \u201cThe banks just can\u2019t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,\u201d Cooper said. \n She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year. \n \u201cI believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Michelle Zadikian", "title": "Mortgage market sees flurry of activity amid low rates, virus uncertainty", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mortgage-market-sees-flurry-of-activity-amid-low-rates-virus-uncertainty-1.1412984", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 27, 2020", "content": "A perfect storm of lower interest rates, widespread layoffs and economic uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak has sent the mortgage finance market into overdrive. \n \u201cThere\u2019s mass requests for refinancing.

At least a modest one to start. First, keep in mind that Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal are all either hot or getting hotter, and these changes will hit right as the spring selling season gets underway. \n Arguably, the impact will be as much on prices as unit demand.

The stress test is used to ensure that Canadians can afford their mortgage payments if interest rates rise in the future. \n \u201cCanadians who are getting insured and insurable mortgages can expect to qualify for a little bit more than what they can today,\u201d James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub.ca, said in a statement. \n The Bank of Canada five-year benchmark posted mortgage rate has typically been about two percentage points higher than the average five-year fixed contract rate for insured mortgages, the government said. The government said that rate has not been as responsive recently to changes in the average mortgage contract rates. \n The test, then, didn't adjust to recent drops in lending interest rates and became too tight, Sherry Cooper, chief economist of Dominion Lending Centres wrote in a note. \n \u201cWith rates falling sharply in recent weeks, especially since the coronavirus scare, the gap between posted and contract mortgage rates has widened even more than what was already evident in the past two years,\u201d she wrote. \n The Bank of Canada five-year benchmark posted mortgage rate is currently 5.19 per cent, while the special offer rate advertised on the Royal Bank's website for a five-year fixed-rate mortgage is 3.09 per cent and rates offered by smaller lenders are even lower. \n The change should make qualification incrementally easier for some buyers, but still leaves too onerous a test for many given the economic realities of a low-rate environment, said Paul Taylor, president of Mortgage Professionals Canada. \n \u201cHaving a stress-test at 200 basis points to prepare people for a potentially more expensive renewal just doesn't seem practical,\u201d Taylor said in an interview. \n \u201cIf you really want to prepare people for a two-per-cent increase in interest rates, then a 75 basis point test today will do that.\u201d \n The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions is also considering using the same new stress test rate for uninsured mortgages. \n OSFI has been using a minimum qualifying rate of the greater of the contractual mortgage rate plus two percentage points or the five-year benchmark rate published by the Bank of Canada. \n OSFI, which is consulting with stakeholders, has proposed that it will also adopt the new benchmark rate on April 6 to coincide with the changes for insured mortgages. \n The lockstep move should avoid creating an imbalance in the marketplace, Taylor said. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "TD markets first RMBS from a top-six Canadian bank", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/td-markets-first-rmbs-from-a-top-six-canadian-bank-1.1389782", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 13, 2020", "content": "A unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank is moving ahead with what would be the first widely-marketed Canadian private-label residential mortgage-backed securities deal from one of the country\u2019s six largest banks, according DBRS Morningstar. \n The transaction will be backed by a $688.3 million pool of home loans that were originated by three smaller lenders, according to a DBRS Morningstar document. TD Securities plans to offer $450 million of top-rated securities with an expected maturity around Feb. 2023, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. It will be a milestone in creating a market to help disperse housing debt risk. \n The last RMBS deal widely marketed in Canadian dollars was conducted by a Home Capital subsidiary in September, when it issued $425 million of securities that pooled near-prime and alternative-A mortgages. The weighted-average borrower credit score of that deal was 741, while that of TD\u2019s Prime Structured Mortgage Trust will be 793, according DBRS Morningstar, which rated both deals. \n \u201cThe mortgage pool compares favorably with recent issuances seen in the Canadian market in terms of credit-score characteristics,\u201d rating company analysts including Tim O\u2019Neil wrote in the Feb. 11 report. \n A nationwide roadshow is taking place this week before the deal books are opened, so definitive terms still have to be set, people familiar with the matter said. The deal will be the first RMBS in Canada to aggregate mortgages originated by other lenders, mimicking a technique used in the securitization of mortgages guaranteed by the federal agency known as Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, DBRS Morningstar said in an email to Bloomberg News. \n The volume of residential mortgages in Canada increased 5.1 per cent\u00a0in the twelve months through Nov. 30, according to data compiled by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI. That\u2019s more than three times the country\u2019s GDP growth in 2019. Uninsured mortgages grew 12 per cent\u00a0to $759.4 billion. In contrast, insured loans declined 4.6 per cent\u00a0to $469.5 billion over the same period, as the Federal government has sought in recent years to limit taxpayer exposure to the real estate sector. \n Lenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and expected return, and there\u2019s been little evidence that risky mortgages have become a prominent feature in Canada\u2019s RMBS market. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property. \n With a securitization deal the seller of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital needed to be set aside to cover potential losses should they meet certain conditions, which includes transferring significant credit risk to third parties. The seller would need to hold capital for any securitization tranches retained. \n TD Securities will offer only the safest portion of the transaction, specifically the bullet-pay class A notes, retaining the mezzanine and junior pieces, a person familiar with the matter said. Back in 2017, Bank of Montreal created a $1.96-billion RMBS deal, though much of the securities were purchased and retained by the bank itself, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said at that time. \n The Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of bond-market professionals, has been working for around two years to expand interest in RMBS. Part of their efforts include a proposed public mortgage database, the details of which would be ironed out by a working group co-chaired by the central bank, the CMHC, representatives from the six largest banks and the Canadian Bankers Association on behalf of the smaller players, according to a presentation given in October. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "TD Bank lowers its posted five-year fixed mortgage rate", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/td-bank-lowers-its-posted-five-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-1.1384692", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 4, 2020", "content": "TORONTO -- TD Bank lowered its posted five-year fixed mortgage rate on Tuesday to narrow the gap between the benchmark and the special rates it offers customers. \n Banks maintain an official posted rate, but also offer lower rates either directly or through brokers and other channels that better reflect market conditions. \n TD  cut its five-year posted rate for fixed-rate mortgages  from 5.34 per cent to 4.99 per cent, while the bank's customer, or \"special\" rate stands at 3.09 per cent, or 3.11 per cent with annual carrying fees included. \n \"Based on current market conditions, lower funding costs have led to a growing variance in customer rates versus posted rates,\" said bank spokeswoman Ana Aujla by email. \n \"This rate decrease aligns TD's 5-year fixed posted rate more closely with current customer rates.\" \n The posted rate is significant for the federal mortgage stress test, which is based on the posted rates at the big Canadian banks. The posted rate is also used for calculating mortgage penalties. \n Sherry Cooper, chief economist of Dominion Lending Centres, said the TD decrease was welcome news, even if it didn't go far enough, as posted rates by the big banks are making it harder for people to qualify for a mortgage. \n \"By keeping posted rates too high, the Big-Six banks have inflated the qualifying rate, making it more difficult than necessary to pass the stress test to get a mortgage.\" \n She noted that if some other big banks follow TD, it could push the qualifying rate for the new B-20 mortgage rules below five per cent for the first time since they were implemented in January 2018. \n Posted rates at Canada's other big banks remain somewhat elevated, including several at 5.19 per cent after a cut last year, but they often follow one another in mortgage rate movements. \n Cooper noted that if the stress test rate dropped from its current 5.19 per cent to 4.99 per cent it would require roughly 1.8 per cent less income to qualify for the average Canadian home price. \n TD's rate drop comes after the five-year government bond yield, which helps determine mortgage rates, has declined from 1.70 per cent in mid-December to 1.34 Monday, in part on economic fears around the coronavirus. \n The rate also saw a steady decline for much of last year before a late rebound. The five-year bond yield dropped from 1.93 per cent in January last year to 1.13 in September on several factors including U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, pushing mortgage rates lower and helping boost real estate sales in the latter half of the year. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Pattie Lovett-Reid: 2020 may be a watershed year for indebted Canadians", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pattie-lovett-reid-2020-may-be-a-watershed-year-for-indebted-canadians-1.1359669", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Dec 9, 2019", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Pattie Lovett-Reid\n                             \n Chief Financial Commentator, CTV   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Debt levels are climbing and so are delinquency levels. \n That\u2019s according to TransUnion Canada\u2019s latest report, which is not to be cheered. It revealed Monday that outstanding credit card balances have passed the $100-billion mark for the first time as Canadians continue to borrow and rack up the debt amid historically-low interest rates. \n Now, for the most part, Canadians continue to manage their payments. However, we need to pay special attention to one particular data point. A very real warning sign that is ringing the alarm bells for me is non-mortgage delinquency rates, which increased by nearly 26 basis points year over year to 5.54 per cent in the third quarter, according to TransUnion. While this number isn\u2019t ridiculously high, it\u2019s climbing. \n Past reports from TransUnion have shown when Canadian consumers\u00a0are faced with economic pressure, or feel financially distressed with credit cards, auto loans and mortgage payments, they will generally miss their credit card payment first, and keep up their good standing on other payments if forced to choose. \n Here is why I believe that choice happens. When drowning in debt or feeling financially stressed, there can be a desire to maintain your car payments so you can get to and from work or look for a job. And the belief is you will do everything you can to keep a roof over your head. So the default choice becomes the easy choice. \n Many experts have been warning of defaults, and 2020 could be the year we start to see this happen. \n One observation from TransUnion is the mortgage market is starting to show signs of a ticking higher as many have bought into lower rates for a longer period. Add to this, we are seeing imbalances on the supply and demand of the housing market. \n After stalling under the new mortgage regulations over the past year, we could see housing gain momentum in 2020. For now, the silver lining in the report is mortgage originations were up 4.5 per cent in the third quarter and average mortgage balances increased only modestly, up 1.3 per cent. \n Finally, as pressure mounts in the oil-producing provinces, delinquencies in Alberta and Saskatchewan run the risk escalating. According to TransUnion, some regions could experience a delinquency rate increase of up to 50 basis points. \n Households are acutely aware of how much debt they are carrying, and have expressed time and again how stressed they are about this situation. It is my thought that 2020 could be a watershed year for some households that ignore the signs they are living too close to margin. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "CMHC reports annual pace of housing starts slowed to 201,973 in October", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cmhc-reports-annual-pace-of-housing-starts-slowed-to-201-973-in-october-1.1345246", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Nov 8, 2019", "content": "OTTAWA -- Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says the annual pace of housing starts fell in October as the pace of new construction of apartment, townhouse, condo and other types of multiple-unit housing projects slowed. \n The national housing agency says the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts last month slowed to 201,973 units in October compared with 221,135 in September. \n Economists had expected an annual pace of 221,200 for October, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv. \n The decline came as the pace of urban starts fell 9.0 per cent.

The CMHC declined to comment Monday, saying they were not in a position to comment on political parties' promises or announcements during the election period. \n A TD report released earlier this year estimated home prices could rise six per cent by the end of next year if the stress test was removed and all else remained equal. \n Canadian realtors cheered the proposal. \n \"Realtors have long asked for common-sense solutions designed to help Canadians purchase a home of their own,\" said Jason Stephen, The Canadian Real Estate Association's president, adding Scheer's campaign promises include some of their suggested policy changes. \n The Scheer plan also includes launching an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector, as well as making surplus federal real estate available for development to increase housing supply. \n The supply issue is one the two professors were in favour of addressing, as increased supply tends to better affordability. \n \"There's no magic bullet on housing,\" said Somerville. \n Canadians' high level of household debt has been a concern. The CMHC previously warned that high debt levels with looming interest rate hikes could lead to lower consumption, less savings or loan defaults. \n Canadians owed roughly $1.77 in credit market debt -- a figure that includes consumer credit, mortgages and non-mortgage loans -- for every dollar of their disposable income, according to Statistic Canada's most recent figures. \n \"If we're concerned about Canadians' level of debt, why are we helping them take on more debt?\" asked Somerville. \n To call these strategies a pure win for first-time buyers, would ignore the feedback into housing prices, said Thomas Davidoff, a professor at UBC's Sauder School of Business. \n \"In certain markets, ignoring that -- I think -- is a mistake.\" \n Davidoff also believes another issue is how much risk taxpayers should put themselves in. \n The Liberal party's plan, by contrast, provides less risk for taxpayers, he said. \n Liberal leader Justin Trudeau announced earlier this month his party would expand a recently launched program aimed at helping first-time home buyers lower their monthly payments through a shared-equity mortgage with CMHC. The expansion would boost the maximum qualifying price of a home in Victoria, Vancouver and the Toronto region from about $500,000 to nearly $800,000. \n \"There's an element of subsidy there,\" Davidoff said, adding that means taxpayers are not getting a great financial deal. But, the risk is lower because a borrower can't default on equity if interest rates rise or they lose their income, like they can on the payments for their mortgage. \n Andrew Pavlov, a professor at Simon Fraser University's Beedie School of Business, supported the implementation of the stress test and scaling back mortgage amortization terms when both changes happened. \n \"Today the situation is very different,\" he said. \n Federal governments made those changes to prepare borrowers and the financial system for looming interest rate increases at the time, said Pavlov, but now \"there's virtually no possibility of interest rate increases\" with declines expected instead. \n In flat or declining housing markets, which many Canadian cities have become thanks partly to a host of government intervention measures, there's a case for relaxing mortgage borrowing rules, he said. \n If house prices decline substantially, defaults will start to occur and put the financial system at risk, Pavlov said. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Realtor groups call on federal parties to ease mortgage rules", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/realtor-groups-call-on-federal-parties-to-ease-mortgage-rules-1.1315274", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Sep 12, 2019", "content": "TORONTO \u2014 Real estate associations representing nearly three-quarters of the realtors in Canada have called for federal parties to commit to ease mortgage rules as the election campaign gets underway. \n Organizations representing realtors and brokers in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec and Nova Scotia say too much regulation makes ownership unaffordable. \n With the federal election set for Oct. 21, the boards and associations have urged federal political parties to commit to revise the mortgage stress test and adapt it to regional differences and changing economic trends. \n The stress test, made more stringent in 2018 to cool an overheated housing market, requires would-be borrowers to show they could still make payments if faced with higher interest rates or less income. \n The associations also want the $750 First-Time Home Buyers Tax Credit replaced with a $2,500 non-refundable tax credit for first-time buyers and are seeking reintroduction of 30-year mortgage amortizations. \n Industry groups have been calling for eased rules around home buying for some time, while the CEO of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has urged the federal government to keep the rules in place to protect the economy from tragic consequences as debt levels soar. \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Oliver Telling", "title": "Negative mortgages set another milestone in no-rate world", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/negative-mortgages-set-another-milestone-in-no-rate-world-1.1303272", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Aug 19, 2019", "content": "The world\u2019s headlong dash to zero or negative interest rates just passed another milestone: Homebuyers in Denmark effectively are being paid to take out 10-year mortgages. \n Jyske Bank A/S, Denmark\u2019s third-largest lender,  announced in early August  a mortgage rate of -0.5 per cent, before fees. Nordea Bank Abp, meanwhile, is offering 30-year mortgages at annual interest of 0.5 per cent, and\u00a020-year loans\u00a0at zero. \n Years of easing by central banks hacked away at interest rates around the world, distorting the traditional economics of lending and borrowing. This is most pronounced in Europe, where a composite home-loan rate across the euro area fell to 1.65 per cent in June, the lowest since records began in 2000. \n While some regions have resisted the trend, borrowing costs are at or near rock-bottom in many major world markets. That\u2019s boosted demand from homebuyers and spurred fierce competition among lenders for their business. \n Here\u2019s a snapshot of mortgage rates around the world: \n U.S. \n The average American 30-year mortgage rate is 3.6 per cent, the lowest since November 2016. A resulting surge in demand for homes sent total mortgage debt to US$9.41 trillion in the second quarter, surpassing the peak reached during the 2008 financial crisis. Mortgage brokers, too, are\u00a0rushing\u00a0to keep up with demand for refinancing: Applications are\u00a0running\u00a0at a three-year high. \n The benefits for home buyers are\u00a0muted\u00a0in cities such as New York and San Francisco, however, because the boom has led to a shortage of affordable homes. \n France \n French mortgage rates reached a trough of 1.39 per cent on average in June, according to Bank of France data. The country\u2019s banking industry is extremely competitive: Many lenders have jockeyed to lure customers with cheaper offers. \n Germany \n German mortgage rates also reached historic lows this year, with the average 10-year loan currently under 1 per cent. Some lenders are offering rates around 0.5 per cent, according to Interhyp, a comparison website. \n The prospect of further declines in benchmark borrowing costs could drive many mortgage rates toward zero. This may have a limited impact on the residential market, however -- only 46 per cent of Germans are homeowners, compared with an EU average of 69 per cent. \n \n U.K. \n Mortgage rates in the U.K., by contrast, have been\u00a0almost unchanged\u00a0this year, despite a drop in overall borrowing costs amid a worsening economic outlook. The rate on a two-year fixed mortgage fell just 8 basis points from January to July, compared with a 38 basis-point drop in two-year swaps. \n One reason for this, says Mark Gilbert of Bloomberg Opinion, is that the Bank of England\u2019s regulatory arm has\u00a0discouraged lenders\u00a0from trying to win market share by easing standards because it\u2019s concerned about their financial strength. \n Hungary \n Mortgage costs are fairly high in Hungary because regulators steered almost all borrowers away from cheaper (but less secure) floating-rate loans. A 10-year fixed-rate mortgage is currently around 5 per cent, compared with money-market rates near zero. \n The attraction of security was heightened by memories of a fashion for mortgages taken out in Swiss francs before the financial crisis. The subsequent plunge in the forint against the franc hammered as many as 1 million Hungarians. \n Greece \n Mortgage rates have actually risen in Greece, burdened by sovereign and corporate debts. The average floating-rate home loan was 3.08 per cent in June, an increase of 11 basis points from a year earlier. \n Greek banks\u2019 mountain of soured loans means they have become wary of extending new credit, even when secured by a house. \n Hong Kong \n Mortgage rates are also climbing in Hong Kong as the\u00a0political crisis\u00a0weakens the appetite for loans. Both HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc increased effective rates by 10 basis points to 2.48 per cent in July, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \n Singapore \n DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Singapore\u2019s largest bank, is offering a three-year fixed-rate mortgage at 1.89 per cent in the first year, rising to 2.18 per cent in the second and third years. Floating-rate loans are set at about 1.13 per cent above deposit rates. \n Loan-to-value limits for mortgages were tightened last year to prick an incipient property bubble. Residential home prices have been recovering as foreign buyers return to the market, with private home sales jumping to the highest level in eight months in July. \n Japan \n The Bank of Japan\u2019s negative-rate policy has kept home loans affordable. A 10-year fixed-rate mortgage can be had for about 0.65 per cent, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank offers a rate as low as 0.53 per cent. \n This has spurred property purchases, and prices, in the larger cities, helping reverse years of decline following the bursting of the market bubble in 1991. Residential land prices in the greater Tokyo area rose 1.3 per cent last year, while those outside major urban areas increased 0.2 per cent, the first rebound in 27 years. Nationwide, though, prices stand at just 38 per cent of their 1991 levels, according to the Land Ministry. \n Australia \n Mortgage rates have fallen about 40 basis points following the Australian central bank\u2019s back-to-back interest rate cuts in June and July. The average standard variable rate at the nation\u2019s big four lenders is currently 4.94 per cent. \n The decline in mortgage rates, along with an easing of lending rules and the surprise re-election of the center-right government, has fired up Australia\u2019s housing market. Following a two-year slide, property prices in Sydney have risen over the past two months. \n South Africa \n The cost of a home loan remains relatively high in South Africa. Banks\u2019 prime lending rate is about 10 per cent, and mortgage borrowers can expect to pay anywhere from two percentage points below that rate to five points above it. \n While banks are starting to extend more loans to compete for market share, mortgage rates are unlikely to drop much. Inflation is generally high, and the central bank has held its benchmark rate above 6 per cent since 2015. \n Nigeria \n Nigeria has had double-digit inflation since 2016, with mortgage rates to match -- as high as 30 per cent. Those who contribute a small percentage of their income to the state-owned bank can get a much better 9 per cent rate from the National Housing Fund. \n Mortgage uptake is low because of high rates, low incomes and a long wait for government-backed loans. \n --With assistance from\u00a0Patrick Clark,\u00a0Andrew Blackman,\u00a0Geraldine Amiel,\u00a0Marton Eder,\u00a0Sotiris Nikas,\u00a0Taiga Uranaka,\u00a0Peter Vercoe,\u00a0Gordon Bell,\u00a0Anthony Osae-Brown\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus Wright. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Frances Schwartzkopff", "title": "20-year mortgages hit zero for first time in Danish rate history", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/20-year-mortgages-hit-zero-for-first-time-in-danish-rate-history-1.1298311", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Aug 7, 2019", "content": "In Denmark\u2019s US$495 billion mortgage-backed covered bond market, another milestone was reached on Wednesday as Nordea Bank Abp said it will start offering 20-year fixed-rate loans that charge no interest. \n The development follows an announcement earlier in the week by Jyske Bank A/S, which said it will start issuing 10-year mortgages at a coupon of minus 0.5 per cent.

He pointed out how gross household debt has increased to $2.2 trillion or to 178 per cent of income last year, from $539 billion, or 106 per cent of household income in 1998, posing serious potential consequences to the economy. \n On the stress test for mortgage renewals, which only apply when borrowers want to switch lenders, Hudak argues the requirement limits competition and so makes mortgage payments less affordable. \n Siddall said the renewal rule, implemented by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, aims to prevent competition among banks for weaker credit, and effectively requires lenders to support their existing customers through a crisis. \n Hudak also sought to rebuff the direct criticism Siddall levelled at OREA and other real estate associations as having \"plain self-interest\" in lobbying for measures that would raise home prices. \n \"In his letter, Mr. Siddall also claimed we have bad motives for advancing our policy recommendations, and he has done this even more pointedly in other forums,\" wrote Hudak. \n \"We believe that our observations and recommendations are supported by solid evidence and reasoning.\" \r\n\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "April Fong", "title": "Feds should assess housing 'broadly,' revisit mortgage rules: ATB CEO", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/feds-should-assess-housing-broadly-revisit-mortgage-rules-atb-ceo-1.1285964", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jul 11, 2019", "content": "The chief executive of Alberta-based bank ATB Financial is calling on the federal government to revisit controversial mortgage rules introduced in January 2018, saying\u00a0the regulations are holding back some Canadians from buying homes. \n Curtis Stange, president and CEO of ATB, said the government needs to look at what\u2019s happening across Canada\u00a0 \u2013 and beyond the provinces with higher-growth housing markets.\u00a0 \n \u201cWe believe the federal government and regulators still need to listen Canadians broadly and continue to look especially at the component of the 200-basis point stress test,\u201d Stange told BNN Bloomberg\u2019s Greg Bonnell Thursday. \n \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the increase in interest rates, on top of the 200-basis point stress test, are making it difficult for some Canadians who would normally be able to get into a home, [to purchase] a home.\u201d \n Stange joins a number of realtors and home-builder groups who have urged the government to revisit the B-20 rules in recent months.

And yet for many, there still continues to be a cloud of uncertainty surrounding the major expense. \n You find yourself asking: Fixed or variable? Am I getting the best rate possible? What if I want to re-negotiate my mortgage, make a prepayment or anything else that might pop up? Not understanding the details of your mortgage could cost you thousands of dollars unnecessarily each year. \n According to LowestRates.ca, close to 40 per cent of Canadians surveyed didn\u2019t know that bank mortgages are negotiable. Clearly, the banks aren\u2019t about to advertise this fact; however, never lose sight that they do want share of your wallet. And if you are a good-standing customer with other products and services, you are likely will get a better deal than the posted rate if you ask for it. \n Here are a few questions to ask your banker when doing a little mortgage shopping: \n 1. Is the rate you're quoting me the lowest I can possibly get, given my track record as a customer and my mortgage preferences? \n 2. If I find a lower rate for a similar product elsewhere, will you match it? \n 3. How long will the you hold my rate for? \n 4. What are the penalties if I want to re-negotiate my mortgage should rates go lower? \n 5. How much and when can I make extra payments each year? \n These are important questions given your mortgage payment can eat up a large portion of your monthly living costs. You owe it to yourself to secure the lowest mortgage rate possible, and that requires doing a little homework, asking the tough questions, and standing up for yourself. \n Ratehub.ca reminds us that like shopping for a car or a plane ticket, there is also a \u201cbest time of year\u201d to secure a mortgage. Based on historical data, the best five-year fixed and variable rates are between April and July. In other words \u2013 right now. The second most competitive time frame occurs between October and December. \n One last thought: Securing the mortgage isn\u2019t always just about the rate. It is key, but there may be other bells and whistles that you need to consider such as portability, amortization, renewal strategies and extra costs such as processing and legal fees. Once again, a little due diligence can lead to huge cost savings. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "'We're still vulnerable': CMHC CEO's candid housing Q&A", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/we-re-still-vulnerable-cmhc-ceo-s-candid-housing-q-a-1.1256276", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "May 9, 2019", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n The president and chief executive of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is warning in no uncertain terms that Canadians need to change their perception of home ownership as a savings vehicle.

Expectations...have backed off, that's true for sure. Part of that is in response to policy actions that people may think are more important than they are.\" \n On choosing the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive to address affordability \n \"We looked at a bunch of different options [in the lead-up to the federal budget].

The First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, was the answer, [and] will have \u2013 we think \u2013 an insignificant impact on prices.\" \n On the biggest vulnerability in the housing market \n \"It is still indebtedness; indebtedness among young people because people tend to default when they lose their job within the first or second year of a mortgage.

Should I move to Abbotsford?' Well, if they invest in housing, they don't have to do that.\" \n On criticism of the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive \n \"[The policy] is deliberately designed to be a surgical response to people being excluded from the market. And so, because it's a marginal program, and people are being excluded at the margin, it's targeted right there. And if it were much larger, it would have an inflationary effect.\" \n On homeownership ambitions in Canada \n \"In places like Paris, and Sydney, and Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, [and New York], people rent. Whereas here, we glorify homeownership. And we think it's the only vehicle for savings. Well, that's looking at the last 100 years. And, unfortunately, savings are in the future, not in the past. And I think this party ultimately comes to an end, and the people who are going to get hurt are young people.\" \n On the role of the banks \n \"We looked at lender risk sharing a number of years ago as a way to implicate them. It turns out that idea has been shelved for a while. And the truth is, we have a bit of an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand solution in Canada. Mortgage insurance makes our system more resilient. It means that if there is a housing correction, our banks will be somewhat insulated from that. On the other hand, it takes them out of the game. They're in there a little bit; they have to have capital aside for some of those mortgages. I would like, but I haven't found the magic bullet, to actually implicate lenders.\" \n On interest-only mortgage payments \n \"That is a concern, yeah. Amortizing mortgages are mortgages that build up equity in themselves.

David Wilkes, chief executive officer at the Building Industry and Land Development Association, says the stress test needs to be changed to reflect those higher borrowing costs. \n Wilkes also says one of the unintended consequences of the rule changes is that they\u2019re driving home buyers into secondary markets where rates are often much higher. \u201cWithout those changes, we are going to continue to see a dampening of demand,\u201d Wilkes said in a telephone interview. \n The federal government has the opportunity in its upcoming budget to make changes, such as extending amortization periods, Wilkes said. It could also use \u201cmoral suasion\u201d to encourage lenders to look at longer mortgage terms, so rather than the standard 5-year term, they could offer 7-year or 10-year terms, similar to what\u2019s available in other markets, Wilkes said. \n Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who\u2019s preparing his budget ahead of an election in October, said this month the government is looking at ways to make homes more affordable for younger buyers. Carolyn Rogers, Osfi deputy superintendent, is due to speak Tuesday in Toronto about the stress tests. \n \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that there\u2019ll be some sort of a reduction to the stress test,\" Taylor said. \"But I\u2019m also nervous that they will create some sort of overly complex tax rebate system specifically for first time buyers that won\u2019t assist them at all.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canadian banks on notice with mortgage growth at 17-year low", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-banks-on-notice-with-mortgage-growth-at-17-year-low-1.1209283", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 5, 2019", "content": "Mortgage growth has shrunk to a 17-year low in Canada, increasing pressure on the country\u2019s big banks to find business elsewhere. \n Residential mortgage growth rose 3.1 per cent to $1.55 trillion\u00a0in December from a year earlier, the slowest pace since May 2001, and half the growth rate from two years ago, according to data from the Bank of Canada. \n \u201cThe bread-and-butter of profitability for Canadian banks \u2014\u00a0is going to have a little less butter on the bread,\" said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones & Co., whose firm oversees $30.8 billion in Canada. \u201cThat is, in many cases, the largest and most profitable and steady of the businesses that these banks operate.\" \n Investors will need to \u201crecalibrate\u201d their expectations in what is arguably one of the most important trends in the industry in years, Fehr said in a phone interview. \u201cThe banks that will do best are the ones that do have other levers to pull.\u201d\u2019 \n Government efforts to rein in household debt, including tougher mortgage-qualifying standards, have dramatically cooled the housing market in the past year.

It\u2019s late in the day, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it is all over right now. There was precious little upside room left in the market (as epitomized by the S&P 500), and indeed, that index came within 3 per cent of our measured intrinsic value (3,075) just before it began to set back. Right now, I would expect that there should be a meaningful low at about 2,550 for the S&P, which is two and a half times its adjusted book value; in times past, that particular value in our methodology has served (and served powerfully) as resistance on the upside in rising markets and support on the downside for falling markets. \n The \u201cTwilight\u201d in Twilight Zone implies that it\u2019s getting close to the end of the day (or the bull market), but further, it also implies that misty and even mysterious things can happen, like in the TV series. Investors can become overly excited about certain stocks and send them far beyond any realistic values which are supportable by their true fundamentals. The FAANG stocks and Bitcoin come to mind. Right now, cannabis is all the rage. Just look at the uptake of the stuff in Colorado after 10 years of being legalized for a reality check. (In the meantime, have fun if you can withstand the risks). \n My own guess \u2013 and it\u2019s a guess because the market values are generally fairly poor \u2013 is that, like in the market peaks in 2000 and earlier in 1973, there will be many good opportunities to trade in this market for a while, but \u201cinvesting\u201d is now a thing of the past from an overall market perspective. We all know that President Trump will be leaning on the Fed to act if there\u2019s serious market weakness, so how weak can markets get in the shorter term? \n Longer term the market underpinnings, notably in the U.S., are weakening as U.S. corporations in particular take on more and more leverage due to those nice low interest rates.

His war on his trading partners (and anyone else who he doesn\u2019t happen to like at the moment) has served to weaken the currency values of Trump\u2019s target countries (and economic zones) and strengthen the U.S. dollar (although that is the one side effect that Trump doesn\u2019t want). For the time being at least, however, he\u2019s stuck with the currency effects of his policies and the U.S. dollar has been quite strong. The question is: Is Trump winning the economic war or is this a temporary condition which carries the seeds of its own demise? \n The Trump trade wars against friends and foes alike are like all wars: no one really \u201cwins\u201d and in the end, everyone suffers in one way or the other. The balance sheet impact for the U.S. is what I\u2019m most interested in \u2013 as in the longer run that is what really drives currency values \u2013 and the impact of Trump\u2019s actions especially his tax cut policies and the economics of trade wars, are especially likely to be harsh in this regard. \n In the shorter term, this is likely to be lost in Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the fallout of his policy moves. I have no market \u201csell\u201d signal in sight, so I must presume that markets can move higher.

it\u2019s currently a good time to buy a home in their community. Homebuyer sentiment fell to a neutral level this spring, dropping from consistently positive attitudes prior to 2016. \n Declines in housing prices are also raising doubts on the reliability of the overall housing market, \u201ccausing some prospective buyers to fear that values will fall further,\u201d the report\u2019s author, Will Dunning, chief economist of Mortgage Professionals Canada, said in a release. \n The industry association\u00a0also warned in its report that weakening sentiment is affecting some housing markets unnecessarily, noting that prices are showing \u201csome erosion\u201d in markets including Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, which are still recovering from lower oil prices. \n \u201cThis is one of the greatest economic risks facing Canada \u2013 that local economic weakness combined with the deliberate suppression of housing demand via the mortgage stress tests could result \u2013 unnecessarily \u2013 in falling house prices in some areas of the country,\u201d the report said. \n In June, the Bank of Canada said in its Financial System Review that stricter mortgage rules have helped ease elevated consumer debt and slow price gains for single-family homes in Vancouver and Toronto.\u00a0 \n \"The vulnerability related to high household indebtedness has begun to ease.

They have the ability to match this rate and still make money.\" \n TD spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo says its special five-year variable rate applies to new and renewed mortgages, as well as the variable rate term portion of certain TD home equity lines of credit. \n \"We are confident this is a strong offer for new and renewing customers, while ensuring we remain competitive in a changing environment,\" Bellissimo said in an emailed statement. \n The moves come amid slowing mortgage growth. The Canadian Real Estate Association said Tuesday that national home sales volume sank to the lowest level in more than five years in April, falling by 13.9 per cent from the same month last year. The national average sale price decreased by 11.3 per cent year-over-year. \n Home sales have slowed due to various factors, including measures introduced by the Ontario and B.C. governments to cool the housing market, such as taxes on non-resident buyers. \n Other headwinds for mortgage growth include higher interest rates and a new financial stress test that makes it more difficult for would-be homebuyers to qualify with federally regulated lenders, such as the banks. \n As of Jan. 1, buyers who don't need mortgage insurance must prove they can make payments at a qualifying rate of the greater of two percentage points higher than the contractual mortgage rate or the central bank's five-year benchmark rate. An existing stress test also stipulates that homebuyers with less than a 20 per cent down payment seeking an insured mortgage must qualify at the central bank's benchmark five-year mortgage rate. \n The tighter lending rules are making it harder for homebuyers to qualify for uninsured mortgages, and shrinking the pool of qualified buyers for higher-priced homes, CREA's chief economist Gregory Klump said in April. \n Meanwhile, Canada's largest lenders all raised their benchmark posted five-year fixed mortgage rates in recent weeks as government bond yields increased, signalling a rise in borrowing costs. \n In turn, the central bank's five year benchmark qualifying rate -- which is calculated using the posted rates at the Big Six banks -- increased last week to 5.34 per cent. This qualifying rate is used in stress tests for both insured and uninsured mortgages, and an increase means that the bar is now even higher for borrowers to qualify. \n As well, since July, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times to 1.25 per cent, putting added pressure on consumers. But a rising interest rate environment also means that the margins -- or profit made on loans -- on mortgages for banks will improve if interest rates rise. Rising interest rates also drive up demand for fixed-rate mortgages, and banks may discount variable mortgage rates in an effort to balance the books, according to McLister. \u200b \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "Bank of Canada raises conventional 5-year mortgage rate", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bank-of-canada-raises-conventional-5-year-mortgage-rate-1.1074400", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "May 9, 2018", "content": "TORONTO -- The bar is now higher for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages in Canada after the central bank raised a key metric used in stress tests that determine borrowers' eligibility. \n The Bank of Canada raised the conventional five-year mortgage rate from 5.14 per cent to 5.34 per cent after all Big Six banks raised their posted five-year fixed mortgage rates in recent weeks. \n The central bank qualifying rate is separate from the actual mortgage rates offered by banks to borrowers, but is used to assess homebuyers who are seeking loans. \n Homebuyers with less than a 20 per cent down payment seeking an insured mortgage must qualify at the central bank's benchmark five-year mortgage rate. \n And as of Jan. 1, buyers who don't need mortgage insurance are required to prove they can handle payments at a qualifying rate of the greater of the central bank's five-year benchmark rate or two percentage points higher than the contractual mortgage rate. \n \"Mortgage borrowers will be qualifying for less than they were able to earlier this year,\" mortgage broker Samantha Brookes said in an email. \"With all the new rule changes, we've definitely noticed the effect on the market with home purchases, renewals and refinances.\" \n The higher rates come as an estimated 47 per cent of all existing mortgages will need to be refinanced in 2018, up from the 25 to 35 per cent range in a typical year, according to a recent CIBC Capital Markets report. \n The increase is an unintended consequence of various rounds of regulatory changes in the past few years aimed at reducing risk coupled with rising house prices that made it harder for homebuyers to qualify. \n Borrowers who find the bar too high for the home they want can make some adjustments in order to make a purchase, she said. Those options include purchasing a smaller home and taking on less mortgage, or purchasing where prices are lower, added Brookes, who is founder of Mortgages of Canada. \n The jump in the mortgage qualifying rate comes after Canada's largest lenders raised their benchmark posted five-year fixed mortgage rates in recent weeks as the cost of borrowing rises. \n In late April, TD Bank was the first of the Big Five lenders to raise the benchmark rate, increasing it from 5.14 per cent to 5.59 per cent, due to factors including the \"competitive landscape, the cost of lending and managing risk.\" Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and the Bank of Nova Scotia followed suit, but with smaller increases. \n The slew of bank moves was preceded by a rise in government bond yields. The yield on the Government of Canada benchmark five-year bond was 2.16 per cent on Tuesday, compared to 1.01 per cent a year earlier.

Bloomberg's Doug Alexander explains. \n \n Grauman said there are a number of factors which are driving these increases, including higher funding costs. \n \"There's that element which motivates the banks to raise the rates at which they charge their clients,\" he said. \"But you also have competitive dynamics as well that are at play.\" \n At the same time, several of Canada's biggest banks have cut their posted variable mortgage rates, which are more directly tied to changes in the Bank of Canada's interest rate. \n BMO is now offering a five-year variable closed mortgage rate of 2.45 per cent until the end of May. \n \"Our five year variable rate is reflective of the competitive environment and is a great rate for customers seeking a variable mortgage,\" said a BMO spokesperson in an emailed statement. \n \"Customers that choose this product can also renew to a fixed rate mortgage with the same or longer term at any time with no fees.\" \n RBC late last month said it will reduce its offered rate for a five-year variable closed mortgage to 3.3 per cent from 3.45 per cent. \n TD Bank last month cut its five-year variable closed rate offering for new and renewed mortgages earlier this month to 2.85 per cent which is 75 basis points less than its prime rate. Previously it was 2.95 per cent. \n McLister said in a rising rate environment, banks are inundated with demand for fixed rates and these discounts in part reflect banks' efforts to balance their books. \n As well, the margins -- or profit made on loans -- on variable rate mortgages will improve if interest rates rise, he added. \n Still, the difference between mortgage rates banks offer and their funding costs for a given term, known as the spread, is shrinking, McLister said. \n \"This is true for both fixed-rate mortgages and variable rates,\" he said in an email. \n \"In short, banks are accepting less profit as competition gets more aggressive for the fewer and smaller prime mortgages that now exist.\" \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Personal Investor: The mortgage market is getting ugly", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/personal-investor-the-mortgage-market-is-getting-ugly-1.1074027", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "May 9, 2018", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Dale Jackson\n                             \n Personal Finance Columnist, Payback Time   Follow | Archive \n \n \n In just a matter of months the burden of borrowing to own a home has multiplied. \n The big banks have hiked their posted benchmark five-year fixed mortgage rates to well over five per cent.

He\u2019s sounding the alarm as rising interest rates and stricter borrowing rules threaten to squeeze households even further. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its benchmark rate twice more this year and it\u2019s next decision is April 18. \n CREDIT RELIEF\u00a0 \n Hannah\u2019s colleagues dubbed him \u201cDr. Debt\u201d after he received an honorary degree in 2012 from University Canada West, a private business school, for his \u201cdistinguished service in the field of credit counseling.\u201d Prior to establishing the non-profit, registered charity in 1996, he worked for 11 years at Equifax Canada, a credit reporting company, but decided \u201ca nice title and a good salary doesn\u2019t make you happy,\u201d so he left to find something that \u201cmade a difference.\u201d \n He found it by helping people get relief from their creditors. As Hannah tells it, during the early 1990s, the provincial debtor assistance program in British Columbia was cutting back just as bankruptcy rates were rising. A group of banks, credit unions and department stores tried and failed to establish a complementary service. Hannah offered to raise the necessary funds, so long as he was allowed to run the organization. \n DROP IN THE BUCKET\u00a0 \n Twenty-one years later, the society -- with offices from the provincial capital in Victoria to Ottawa -- has assisted more than half a million people. The average client is 43 years old, has $31,000 in outstanding debt and seven creditors. More than half are female. Average gross monthly income is $5,200, and housing costs consume 42 per cent of their net income. The society\u2019s clients repaid $51 million last year, up about 6 per cent. \n It\u2019s still a drop in the bucket. \n Canadian household credit totaled a record $2.13 trillion at the end of February, roughly doubling since 2006, central bank data show. Residential mortgages account for 72 per cent of that. The rest includes credit cards, lines of credit and auto loans. \n People carrying large debt loads still feel ahead of the game because home prices keep rising, Hannah said. \u201cWhat happens when the economy has a downturn, like in Alberta. We know what happened. We\u2019re still seeing the impact of that,\u201d he said, adding people in the oil-rich province were \u201ccaught off guard, and because of a lack of savings, many people lost their homes, had to sell their assets and start over again.\u201d \n Some observers argue Canada\u2019s household debt isn\u2019t a problem because asset ratios and home equity levels are also high and the country\u2019s labor market is strong. A report from the Canadian Banker\u2019s Association this week showed the national mortgage arrears rate through January was 0.24 per cent, close to the lowest in three decades. \n Hannah doesn\u2019t buy it. Low arrears and delinquency rates \u201cdon\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d because a robust housing market is masking financial strains, he said. \u201cIf a person\u2019s had difficulty keeping up with the mortgage payment, it\u2019s been relatively easy just to sell your home,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cWhat happens though when you have a tight market and it\u2019s not as easy to sell your home?

Shopping for a mortgage based solely on the lowest rate. The mortgage with the lowest rate isn't always the best mortgage. There are other factors to consider like prepayment privileges, penalties and portability. \n 2. Not taking the time to read the fine print. By not reading your mortgage, you could find yourself trapped in a collateral mortgage, or a mortgage with hefty penalties if you end up breaking it early. \n 3. Not getting pre-approved for a mortgage. You'd be surprised to hear how many people make an offer without getting pre-approved first. Doing this can be disastrous. \n 4. Failing to review your credit report and credit score ahead of time. If you're thinking about buying a home, it's a good idea to review your credit score and credit report six months to a year ahead of time. That way you'll have plenty of time to fix an error on your credit report or improve your credit score if it's lower than you anticipated. \n 5. Failing to shop around at renewal. While most of us shop around when we first sign up for our mortgage, far too many of us simply sign the renewal papers without making the same effort. Your lender may not be giving you its best offer, so see what else is out there. \n Not everyone can realistically pay off their mortgage in three years, but who doesn\u2019t want to pay it down sooner rather than later?\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Allison McNeely and Greg Quinn", "title": "Bank of America said to explore Canada's uninsured MBS market", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bank-of-america-said-to-explore-canada-s-uninsured-mbs-market-1.991009", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 7, 2018", "content": "Bank of America Corp.

It was also considering discussing the sale of the securities with U.S. investors, according to a government memo from June obtained through a records request. \n Bank of America declined to comment through a spokeswoman. \n The firm is the latest to consider selling these securities after the nation\u2019s regulators made it harder for consumers to qualify for government insurance on mortgages. The new rules, and others that followed, were meant to reduce demand in Canada\u2019s stretched housing market by making it harder for individuals to borrow. They also cut the government\u2019s risk. \n \u2018Unique Position\u2019 \n The impact from the rule changes on home prices, mortgage-credit growth, consumer behavior, and mortgage funding may not appear until at least the second half of 2018, Sanjay Narine, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in a Jan. 29 report. \n \u201cThe market is in a unique position and offers an opportunity for all participants to \u2018get it right\u2019 and preserve gains, maintain competition, and foster a private-label RMBS market that is a deep, liquid, and sustainable,\u201d he said. \n Banks may be looking at this market, but for now it\u2019s tiny. There are two offerings outstanding: around US$200 million\u00a0of the securities from a 2014 sale by alternative lender MCAP Corp. and a small portion of the bonds backed by US$2 billion of uninsured mortgages from Bank of Montreal issued last year. \n Transactions Pulled \n Previous efforts to kick-start a market for bonds backed by uninsured home loans have stalled as investors remain concerned about over-valuation in Toronto and Vancouver\u2019s housing markets and record consumer debt levels. Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada sounded investor interest last year in two separate deals. \n The transactions didn\u2019t go ahead after regulators said\u00a0mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. failed to properly disclose possible loan-application fraud, leading to a liquidity crisis and emergency bailout by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \n The market for bonds backed by government insured home loans is much bigger. There are some US$463 billion of the bonds known as National Housing Act securities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been selling them since 2005. \n Even so, there\u2019s a growing number of possible borrowers. About three-quarters of the new mortgages created by federally regulated banks last year didn\u2019t have government support, according to a recent Bank of Canada report. Nearly 50 per cent of the US$1.5 trillion in outstanding mortgages in Canada are uninsured, thanks to the tighter rules. \n The measures are showing some signs of cooling the housing market, too. Sales in Toronto, Canada\u2019s biggest city, plunged 22 per cent in January. \n A security backed by uninsured mortgages will need to offer higher yields than government-insured residential mortgage bonds -- perhaps as much as a half percentage point more, the S&P report said. Disclosure of the actual mortgages in the collateral pool would improve pricing for issuers, the report said. Broadening the investor base to the U.S. would also help pricing, the government memo said. \n Home Capital Chief Financial Officer Brad Kotush said in a recent statement that the lender would consider becoming involved in the uninsured mortgage-backed securities market if the opportunity made sense for its funding strategy. \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": "Armina Ligaya", "title": "New mortgage rules sending borrowers to alternative lenders", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/new-mortgage-rules-sending-borrowers-to-alternative-lenders-1.988399", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 5, 2018", "content": "TORONTO -- Mortgage brokers say the borrower rejection rate from large banks and traditional monoline mortgage lenders has gone up as much as 20 per cent after Canada's banking regulator imposed a new stress test for home buyers who don't need mortgage insurance. \n As a result, alternative lenders are seeing an uptick in business as brokers increasingly direct home buyers toward borrowing options that are beyond the reach of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions' newly enacted tighter lending requirements. \n Clients who don't meet the bar are turning to private lenders, mortgage investment corporations (MICs) and credit unions, which are provincially regulated and not required to implement the stress test, said Carmen Campagnaro, president of Pro Funds Mortgages in Burlington, Ont. \n Campagnaro is one of the brokers who said rejected loan applications to traditional lenders have risen by 20 per cent since Jan.1, when OSFI mandated a new stress test for uninsured borrowers, or those who have more than a 20 per cent down payment. \n Private lender Fisgard Asset Management Corporation in Victoria is seeing an influx of borrowers and \"better quality business\" said Hali Noble, its senior vice president of residential mortgage investments and broker relations. \n \"A lot of these people should be bankable,\" said Noble. \"But they're not.\" \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \n READ MORE: CANADA'S HOUSING MARKET  \n  \u2018Still early days\u2019: Toronto housing braces for full impact of stress tests  \n  Once-hot Toronto housing now has buyers 'sitting on sidelines' as lending rules bite \n  Toronto housing \u2018nowhere as good\u2019 as it needs to be: Mayor John Tory  \n \n \n \n The guidelines, known as B20, are aimed at curbing risky lending amid rising household indebtedness and high home prices in some markets. \n In order to get a loan from a federally regulated lender, home buyers have to prove that they can service their uninsured mortgage at a qualifying rate of the greater of the contractual mortgage rate plus two percentage point or the five-year benchmark rate published by the Bank of Canada. An existing stress test already requires those with insured mortgages to qualify at the Bank of Canada benchmark five-year mortgage rule. \n Superintendent Jeremy Rudin has said OSFI is aware the stricter rules could have unintended consequences, such as sending borrowers towards more risky lenders that are out of the regulator's purview. \n \"We can't control what we can't control,\" he said in October. \n \"Our mandate is focused on the safety and soundness of the federally regulated institutions... It isn't something that we favour but it isn't something that we have an authority to prevent.\" \n Since the revised mortgage guidelines came into force, both the Bank of Canada of rate and benchmark rate has risen, dealing a \"double extra whammy\" to borrowers, said Dave Teixeira, vice president of operations, public relations and communications for Dominion Lending Centres. \n Dominion mortgage brokers are seeing a higher rate of rejection and clients have to submit multiple applications to various institutions before finding a lender that works, he added. \n In turn, their brokers are submitting 80 per cent more applications than last year, Teixeira said. \n \"Normally, we would see our volume going to the big banks and monolines, and now we're seeing a little bit more of that, roughly up to 20 per cent... moving over to credit unions.\" \n However, some credit unions have voluntarily implemented the new stress test or tightened their own requirements. \n Quebec credit union Desjardins Group has been applying OSFI's new mortgage rules in full since Jan. 1. \n \"We believe it represents an effective way to protect consumers against interest rates variations,\" said Desjardins spokeswoman Valerie Lamarre. \n Vancouver-based Vancity Credit Union has voluntarily increased the stress test its members must meet to qualify for a mortgage. \n Rick Sielski, Vancity's senior vice president of risk, would not disclose the mechanics of the stress test and said it was too early to gauge the impact of the new guidelines. \n \"What we're really trying to do is make sure we're serving our market, serving our members in a responsible way,\" he said. \n The higher bar for borrowers is also shifting business to riskier lenders. \n Harold Gerstel, better known as Harold the Mortgage Closer from his television ads, said his Toronto-based mortgage arm is seeing an influx as well. \n \"We're definitely getting more business. Whether it's a substantial change, it's too early to tell,\" he said. \n The new rules are sending better quality demand down the credit line, said Robert McLister, a mortgage planner at IntelliMortgage and the founder of RateSpy.com. \n \"The demand is shifting down the ladder, so you have these less regulated lenders with higher risk tolerance now seeing materially more business. And they can charge more, and they can be pickier with the types of borrowers that they lend to.\" \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": null, "title": "CMHC shuffles management as CFO Zielonka leaves", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cmhc-shuffles-management-as-cfo-zielonka-leaves-1.968943", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jan 15, 2018", "content": "Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. replaced Chief Financial Officer Wojo Zielonka and shuffled its leadership ranks to \u201cbetter address current and emerging business needs.\u201d \n The government-backed mortgage insurer made changes to its leadership team to ensure it continues to meet its business objectives and the housing needs of Canadians, Audrey-Anne Coulombe, spokeswoman for CMHC, said in an email to Bloomberg on Monday. \u201cMany of our leaders have been asked to take on redefined roles.\" \n Lisa Williams, who was previously in charge of multi-unit insurance, replaces Zielonka, who has left the agency.

The activity, the team determined, was a breach of provincial law - by brokers for recommending Olympia Trust Co, and by Olympia for operating without an Ontario license. \n The compliance officers sent their findings to FSCO investigators and later recommended that Olympia be ordered to stop operating in Canada\u2019s most populous province, according to the sources and documents. \n FSCO\u2019s investigators did nothing. Their boss, Executive Director for Licensing and Market Conduct Anatol Monid, decided in May 2015 that there was not enough evidence to proceed, the documents show. \n That decision was part of a larger, more troubling pattern: From 2011 to 2015, Reuters has found, senior FSCO investigators rejected or ignored compliance officers\u2019 multiple recommendations that the agency investigate or take action to rein in the marketing and sales of Fortress syndicated mortgages. \n Since then, growing investor outcry about the products has focused public and government attention on FSCO\u2019s lax regulation of the market. In the past decade, more than 20,000 retail investors have put as much as $1.5 billion\u00a0into syndicated mortgages, mostly in Ontario, according to regulatory sources. Roughly 90 per cent of those investments, the sources said, have ended in a loss or are at risk of doing so, and Fortress projects make up more than half of the investments. \n The documents seen by Reuters, supported by interviews with 10 sources familiar with FSCO\u2019s activities, show that the agency didn\u2019t merely miss the problem; its senior investigators ignored or downplayed clear warnings from within their own ranks that retail investors were being sucked into a market to which they were ill-suited. \n \n \n As yield-hungry savers were pouring their money into the investments to profit from Ontario\u2019s red-hot real estate market, FSCO compliance staff opened at least 17 Fortress-related investigations, according to the sources and internal FSCO documents. \n In at least 10 of those cases, FSCO staff found possible breaches of Ontario law that they felt warranted action. The breaches included misleading marketing, selling products unsuited to clients\u2019 risk tolerance, and failure to disclose the risks and costs of the investments, among other infractions. And in all but one case, FSCO\u2019s investigators either overruled or ignored the recommendations. \n Why the FSCO investigation team repeatedly declined to pursue recommended investigations isn't clear. Current and former FSCO staff said the investigators, most of them former police officers, lacked the required skills and knowledge and were discouraged by senior regulators from pursuing complex cases. \n FSCO told Reuters it could not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation. \u201cIn cases where FSCO believes there may be evidence of non-compliance with legislation and regulations, FSCO conducts a thorough investigation,\u201d the agency said. \u201cFSCO requires a high standard of proof and evidence to take enforcement action.\u201d \n Fortress spokeswoman Jenni Byrne said in a written statement: \u201cFortress will continue to vigorously defend themselves against false untrue claims.\u201d \n IMPATIENCE WITHIN \n Documents seen by Reuters show that in 2013, FSCO staff opened an investigation after the federal tax collector, the Canada Revenue Agency, sent information it said suggested that Fortress syndicated mortgages were, in effect, a Ponzi scheme. Less than a month later, FSCO investigators closed the file for \u201clack of valid or reliable information to support further investigation.\u201d \n A year later, after repeated requests to reopen an investigation into an investor\u2019s complaint about allegedly undisclosed fees on Fortress investments, a frustrated FSCO compliance staffer wrote in an email: \u201cDenied for the reason we don\u2019t need more work???\u201d \n In the Olympia episode, Monid\u2019s decision not to proceed was all the more surprising because FSCO had long known that the Calgary, Alberta, trust company was active in Ontario without a license: The agency\u2019s own lawyers had rejected Olympia\u2019s requests, in 2011 and 2013, that it be exempted from meeting the eligibility requirements for doing business in the province, according to the documents. \n \n \n Syndicated mortgages, which pool investors\u2019 money to finance construction of condominiums, retirement communities and the like, aren\u2019t suited to most retail investors. The instruments typically fund more speculative projects that can\u2019t rely solely on bank lending, making them relatively high-risk even in the best of times, suited to deep-pocketed professional investors. The risks have only grown as Canada\u2019s real estate market has shown signs of slowing, potentially amplifying investor losses if more projects fail. \n FSCO \u201ccould have removed this problem earlier,\u201d said Bill Vasiliou, a certified fraud examiner who was responsible for regulating Ontario's mortgage industry prior to FSCO's creation in 1997. \u201cThere were complaints registered, and they buried them. They didn't do anything about it.\u201d \n The regulator\u2019s inaction has prompted other government agencies to step in. Ontario's Finance Ministry said in April it planned to transfer responsibility for regulating syndicated mortgages from FSCO to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). That change, however, could take as long as two years, according to two sources with knowledge of the process. \n Documents seen by Reuters also show that Canada\u2019s federal police launched an investigation into Fortress\u2019s syndicated mortgage business in October 2016. Six people told Reuters they had been interviewed as part of the inquiry, led by the Integrated Market Enforcement Team of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). A police spokeswoman said the agency does not confirm an investigation is under way unless charges have been laid in court. \n Fortress spokeswoman Byrne said Fortress and its employees, including co-founders Jawad Rathore and Vince Petrozza, had not received any inquiries from the RCMP, and that \u201cto the best of their knowledge, they are not under investigation.\" \n IN THE DARK \n Rathore and Petrozza, longtime figures in Toronto financial circles, founded Fortress Real Developments in 2002. They began offering syndicated mortgage products to individual investors in 2008, a time when savers were hungry for alternatives to historically low interest rates. Both men declined to be interviewed for this article. \n For the typical Fortress product, a retail investor puts up a principal loan amount of between $30,000 and $100,000 for two to five years. During that time, the investor is paid regular interest \u2014 usually around eight per cent \u2014 and at the end of the term, the principal should be returned. \n A recurring investor complaint in the FSCO documents Reuters reviewed was that the products weren\u2019t what they had been billed to be. Investors said they hadn\u2019t been warned of the risks, that they hadn\u2019t been told they could lose their principal if a project failed, that they hadn\u2019t been told the often-advertised eight per cent returns weren\u2019t guaranteed, and that they hadn\u2019t been told Fortress and the brokers shared a 35 per cent cut. \n \n \n The complaints mostly targeted brokers who sold the investments. FSCO investigations into the complaints were routinely closed with no action taken. \n A 2014 complaint, for example, asserted that a broker selling Fortress products was associated with Fortress \u2014 a conflict of interest under Ontario rules, which require that a brokerage firm tell investors of any relationship it has with the originator of products it sells. \n The investigation was closed with no action taken. An unidentified FSCO staffer subsequently reviewing the case noted: \u201cNo one looked at the disclosure documents or saw the investment itself. The unlicensed activity was noted and documented in evidence uploaded to file but no one dealt with it.\u201d \n Fortress bills itself as a real estate development company that partners with builders and other developers, providing advice and financing. It insists that it is not involved in the marketing or sale of the syndicated mortgages that help fund its projects. \n That\u2019s the job of mortgage brokers, who are \u201csolely responsible for any marketing materials\u201d for syndicated mortgages, Byrne said. \n Fortress co-founder Rathore contradicted that position in an affidavit to the Registrar of Trade-Marks in July 2013: \u201cFortress Real Developments' real estate development work includes assisting in the preparation of marketing material and other documentation \u2026 which is then used by licensed mortgage agents and brokers in the selling of the syndicated mortgage products.\u201d \n The one instance when FSCO did take action directly against Fortress was in March 2015. The agency issued a letter of caution to the company after discovering that it was promoting syndicated mortgages despite not being licensed as a mortgage broker, according to emails seen by Reuters and three sources with knowledge of FSCO's investigations. Fortress acknowledged the unlicensed activity and altered its website to bring it into compliance. \n Even so, the line between Fortress and the brokerage firms selling Fortress investments remains blurred. \n Four of the six Fortress executives named on the company's website are registered as mortgage brokers or agents. Petrozza and two Fortress directors are licensed mortgage brokers with Building & Development Mortgages Canada (BDMC), the self-described \u201clead broker\u201d for Fortress projects. BDMC and Fortress have the same office address in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Byrne, the Fortress spokeswoman, also represents BDMC. \n Three other mortgage brokers - FDS Broker Services Inc, FFM Capital Inc and FMP Mortgage Investments Inc - market Fortress products directly or through other brokers as their primary or sole line of business. \n In 2011, Rathore and Petrozza settled accusations with the OSC that they had engaged \u201cin conduct contrary to the public interest\u201d by selling shares to clients of their debt-management business. They agreed to pay $3 million and were banned from selling securities for 15 years. \n Syndicated mortgages aren\u2019t securities, which is why they are overseen, along with other non-securitized financial products, by FSCO, rather than the OSC. \n The 2011 run-in with the OSC was why FSCO in 2013 investigated Petrozza\u2019s application to renew his mortgage broker\u2019s license, according to the three sources. His license was ultimately renewed on the condition that he undertake a period of supervision by another broker. \n Rathore withdrew license applications in January 2012 and again in April 2015 after FSCO staff raised concerns about the earlier regulatory action, the documents show. He \u201cultimately decided to continue to focus on real estate development and real estate development consulting,\u201d Byrne said. \n \u201cNEVER ANY ISSUES\u201d \n A big draw for investors in syndicated mortgages is that the investments can be put in Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), tax-preferred accounts similar to Individual Retirement Accounts in the United States. \n That\u2019s why Barry Stevens, a 70-year-old retiree in Canada\u2019s capital, Ottawa, invested a total of $150,000 in a Fortress condominium development in Barrie, Ontario, beginning in 2012. \n \n \n He said a broker told him that syndicated mortgages \u201cgave eight per cent interest, every one of these is a success, there are never any issues, and you always get your principal back.\u201d The clincher, he said, was that the investment could be put in his RRSP. \n He received regular interest payments, but when the loan matured in October 2016, he got back none of his principal. Fortress representatives assured him the money would arrive in mid-November, he said. It didn\u2019t. Fortress later told him the developer had walked away from the project. \n Stevens now works 12 hours a day as a security guard and hits the road at night as an Uber driver. \n Under Ontario law, RRSPs must be administered by a trust company licensed in the province. For reasons that aren\u2019t clear, Calgary-based Olympia became the provider of so-called Registered Plan Administrative Services (RPAS) for Fortress syndicated mortgage investments like Stevens\u2019s. \n \u201cFortress came to us,\u201d said Olympia President Craig Skauge. \"They said \u2018Here's what we do. Will you guys handle our clients?\u2019 We said, \u2018Sure.\u2019 \u201d \n Skauge confirmed that Olympia was twice denied permission to provide services to Ontario investors without a license. He said Olympia was able to continue to accept customers in Ontario as long as brokers there weren't promoting the trust firm. \u201cIf mortgage brokers in Ontario were in fact promoting Olympia Trust, then FSCO should have done something about that,\u201d he said. \n Documents related to FSCO\u2019s 2014 investigation into Olympia\u2019s role in Fortress investments show the agency in fact knew Olympia\u2019s services were being promoted to retail investors. \n Referring to an unidentified brokerage, the file reviewed by Reuters states: \u201cAgents at the brokerage assist with all documentation including filling out application forms for Olympia.\u201d It further states: \u201cOlympia Trust is the sole RPAS service provider\u201d for Fortress syndicated mortgage investments. \n Fortress said investors are responsible for choosing an administrator for the retirement savings accounts. \u201cFortress does not use or appoint trust firms for syndicated mortgage loans,\u201d Byrne said. \n A BIG CUT \n Brokerage firm BDMC\u2019s marketing materials for Fortress investments note that syndicated mortgage loans are \u201cnot without risks.\u201d In 2016, it added that the loans \u201clack early liquidity or redemption options\u201d and \u201ccarry the additional risks of construction loans and real estate development.\u201d \n It and other brokerage firms\u2019 promotions do not necessarily tell investors that Fortress and brokers take a big chunk of the money raised, or that investors are typically last in line, behind banks and other institutions, to get their money back if a project goes belly-up. \n Investors complained to FSCO that Fortress took 35 per cent of the funds raised, according to documents seen by Reuters. Of that, about half typically goes to brokers as commissions and fees. Industry sources said that generally, brokers take between 2 and 4 per cent for arranging a private mortgage. \n \n \n \u201cI thought the money contributed to the building or the costs of the construction,\u201d said 31-year-old chocolatier Xiaoyi Han, who in May 2015 put $100,000 in a Fortress syndicated mortgage to fund a waterfront condo development in Keswick, Ontario. \n Han, who was trying to save enough money to open a shop of her own, said she received interest payments of $2,000 for three quarters. Then the payments stopped, she said, and her principal was not returned when the mortgage matured. According to the Fortress website, construction crews are now working on the building\u2019s foundations. \n Han said federal police interviewed her as part of their investigation. She said she complained to FSCO about the investment on June 27. The regulator acknowledged the complaint and said it would investigate. She has not heard back. \n FSCO declined to comment on Han's case. \n Two complaints sent to FSCO in 2014 focused on the high fees. In both cases, the files were closed within three weeks without any action taken. \n FORMER POLICE \n At FSCO headquarters in the North York section of Toronto, a team of about 10 compliance officers review complaints about financial firms operating in Ontario. If they decide a complaint warrants further action, they \u201copen a file\u201d and pass it to FSCO's seven-man investigations unit, headed by Director of Investigations Terry Weller. \n Weller was an officer for 18 years with the Toronto Police Service, where he was assigned to several investigative offices, before he moved into financial regulation in 1990. His team is made up of former police with little prior experience in the financial services industry, according to two former and one current FSCO employee. \n Weller reports to Monid, the licensing and market conduct chief. He spent 15 years in Canada\u2019s armed forces and three years as an insurance company regulator before joining FSCO in 2005. He took up his current role in 2014. \n Staff were encouraged not to question Monid\u2019s decisions, two former FSCO staffers told Reuters. \u201cWe would write many reports that we believe were not acted upon,\u201d one of the former employees said. \n Vasiliou, the former Ontario regulator, said FSCO lacks the necessary skills and experience in-house to effectively supervise complex financial products like syndicated mortgages. \u201cThey should have hired people who could deal with the industry, and who understand the industry and have been thoroughly versed in the legislation,\u201d he said. \n In an email to Reuters, FSCO rejected that assertion: \u201cFSCO staff have the requisite knowledge, skills, experience, training, and support to regulate the syndicated mortgage market.\u201d \n Complaints from other government agencies fared no better with FSCO than those from investors. \n In July 2013, FSCO opened a file after the Canada Revenue Agency \u201chad advised (FSCO legal counsel Joe) Nemet they suspected Fortress to be Ponzi in nature,\u201d an internal FSCO email states. \n The file was closed less than a month later. Investigators wrote: \u201cIn conclusion there is no valid or reliable information to support further investigation of the (Ponzi) allegations. It is recommended no further action be initiated.\u201d Monid concurred, the documents show. \n The Canada Revenue Agency declined to comment. \n \"GREED WRITTEN ALL OVER IT\" \n By 2015, investor complaints and official concern about syndicated mortgages were growing. \n In May that year, FSCO Chief Executive Brian Mills called a meeting of senior staff, including Monid and Weller, after Ontario Finance Minister Charles Souza requested information on the products, according to the three people familiar with FSCO investigations. Mills reacted to the presentation by FSCO staffers with shock, saying, \u201cThis has got greed written all over it,\u201d according to a person who attended the meeting. \n Investigations chief Weller, the person said, responded that there was \u201ca lot of smoke, but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any fire.\u201d \n FSCO spokeswoman Jenna LeBlanc said Mills had no memory of what was said at the meeting. \n In a briefing note for the meeting, reviewed by Reuters, FSCO staff presented a long list of recommendations to beef up oversight and investigations of the syndicated mortgage business. Among them: that FSCO send a cease-and-desist order to Olympia Trust to stop it from accepting new accounts for syndicated mortgage investments from Ontario residents. That\u2019s when Monid decided there was not enough evidence to proceed, internal FSCO emails show. \n Around the same time, Steve Dowling, the top securities regulator for Prince Edward Island, contacted a FSCO compliance officer to ask about the products. Residents of his small province who had bought in, he said, were worried that they had lost their money. \n In a subsequent memo to Dowling, the compliance officer wrote that syndicated mortgages were being \u201cfunded by everyday consumers \u2013 mom and pop investors. The marketing is heavy hitting and very glossy. \u2026 The hook is that they are registered under a self-directed RRSP.\u201d \n In an October 2015 email seen by Reuters, a FSCO compliance officer noted that \u201c17 files of significance\u201d had been opened relating to Fortress, Rathore and Petrozza since March 2011, and that all had been closed without direct action taken against Fortress. \n The same email notes that a \u201cproportion of the syndicated mortgage investment is set aside to pay investors\u2019 interest\u201d making the investments \u201cPonzi like in nature.\u201d \n In an August 2016 posting on its website, FSCO warned consumers to be wary of syndicated mortgage investments \u201cwith advertisements promoting a high return or \u2018fully secured\u2019 investment.\u201d \n FSCO in October last year suspended the operations of three smaller companies selling syndicated mortgage investments, citing two of them for \u201csystemic disregard\u201d of basic consumer protection issues. Specific reasons cited included failure to provide written disclosure of material risk, failure to disclose conflicts of interest, failure to ensure the suitability of the investments for investors, and providing false and misleading information. \n After announcing in April that regulation of syndicated mortgage investments would be shifted from FSCO to the OSC, Ontario's Ministry of Finance in August moved to limit investors\u2019 exposure to the products, recommending an annual cap of $25,000. Regulatory sources said any changes are at least six months away. \n And in July, after Reuters began making inquiries about Fortress syndicated mortgages, FSCO sent an email reminder to agents and brokers: \u201cYou cannot promote the services of a loan and trust company unless they are registered in Ontario,\u201d it said. \n In an Aug. 24 email to Reuters, FSCO said the reminder \u201cwas a result of a voluntary cessation of syndicated mortgage business by a trust company not licensed in Ontario after consultation with FSCO.\u201d \n FSCO subsequently confirmed to Reuters that the company was Olympia Trust, which had agreed that from Aug. 4, 2017, it would cease accepting new registered accounts for syndicated mortgage investments from Ontario residents. \n Skauge, the Olympia Trust president, said the company agreed to the decision after FSCO raised questions with it about the \u201cindustry's practices in Ontario.\" \n \"This market grew faster than FSCO was able to handle,\" he said. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "CMHC says 47% decrease in mortgage loan insurance business is the 'new normal'", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cmhc-says-47-decrease-in-mortgage-loan-insurance-business-is-the-new-normal-1.929653", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Nov 29, 2017", "content": "Canada's national housing agency says the 47 per cent decline in the country's insured mortgage market year-over-year in the third quarter is the \"new normal level.\" \n The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says in its latest financial report that it provided mortgage loan insurance to 67,915 units for the three-month period ended Sept. 30 compared to 127,991 units during the same period a year ago. \n Steve Mennill, CMHC's senior vice-president of insurance, says decreased volumes have been steady throughout the year as a result of the new regulations announced by the federal government in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n The mortgage rules require all home buyers with less than a 20 per cent down payment to undergo a stress test to ensure the borrower can still service their loan should interest rates rise, or their personal finances fall.

Federally regulated financial institutions must also establish and adhere to loan-to-value ratio limits that are updated as housing markets and economic dynamics evolve. \n The broad thrust of the final guidelines are similar to what OSFI had proposed in July, when the regulator put out a draft for public consultation. The proposed changes were criticized for potentially increasing costs and limiting access to mortgages for some buyers. \n The Fraser Institute, an independent, non-partisan think tank which tends to prefer free-market policies, said last week that a stress test for uninsured mortgages was unnecessary and could do more harm than good. \n \n \n Rudin reiterated Tuesday that OSFI was aware the stricter guidelines could have unintended consequences, such as sending borrowers towards more risky lenders that are out of the regulator's purview. \n \"We can't control what we can't control,\" he said. \"Our mandate is focused on the safety and soundness of the federally regulated institutions...

In the published guidelines, OSFI said would-be homebuyers will need to prove they can still service their uninsured mortgage at a qualifying rate of the greater of the contractual mortgage rate plus two percentage points or the five-year benchmark rate published by the Bank of Canada. \n Rudin said the tweak was to address concerns and feedback that using the contract rate plus two percentage points would incentivize borrowers to find the lowest possible rate, which could be shortest possible term. \n \"We didn't want to create an artificial incentive for borrowers to shorten terms because of the regulation,\" he said. \n \u00a0 \n \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": "Joanna Smith", "title": "Mortgage rules discriminate against new Canadians, entrepreneurs: CMHC", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mortgage-rules-discriminate-against-new-canadians-entrepreneurs-cmhc-1.872912", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Oct 2, 2017", "content": "OTTAWA -- The national housing agency is exploring ways to make it easier for entrepreneurs and new immigrants to buy a home by cutting some of the red tape required to prove they can afford to pay the mortgage. \n \"Right now, under our mortgage insurance policies, you have to be able to document income to get mortgage insurance, to a level of specificity that discriminates against new Canadians, because they can't do that,\" Evan Siddall, the CEO of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., said in a wide-ranging interview with The Canadian Press. \n \"It discriminates against entrepreneurs, as well, because they can't prove their income as well, so we're looking at our own policies to try and make sure that there is more equity in our mortgage insurance programs,\" he said. \n Anyone who wants to buy a home in Canada without a down payment of at least 20 per cent of the purchase price is usually required to get mortgage loan insurance from the CMHC, which requires a smaller down payment of five per cent on a home worth up to $500,000. \n A 10-per-cent down payment is required for the portion of the price over $500,000, with $1 million being the maximum property value allowed. \n The mortgage insurance comes with a premium, which the lender will then pass on to the person buying the home. \n Borrowers need to satisfy lenders they will be able to make their mortgage payments, which usually means providing proof of employment and a few pay stubs. \n But that can be tricky for people who just started their own business. \n It can also be a barrier to those whose employment history has gaps for other reasons, such as having recently immigrated to Canada. \n People who are self-employed, for example, usually need to provide notices of assessment for the previous two years. Their income is determined by averaging those two years, although the most recent year can be used if it has increased annually for at least four years. \n They also need to have been doing the same type of work for at least two years. \n Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said more flexibility would be welcome, especially for startups. \n \"If one starts a business or is self-employed, the lines between their personal and business finances are often quite blurry,\" Kelly said. \n \"Often, their personal assets are required to get financing for the business. But then they also have a challenge getting financing on the personal side, because they don't have the nice, clean letter of offer from an employer that is often quite convincing in these situations,\" he said. \n Any relaxation of the rules would naturally increase the risk. So Siddall said the agency is looking at how to manage that, including different ways to document income, and higher premiums. \n \"Can we charge for that risk? Better to charge that risk than not to make it available,\" he said. \n Jack Fiorillo, a broker with TMG The Mortgage Group in Woodbridge, Ont., said he expects the CMHC to be fairly conservative on this front. \n \"It will be a very small sandbox that CMHC will play in, probably at the beginning, and then maybe if once their risk appetite increases, maybe they can expand that box,\" said Fiorillo. \n He said he expects the potential change to make it easier for a relatively small number of self-employed people to get a mortgage, and they will likely have to pay higher interest rates. \n The CMHC said it has been compiling data on how many would-be homeowners have their mortgage applications rejected for these reasons, but cannot disclose those numbers right now because it is based on conversations with commercial lenders. \n \"We are still doing research and development to move this forward,\" CMHC spokesman Jonathan Rotondo said in an email. \n Siddall said the Crown corporation has raised the idea with its board and expects to announce something within the next six months. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "CMHC: Insured mortgage market falls 33% after new regulations", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cmhc-insured-mortgage-market-falls-33-after-new-regulations-1.842296", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Aug 29, 2017", "content": "OTTAWA -- Canada's national housing agency says new regulations introduced last fall decreased the size of the country's insured mortgage market by about 33 per cent year-over-year in the second quarter. \n The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. says in its latest financial report that it provided mortgage loan insurance to 78,607 units in the three-month period ended June 30 compared to 117,463 units during the same period a year ago. \n CMHC says volumes decreased largely as a result of the new regulations announced by the federal government in the fourth quarter of 2016. \n The mortgage rules require all home buyers with less than a 20 per cent down payment to undergo a stress test to ensure the borrower can still service their loan should interest rates rise, or their personal finances fall.

In a securities filing, the bank said it was working with regulators to see if customers had been harmed by the fees. \n \n \n Interest rate locks are guarantees by a lender to lock in a set interest rate, usually for several weeks, while a loan is processed. If the rate lock expires before a loan closes, lenders often cover the cost of extending the lock if the delay was their fault. \n Wells Fargo usually locked in rates for 30 to 90 days but often took longer than that to process applications because of understaffing, the lawsuit said. The bank routinely blamed borrowers for delays and charged them to extend rate locks, according to the lawsuit. \n Fees could be significant, amounting to 0.125 per cent to 0.25 per cent of the loan amount, the complaint said. \n The named plaintiff, Nevada resident Victor Muniz, said he was charged US$287.50 for a rate lock extension this year after his application for a mortgage was bogged down by bank delays. \n Muniz was told by a bank employee that Wells Fargo would pay to extend the rate lock but a regional manager reversed that decision, the lawsuit said. \n The case is Muniz v Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. District Court, California Northern District, No 17-cv-4995.\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": "Andy Blatchford", "title": "Rising household debt could slow long-term growth: Study", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/economics/article/rising-household-debt-could-slow-long-term-growth-study-1.838846", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Aug 25, 2017", "content": "OTTAWA  \u2014 \u00a0Even debt-free Canadians could eventually feel a pinch from someone else's maxed-out credit cards, suggests research presented to senior officials at the federal housing agency. \n Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. board members received an update in March on the country's credit and housing trends. \n The presentation contained a warning: the steady climb of the household debt-to-GDP level had put Canada's long-term economic growth prospects at risk. \n The document pointed to a study that argued household debt accumulation eventually hampers economic growth over the longer term, eclipsing the nearer-term benefits of consumption. \n The strong expansion of household spending, encouraged by a prolonged period of historically low borrowing rates, has created concerns over Canadians' record-high debt loads. \n It has also been a major driver of economic growth. \n The Canadian Press obtained a copy of the CMHC presentation via the Access to Information Act. It was included in a \"confidential\" memo to deputy finance minister Paul Rochon. \n Citing international research, the CMHC presentation points to an estimate that says a one percentage point increase in household debt-to-GDP tends to lower growth in a country's real gross domestic product by 0.1 percentage points at least three years later. \n The calculation, published in a January study by the Bank for International Settlements, was based on an average produced from the data of 54 countries from 1990 to 2015. \n \"Our results suggest that debt boosts consumption and GDP growth in the short run, with the bulk of the impact of increased indebtedness passing through the real economy in the space of one year,\" said the BIS report. \n \"However, the long-run negative effects of debt eventually outweigh their short-term positive effects, with household debt accumulation ultimately proving to be a drag on growth.\" \n An accompanying chart in the CMHC presentation showed that between 2010 and 2016 Canada's household debt-to-GDP level rose by more than five percentage points. The household debt-to-GDP ratio increased from almost 93 per cent to just over 101 per cent at the end of 2016, Statistics Canada says. \n A reduction of even 0.1 percentage points in the country's GDP can have an impact. For example, Canada saw year-over-year growth in real GDP last year of 1.3 per cent. \n The chart listed eight developed countries and ranked Canada second, behind Australia, for having the biggest increase in household debt-to-GDP level over the six-year period. \n BMO chief economist Doug Porter says he doesn't dispute the broader conclusion that a rising household debt-to-GDP level poses risks for growth. \n But he's skeptical one can draw a direct line from the household debt-to-GDP directly to economic growth down the road. For one, he said interest rate levels must be factored in. \n \"I'd be very cautious about putting pinpoint accuracy on that,\" Porter said. \"I think that's incredibly difficult to do.\" \n However, Porter says the record levels of household debt piling up in Canada, like in many industrial-world economies, does suggest it will be tougher for the country to grow as quickly as it has in the past. \n \"The consumer spending and housing gains that we could reap from lower interest rates have basically been reaped,\" he said. \n \"And, if anything, interest rates are probably more likely to rise than fall from current levels.

The term prime rate refers to the interest rate that banks charge their preferred customers, or those with the highest credit ratings. It is used to determine borrowing costs on many short-term loan products. \n Banks use the prime rate to set interest rates on numerous short-term loan products. These include variable-rate mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and home equity loans. \n The terms of such loans typically are expressed as prime plus or minus a certain percentage, depending on the borrower\u2019s credit rating and other factors. For example, someone considered a good credit risk may qualify for \u201cprime plus one per cent.\u201d or maybe even just \u201cprime\u201d. \n So what does this mean to the rest of us who may not be a preferred customer: \n \n If you are a borrower with a variable rate tied to prime, your costs are going higher and more of your payment will go towards paying off interest versus principle. \n If you have a fixed term rate mortgage you have some breathing room until you are up for renewal. \n If you have a variable-rate mortgage that is based on your lenders prime rate, this is where the impact on your payments happen. You could be plus- or minus-prime based on\u00a0 the discount you negotiated. Payments on most variable-rate mortgages will be adjusted higher to reflect the increase in the bank\u2019s prime lending rate. \n \n Not all variable-rate mortgages payments will be adjusted and here\u2019s why: As rates go higher, more of your payment goes toward paying interest and less goes toward principle resulting in a longer period of time to pay it off. \n We often use the term \u201cvariable-rate mortgage\u201d to describe and lump all mortgages together where rates can fluctuate during the term of the loan. However, \u201cadjustable-rate mortgages\u201d are where the payments are reset when your lenders prime rate changes. \n Bottom line: With a variable-rate mortgage your mix of principle and interest changes not the amount of the payment. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": null, "title": "Canada's banks increase prime lending rates", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-banks-increase-prime-lending-rates-1.803123", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jul 13, 2017", "content": "Canada\u2019s big banks increased their prime lending rates on Wednesday. \n Hours after the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to increase its key interest rate 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent, Royal Bank ( RY.TO ), TD Bank ( TD.TO ), Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ), CIBC ( CM.TO ), Bank of Montreal ( BMO.TO ), National Bank ( NA.TO ), Laurentian Bank, and HSBC Bank Canada\u00a0all boosted their\u00a0rates. \n RBC was first to move, raising its prime rate 25 basis points higher to 2.95 per cent, effective July 13. \n The rest followed suit with identical moves later in the afternoon. \n Banks use the prime rate to help determine interest rates on various loans, including variable-rate mortgages.\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": null, "title": "What a rate hike could mean for Canada\u2019s hot housing markets", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/what-a-rate-hike-could-mean-for-canada-s-hot-housing-markets-1.801059", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jul 10, 2017", "content": "With all eyes turned toward the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate decision on Wednesday, some of Canada\u2019s top housing minds analyzed what a potential rise in rates might mean for the nation\u2019s hot housing markets.

In addition, we feel that Canadian homeowners are prepared for the marginal increase in mortgage rates that an interest rate hike may bring. In fact, within the last two years, the proportion that households spent on mortgage principal payments exceeded that spent on mortgage interest payments for the first time since Statistics Canada began compiling its data in 1990.\u201d \n Conflicting fears \n John Pasalis, president, Realosophy Realty Inc. \n \u201cToronto\u2019s real estate market is feeling the after effects of a housing bubble that peaked during the first quarter of this year. \n In theory, the Bank of Canada raising interest rates by 25 basis points would have a dampening effect on the demand for homes \u2013 but I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019re going to see any immediate effects.\u00a0If we look south of the border, the U.S. has seen three rate increases totaling 75 basis points since December 2016 and demand for homes still appears to be strong with the Case-Shiller 20-City Index up 5.7 per cent year over year in April.\u00a0 \n The psychological effects of this rate increase might counterintuitively have a positive effect on the real estate market.\u00a0If buyers believe interest rates will increase even further in the near future, some of those sitting on the sidelines watching the cooling market with uncertainty may get back into the hunt. \n The big unknown is whether the fear of future interest rate hikes will outweigh fears about buying into a market that has seen prices trending down over the past three months. No one wants to buy now if they think prices will fall further.\u201d \n \n \n \n BANK OF CANADA: WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY? \n  'Major quibble' as the Bank of Canada gears up to raise rates \n  Boosting rates can curb the 'debt appetite' of Canadians: CIBC \n  'Misguided' for Bank of Canada to raise rates: Capital Economics  \n \n \n \n Spooking the flock \r\nRob McLister, Founder, RateSpy.com \n \u201cThe Bank\u00a0of Canada\u2019s messaging and market probabilities suggest that by this time next year rates should be at least 50 to 75 basis points higher. \n Vigorous job growth and GDP support a rate hike, as do household risks, albeit this last factor is not core to the Bank of Canada\u2019s mandate. \n Anemic wage growth, non-energy exports and lackluster inflation argue against hikes, but the latter is a lagging indicator and Governor Stephen Poloz suggests that inflation is bottoming. \n The fact is, the Bank must act while it is partially blind. If it waits until it\u2019s obvious the economy is overheating, it may need to hike too much later, raising the risk of recession. \n Given the Bank\u2019s tip-offs, its desire to maintain credibility, Canada\u2019s economic buoyancy, housing risks and bond market probabilities, put your chips on a July 12 hike. If you\u2019re wrong, double down for September 6 or October 25. \n Quarter- or half-point higher rates are no threat to housing other than from a psychological perspective. Most borrowers could still get approved for a mortgage. \n One-point higher rates would noticeably drive up real estate listings and further slow sales, especially if OSFI\u2019s new stress test passes and takes more buyers out of the market. \n Two-point higher rates would weigh down home prices and trigger a noticeable but contained bump up in defaults. \n Three-point higher rates, while unlikely this decade, would lead to contagion selling and a further spike in mortgage arrears. \n One surefire result of a hike will be that it spooks a large flock of floating rate borrowers into locking in. Unfortunately, many don\u2019t realize that the bond market front-runs BoC policy actions, so they end up locking in too late.\u201d \n Kevin Somers,\u00a0John Pasalis, and\u00a0Rob McLister's comments were provided to BNN to preview this week's Bank of Canada interest rate decision.

But Finance Ministry data shows that the share of unregulated lenders had shot to 12.5 per cent of Canada's $1.6 trillion mortgage market in 2015, up from 6.6 per cent in 2007. \n Home Capital Group, which last month agreed to a $2 billion loan from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, and Equitable Group, are two listed mortgage providers that have told Reuters they participate in bundled lending. \n Equitable's Chief Executive Andrew Moor said in an interview on Thursday that 10 per cent of the company's new mortgage originations involved co-lending arrangements, which he said were used as a \"risk management tool.\" \n Moor said he did not expect all that business to be lost and expects homebuyers will find another way to make a downpayment. \n \"People may be forced to sell an asset they otherwise wouldn't choose to sell to come up with a bigger downpayment. It's hard to know what impact it will have on our business but it's not in double-digits,\" he said. \n Moor said he would consult with OSFI but was expecting the proposal will be implemented. \n \"A lot of these changes seem to be unfavorable for people that are self-employed or new to Canada who might otherwise have a challenge getting a mortgage. The other consequences of actions like this need to be understood,\" he added. \n Home Capital has not disclosed how much of its business depends upon it and did not respond to requests for comment. \n Shares of Equitable were down 0.4 per cent while Home Capital shares, which have lost nearly half their value since the start of the year, were down 3.9 per cent. Another alternative lender, Street Capital, was down 3.8 per cent. \n LATEST MEASURES BY GOVERNMENT \n Bundled or co-lending agreements with an unregulated entity can enable lenders to offer combined mortgages worth up to 90 per cent of a property's value. \n Under federal rules, regulated lenders in Canada are not allowed to lend more than 65 percent of the value of a home to borrowers with bad or nonexistent credit records. \n They also cannot lend more than 80 per cent of a property's value - even to borrowers with solid credit - without obtaining government-backed insurance. Under rules rolled out last October, that insurance requires the banks to run income stress tests on borrowers. \n Canadian authorities have said bundling represents a small portion of the mortgage market. However, mortgage brokers say the arrangements have proliferated as Canadian regulators tighten lending standards to shield borrowers in case a decade-long housing boom goes bust. \n The regulator also proposed rules on Thursday requiring a stress test for all uninsured mortgages and that the maximum amounts lent out against a property's value are adjusted for local market conditions. \n The proposals are the latest in a series of measures implemented by Canadian authorities over the past 12 months amid concerns about housing market bubbles. \n The Ontario government introduced measures in April to try to cool the housing market in Toronto, including a foreign buyers tax. Sales in Canada's largest city fell 37 per cent in June compared with a year ago, the Toronto Real Estate Board said on Thursday. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": "Michelle Zadikian, chase producer, BNN", "title": "Mortgage brokers begin to 'test the waters' with Home Capital", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mortgage-brokers-begin-to-test-the-waters-with-home-capital-1.787357", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jun 23, 2017", "content": "Home Capital is starting to see mortgage referrals come through the door again after being shunned by some brokers. \n Samantha Brookes, the CEO of Mortgages of Canada, told BNN in an interview she\u2019s begun to resume submitting business to Home Capital after having to send referrals elsewhere in the wake of OSC disclosure allegations that caused a run on deposits. \n \u201cLast week, we started to send in a few deals and they\u2019ve actually picked them up pretty quickly,\u201d she said. \n Brookes is not the only broker to resume sending clients to Home Capital. \n \u201cWe are testing the waters with them the last couple of weeks with a few deals,\u201d Dan Eisner, CEO of True North Mortgage told BNN in an email. \u201cThey have been a back-up lender on a couple of deals.\u201d \n Many mortgage brokers were forced to find alternatives after nervous depositors yanked funds from Home Capital accounts, leaving its Home Trust subsidiary with a massive liquidity crunch which raised questions about their ability to fund mortgages.\u00a0 \n \u201cWe were sending our deals elsewhere,\u201d Brookes said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have an option because they were taking quite a long time to process our files and obviously if you have a client who\u2019s closing on a purchase, you don\u2019t have that time to play with because it\u2019s a contractual agreement and there are penalties that go on the client.\u201d \n Home Capital has been trying to right the ship by shaking up its boardroom ranks and securing credit facilities.\u00a0 \n Brookes says she even got a surprise in-person visit from a Home Capital Business Development Manager who she hasn\u2019t seen in two years. \n \u201cHe just decided he was going to pop by,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to bring back that nurturing to the broker channel.\u201d \n Now that the beleaguered lender has the support of Berkshire Hathaway behind it, it\u2019s going a long way to soothe brokers\u2019 concerns about Home Capital\u2019s viability. \n \u201cI do believe a year from now, things will change and they\u2019ll be back funding mortgages as usual,\u201d Brookes said. \n While Eisner is concerned about the terms of Berkshire\u2019s credit terms, he agrees that it gives him confidence Home Trust will be around for the long term. \n Ron Butler, the president of Butler Mortgage, said a backer like Warren Buffett is likely the most critical piece in restoring not only Home Trust, but bringing back confidence to the alternative lending space in general. \n \u201cI have always said the key to recovery was the introduction of a massive financial player engaging with Home Trust on some level,\u201d he said. \n \u201c[One of the] richest men on the planet certainly fits that bill.\u201d \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Personal Investor: Is a house still a good investment?", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/personal-investor-is-a-house-still-a-good-investment-1.741483", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "May 3, 2017", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Dale Jackson\n                             \n Personal Finance Columnist, Payback Time   Follow | Archive \n \n \n For generations of Canadians it\u2019s been a given that buying your own home is one of the best investments you can make. For that reason, it\u2019s the biggest investment most Canadians ever make. \n That assumption is being challenged right now as real estate prices \u2013 especially in Vancouver and Toronto \u2013 skyrocket. \n Canada is a big country and real estate markets vary from region to region but there are ways to determine how your house stacks up to other investments. \u00a0\u00a0 \n How a house is like other investments \n Equity appreciation:  You often hear of huge year-over-year short-term price increases but according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) the average Canadian house has increased in value by just over five per cent each year over 30-year spans since the 1970s. Over 30-year periods house prices could rise and fall but in the long-term they tend to average out to a decent return. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Preferred financing:  The fact that houses at least retain their value allows banks to lend money to homebuyers at low rates. Since the loan is backed by the property, lenders really take little risk that the value of the property will drop below the down payment. Right now a five-year mortgage is available at a rate of 2.5 per cent. \u00a0 \n Capital gains tax exemption:  Assuming the house appreciates in value, the gains made when it is sold are never taxed as long as it is your principal residence. The tax implications are identical to a tax-free savings account (TFSA), where gains are never taxed. Half of equity gains outside a principal residence or registered account are taxed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Income potential:  Owning a home saves the occupants having to pay rent. Home owners also have the option of generating income by taking in renters. They can also draw income from the equity in their home through a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. \n How a house is NOT like other investments \n Borrowing to invest:  Most Canadians must borrow to invest in a home. Borrowing to invest always brings an added layer of risk. Even if the property appreciates in value, homeowners could lose their jobs and their ability to make regular payments. House prices can fluctuate over the short term and being forced to sell brings the risk of selling in a down market. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Not diversified:  Investment portfolio diversification lowers risk and exposes the investor to opportunity. A house is not diversified. It is in one geographic area and in one sector (real estate). \u00a0 \n Needs maintenance:  While house prices rarely depreciate in value, the physical house deteriorates and could depreciate in value if it is not maintained. You never need to put a new roof on a mutual fund or exchange traded fund. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n It\u2019s where you live:  Wise investors say never invest in anything you\u2019re not prepared to lose. If you lose a house, you lose your home. \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "New budget details $11.2B in affordable housing", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/new-budget-details-11-2b-in-affordable-housing-1.703508", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 22, 2017", "content": "OTTAWA - Today's federal budget is dedicating $11.2 billion to cities and provinces for affordable housing over the coming decade as part of the second wave of the government's infrastructure program. \n Of that money, which comes from the government's social infrastructure fund, $5 billion will be to encourage housing providers to pool their resources with private partners, and to allow the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to provide more direct loans to cities. \n The details are among many laid out in the budget, which details how the government plans to spend the $81 billion it is making available between now and 2028 to address Canada's future infrastructure needs. \n The Liberals clearly see a need to attract private investors to help pay for infrastructure projects, including affordable housing, given the federal government's tight fiscal position. \n A proposed new infrastructure bank would use public dollars to leverage private investment in three key areas: trade corridors, green infrastructure, and public transit. \n The government is setting aside $15 billion in cash for the bank, with spending set to start as early as the next fiscal year on projects based on budget projections. \n \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Pattie Lovett-Reid: How this millennial paid off his mortgage in 3 years", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pattie-lovett-reid-how-this-millennial-paid-off-his-mortgage-in-3-years-1.689806", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 7, 2017", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Pattie Lovett-Reid\n                             \n Chief Financial Commentator, CTV   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Most would love a home but I\u2019ve never heard anyone say they would love a mortgage. Sean Cooper, author of the new book \"Burn Your Mortgage,\"\u00a0made headlines around the world when he paid off his mortgage in three years at age 30. Sean has always been driven by a passion for financial freedom, but achieving success didn\u2019t just happen. It takes hard work and a lot of discipline, but he did it. \n I had a chance to chat with Sean, and while he highlights the importance of tracking expenses, and having a budget and sticking to it, he also focuses on a big misconception - the frequency of your monthly payment versus accelerating your mortgage payments. \n Here is what Sean had to say: \n \"There\u2019s a common misconception about payment frequency. Many people think that how often they make a mortgage payment plays a larger role in interest savings than it actually does (in fact, it plays a small role.) It\u2019s the accelerated alternatives that save you the big bucks. When you pay weekly (52 payments per year) or bi-weekly (26 payments per year) instead of monthly (12 payments per year), the interest savings are minimal; in these scenarios, it\u2019s more about finding the payment frequency that best matches your cash flow. With accelerated weekly (52 payments per year) and biweekly (26 payments per year), you\u2019re paying the equivalent of an extra month\u2019s payment every year (more on this below).\" \n \"At first glance, you\u2019re probably wondering how you\u2019re saving any interest with accelerated weekly or biweekly. After all, you\u2019re still making the same number of payments as non-accelerated weekly and biweekly. While that may be true, you\u2019re actually paying a slightly higher amount on each mortgage payment. To understand this, it helps to look at the difference in the way biweekly and accelerated biweekly are calculated.\" \n \"If your monthly mortgage payment is $1,418 and you pay biweekly, your biweekly payment is $654 ($1,418 \u00d7 12 months/26 weeks = $654). But when you pay accelerated biweekly, your biweekly payment is slightly higher, at $709 ($1,418 \u00d7 12 months/24 weeks = $709). As mentioned, with accelerated weekly and biweekly, you\u2019re paying the equivalent of 13 monthly mortgage payments instead of only 12.\"\u00a0 \n \"Paying accelerated on a biweekly schedule that matches your payday is the most painless way to budget for the higher payment. You won\u2019t even realize you\u2019re making higher annual payments (it\u2019s probably a good thing, as you might not choose this option if you did).\" \n Here are three of his best mortgage-burning strategies: \n 1. Know the terms of your mortgage.  There\u2019s more to a mortgage than just the mortgage rate. Know when you can take advantage of prepayment privileges. \n 2. Make lump-sum payments.  Apply \u201cfound\u201d money like bonuses, cash gifts, pay raises and tax refunds to your mortgage. \n 3. Shop around for your mortgage.  Don\u2019t automatically sign your mortgage renewal papers without shopping around. Start looking four to six months ahead of when your mortgage term ends. \n"}, {"source": "Reuters", "author": "Matt Scuffham", "title": "Canada's financial watchdog warns lenders against bundled mortgage loans", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-s-financial-watchdog-warns-lenders-against-bundled-mortgage-loans-1.679621", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 23, 2017", "content": "Canada's financial watchdog has warned regulated mortgage providers against teaming up with unregulated rivals to sidestep rules designed to clamp down on risky lending, a top regulator told Reuters. \n Carolyn Rogers, assistant superintendent at the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, said in an interview that the regulator was taking action to stamp out so-called \"bundled\" loans, which pair a primary mortgage with a second loan from unregulated groups called Mortgage Investment Corporations (MICs). \n Reuters reported last month that the practice can circumvent rules limiting how much mortgage providers can lend against a property, and the arrangements have proliferated as Canadian regulators have tightened lending standards to shield borrowers in case a decade-long housing boom goes bust. \n \"They are rules.
