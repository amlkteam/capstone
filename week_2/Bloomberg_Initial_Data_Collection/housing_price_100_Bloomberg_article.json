However, RBC said with\u00a0continued\u00a0low rates, a bounce in immigration, and strength returning to the job market,\u00a0the pent-up demand could help sales surge 40 per cent in 2021.\u00a0 \n Meanwhile,\u00a0Hamed Amiran, a sales representative at Royal LePage Signature Realty,\u200b told me in an email that first-time home buyers are still active, but having difficulties finding enough inventory to choose from. \n The digital buying and selling of real estate could be the new norm and for those who are technologically-savvy, the\u00a0pick-up in market activity could happen sooner than we think.\u200b \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Noah Zivitz", "title": "COVID-19 stings Toronto housing as sales sink 69% in early April", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/covid-19-stings-toronto-housing-as-sales-sink-69-in-early-april-1.1424910", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Apr 22, 2020", "content": "Canada's largest housing market went into a deep freeze in the first half of this month as COVID-19 decimated homebuyer demand. \n Home sales across the Greater Toronto Area fell 69 per cent year-over-year during the first 17 days of April as just 1,654 homes traded hands, according to data released Wednesday morning by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB). \n New listings nearly matched that decline, slumping 63.7 per cent from the same time last year. \n Prices were relatively steady compared to the same period last year, according to TRREB, as the average slipped 1.5 per cent to $819,665.

On the inside, it\u2019s a barren landscape. All 37 floors are empty. \n Office landlords in major cities around the world are facing a hit from the coronavirus. In Canada\u2019s energy capital, they\u2019re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree. \n More than 20 per cent\u00a0of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent\u00a0of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and \u201ca huge crater\u201d in local government finances. \n It\u2019s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada\u2019s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade\u2019s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market\u2019s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet. \n Now there\u2019s an epic glut. Net asking rents -- what the landlord receives -- for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15\u00a0per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America\u2019s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus. \n Boom, bust, bust \n Four buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China\u2019s Cnooc Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market. \n \u201cThe office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,\u201d said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young. \n Canada\u2019s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oil sands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production. \n The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers\u2019 ability to grow. \n \u201cThere was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,\u201d said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Canada. \u201cWhereas now, it\u2019s been bust for a long time.\u201d His firm sees the city\u2019s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent\u00a0by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas. \n \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they\u2019re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,\u201d Van Dijk said. \n The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn\u2019t survive or deserted their leased space. \n Unemployment rising \n The crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes. \n Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent\u00a0last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the specter of 25 per cent\u00a0unemployment for the province. \n Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil\u2019s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oil sands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary\u2019s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space. \n Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said. \n Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that\u2019s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said. \n For CoStar\u2019s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said. \n \u201cThe question is, \u2018Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?\u2019\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.\u201d \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: COVID-19 puts Canadian housing at risk; Indigo CEO's retail warning", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-covid-19-puts-canadian-housing-at-risk-indigo-ceo-s-retail-warning-1.1422299", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Apr 16, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n We all know the real estate industry morphed into a pillar of Canada\u2019s economy in recent years.

We\u2019ll chase commentary. \n RETAIL WARNING \n One of Canada\u2019s best-known retail executives has made it clear that relaunching the economy is going to be a slow and painful process for her industry. Indigo Books & Music founder and CEO Heather Reisman told BNN Bloomberg late yesterday afternoon that the general consensus among a peer group she\u2019s leading is that it will be \u201cpost-Christmas before business comes anywhere near back to normal\u201d and that \u201chundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d are likely to be lost as the industry is \u201cbrought to our knees\u201d by the pandemic. So that\u2019s a starting point for discussions today about additional support that will be needed (Reisman pointed to rent as a top concern), and what needs to be happening behind the scenes right now to prepare for whenever social distancing and other containment efforts begin to be relaxed. \n OUTBREAK AT KEARL \n Imperial Oil\u2019s Kearl oil sands project is dealing with an outbreak of COVID-19, according to Alberta\u2019s chief medical health officer. Deena Hinshaw said her in daily briefing late yesterday that three people connected to Kearl\u2019s work camp are positive, and another six are in isolation pending the result of their tests. Premier Jason Kenney, whose government declared the operation of oil sands an essential service, dismissed the idea of shutting down work camps as sounding \u201ca lot easier than it actually is\u201d with billions of dollars in economically-crucial assets at stake. \n OIL WATCH \n West Texas Intermediate was holding north of US$20/barrel in early trading today after four straight losing sessions that saw the American crude benchmark slide almost 20 per cent. Our Bloomberg News partners are reporting the White House is \u201cconsidering paying U.S. oil producers to leave crude in the ground\u201d to help stabilize the market.

As its oil sector shriveled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis.

BNN Bloomberg's Greg Bonnell has the details.   \n \n If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack -- certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer.Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiraled higher, homeowners felt richer -- they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher. \n That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year. \n It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents. \n Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up -- \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d -- as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties. \n Today, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 -- a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis. \n Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt -- an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust. \n \u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201d \n Airbnb Customers Vanish \n It doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only two\u00a0per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas. \n That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September. \n \n \n        var persistentPlayer = {\n            enabled: \"true\"\n        }\n     \n \n    $(document).ready(function(){\n        var adzone =  \"Real Estate\".replace(/ /g,\"_\").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '');\n        var VidiPlayer_1_1418168 = new BMVidiPlayer({\n                container: '.video-container_1_1418168', // container name that you append this video player in it.\n                config: 'bnn/autoplay-off.json' // configuration file path in http://ts-stash.production.ctv.ca/projects/VIDIWEB/repos/vidi-configs/browse\n            },\n            [ { contentId: 1934914, ad: { adsite: \"ctv.bnn\", adzone: adzone } } ] //contentId you want to play\n        );\n    });\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Little impact on April rents, but 'a lot of nervousness' around aid for May rent: CAPREIT CEO \n Mark Kenney, president and CEO of CAPREIT talks about the rental apartment market and how it's being affected by the pandemic. He says the \"overwhelming majority of apartment stock\" is owned by individuals and tenants need to know they have support from landlords, as well as government.  \n \n For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections. \n Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts -- who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 -- need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month. \n Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings. \n Shaky Pillars \n Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labor market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up. \n Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labor shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back. \n In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses. \n \u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201d \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "Pattie Lovett-Reid: 8 considerations for worried homeowners", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pattie-lovett-reid-8-considerations-for-worried-homeowners-1.1421193", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Apr 14, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Pattie Lovett-Reid\n                             \n Chief Financial Commentator, CTV   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Mounting job losses and concern that the real estate market will come to a full stop has many fearing property values will drop \u2013 and along with it their net worth.\u00a0 \n It stands to reason demand for homes will go down as people are unemployed and confidence declines. And those who in the past may have bought secondary properties for rental purposes are hesitant to do so as tenants struggle to make rent.\u00a0 \n The housing sector likely won\u2019t enjoy the typical spring bounce of past years.\u00a0 \n So what does this mean for you? Here are eight considerations for concerned homeowners.\u00a0\u00a0 \n 1.  Don't panic.  Like any asset, the only time you look at a current valuation is if you want to sell it.\u00a0 \r\n2.  If you have a job and are considered\u00a0an essential worker, ask your employer for verification . Lenders are more likely to support your situation and discuss refinancing options if they believe a steady stream of income is expected.\u00a0 \r\n3.  Fixed or variable?  If your mortgage is up for renewal, there are two considerations to make. One: If you are comfortable waiting things out, it\u2019s unlikely the Bank of Canada will be in position to increase rates anytime soon, so a variable rate may be right for you. Two: If your employment is iffy and your risk tolerance is low, keep in mind even higher fixed-mortgage rates are still incredibly low by any metric. You might want to consider consolidating all your debt into a fixed mortgage and lock it down. This may work in your favour if your goal is a lower monthly payment for all your debt for a sustained period of time.\u00a0 \r\n4.  Shop around for rates.  Now is not the time to overpay for your mortgage. If you have the risk tolerance to lock in for a shorter period, it might make sense and will be cheaper.\u00a0 In the interest of full disclosure, I understand the common sense to this approach, but I never had the risk tolerance for it. We locked in once we were comfortable with all the terms, time horizon, and rate.\u00a0 \r\n5.  HELCOs  (home equity line of credit) may be the option of choice for many. However, if home prices decrease so will your available line of credit. The good news if you do have one already, you can choose the option of interest-only payments for now, and try to resist the temptation to increase the principal amount. \r\n6.  Even if you don't need to now, it may be the time to refinance.  In times of prolonged economic uncertainty, job losses and employment fluctuations, appraisers and lenders will always be more hesitant to tilt to the high side of a valuation. You may also want to increase your amortization to lower your payments. Yes, you will pay more in interest, but that will be a discussion for another day for many households. \r\n7.  A mortgage deferral is not an interest-free mortgage holiday.  If you choose to defer, the interest accrued during the skipped periods will be added to the principal\u00a0balance. This will make a difference in how much you end up paying in interest over the life of the mortgage. For some, it is the lifeline they need right now. \r\n8.  Reverse mortgages could see a rise in popularity.  Reverse mortgages are loans for homeowners 55 years and older that allow them to access some of their home\u2019s equity without making a payment or forcing them to sell. However, a reverse mortgage loan ultimately does have to be repaid either when you move out of the home or when you die. There are some extenuating circumstances when the loan may need to be paid back sooner. For example, if the home is no longer your principal residence, you fail to pay your property taxes or homeowners insurance, or do not keep the home in good repair. \n Lenders are busy as homeowners explore financial options to offer themselves some breathing room during this period of uncertainty.\u00a0 These are stressful times, and managing your financial situation comes down to what is right for you. It\u2019s not one size fits all, so explore your options.\u00a0 \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Housing concern sends Canadian consumer confidence to new low", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/housing-concern-sends-canadian-consumer-confidence-to-new-low-1.1420838", "urlToImage": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1420839!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/homes-stand-in-this-aerial-photograph.png", "PublishedAt": "Apr 13, 2020", "content": "The historic slide in Canadian consumer confidence continued last week, with sentiment plumbing new depths as the nation braces for a prolonged slowdown. \n The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index, which is based on a telephone survey of households, declined sharply for a fourth week as extensive lockdowns continued to trigger mass layoffs. The index dropped to 38.7, by far the lowest reading since polling began in 2008. \n Signs have also emerged of troubles in the housing sector, with the survey showing Canadians have abruptly turned pessimistic about real estate. Some 41 per cent\u00a0of respondents now expect home prices to decline, the highest share for this question since the 2008 recession. A month ago, that number was at 13 per cent. \n A housing correction would compound and deepen what is already looking like one of the sharpest economic contractions since the Great Depression due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only has the real estate industry been a major contributor to economic growth, but housing has also been major source of wealth for millions of Canadians. \n \n Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for both the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 telephone responses. \n The survey paints a picture of heightened economic anxiety. \n \n Almost four out of five respondents (79 per cent) believe the nation\u2019s economy will get worse over the next six months, up from 74 per cent last week and more than double historical readings for this question. Until last month, the previous high was 57 per cent, during the 2008 recession \n The share of Canadians who say their personal finances have worsened over the past year rose to 36.9 per cent, also a record \n Concern about job security has spiked, with 22.3 per cent\u00a0of respondents saying they\u2019re at least somewhat worried about losing work. That\u2019s the highest since 2013 and about double the historic average for this question \n \n The abrupt deterioration in sentiment has occurred with the unprecedented shutdown of much of the nation\u2019s economy. \n The government received a total of 5.62 million emergency benefit claims since March 15, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough said Friday. That includes applications to a new program for workers and business owners who have lost income due to the pandemic. \n"}, {"source": null, "author": null, "title": "The Daily Chase: Kenney says Alberta saved Keystone XL, U.S. jobs plummet", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-kenney-says-alberta-saved-keystone-xl-u-s-jobs-plummet-1.1416909", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Apr 3, 2020", "content": "\n \n \n \n \n                                Noah Zivitz\n                             \n Managing Editor, BNN Bloomberg   Follow | Archive \n \n \n Alberta Premier Jason Kenney  gave us the distinct impression  late yesterday that after this year\u2019s global crash in oil prices, Keystone XL could very well have suffered the same fate as Energy East if not for his government\u2019s decision to invest directly in the project and provide a financial backstop. \u201cThe truth is this: Keystone XL would not be built if we did not step up to the plate,\u201d he told BNN Bloomberg, adding OPEC and Russia are \u201ctrying to drive us out of business...we can\u2019t leave our industry to sink or swim by itself.\u201d And on that note, he said he\u2019s in daily contact with the federal government about an emergency aid package, which he said needs to be \u201cnorth of $20 billion\u201d.

We're told to self-isolate, we're told to stay in, so how do you purchase a property, why are people still out there looking to purchase a property if that's the case?\" \n Real estate boards have recommended against open houses and even any in-person sales activity, but even doing things remotely through video and virtual tours requires a team to go through the house including stagers, photographers, and a floor plan assessor, he said. \n Slavens said he's concerned that because the market was in such a frenzy before the outbreak hit, new listings are too tempting for those who were in the market. \n \"When properties are put out, it's like putting candy in front of a baby, we can't expect our buyers to not want to go out and see these properties.\" \n He said he's only helping clients who are truly in a bind, such a family who recently moved from the U.K. and are stuck in an Airbnb, but doesn't think people should be listing properties if they don't have to. \n \"Bringing out something because someone wants to sell right now is just wrong, it's wrong.\" \n Said Warde, a Toronto-based realtor with Royal LePage, said he's only taking out people who are in a situation where they need to buy, and would try to dissuade those simply looking for a bargain from shopping for a home right now. \n \"Some buyers might a bit selfishly, if they're not in the need, try to sort of score a deal and take advantage of the fact that there's less competition going on, but if that's going to be your strategy, and that's not something you need to do, I would talk you out.\" \n Ontario Real Estate Association president Sean Morrison said the designation of realtors in the province as an essential service means it should be used only when necessary. \n \"This should only be for essential transactions at this point, this is not business as usual.\" \n The association has particularly urged realtors to recommend clients avoid in-person showings when the homes are occupied by tenants, who otherwise often have little say in the matter. \n Morrison said that overall the board is definitely seeing a drop in activity, but that it's too soon to say what kind of long-term impact the outbreak might have. \n The Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers said Wednesday in a release that the number of sales in the Montreal area is growing at a slower pace than in previous weeks, but is still higher than it was last year during the same period. \n The association, however, notes that new listings are down and it says that \"the number of listings should drop rapidly in the coming weeks,\" because of government action on the virus. \n Those realtors who are still showing properties are taking increasingly stringent precautions. \n Alaina Burnett, a realtor with ReMax in Vancouver, said the company has come out with a waiver for showings that instructs clients not to touch anything and not to bring children if they can't be controlled. \n She said she's also driving to showings in separate vehicles from clients, keeping a distance in the homes, using lots of hand sanitizer and even taking fire escape staircases to avoid the confined space of elevators. \n \"We just have to do it in as cautious a way as we can.\" \n She said she's still seeing a fair bit of activity, with 201 new listings and 136 units sold Wednesday in just the areas of the city she monitors for clients. \n \"Things are still being listed and still selling, so things are chugging along.\" \n She said she tries to lay out the situation to clients but that it's ultimately up to them to decide. \n \"People have to weigh the risks with their own personal needs and agendas.\" \n \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Pandemic causes sharp drop in Canadians searching for homes", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pandemic-causes-sharp-drop-in-canadians-searching-for-homes-1.1412232", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 25, 2020", "content": "Canadians\u2019 interest in searching for houses online is waning amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to real estate portal Point2 Homes. \n Canadian home searches on the website were 38 per cent\u00a0lower on March 23 compared to March 5, according to data from the real estate marketplace, which is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Bank of Canada and the country\u2019s biggest commercial banks are pulling out all the stops to try and head off a serious recession. \n The central bank has now cut interest rates a full percentage point to 0.75% in the past two weeks, spurring mortgage rates lower, and it may cut again. The banking regulator is loosening bank capital requirements to free up C$300 billion of lending capacity. \n Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s six biggest lenders, including Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank, said they would consider six-month mortgage-payment deferrals for small businesses and individual borrowers impacted by the pandemic. \n In the longer run, relentless demand means any pullback will likely be short-lived and prices should hold up, said Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC. \n \u201cIn all likelihood, this will be a temporary hit with a rebound taking place later this year once the COVID-19 situation settles down -- though the timing and magnitude of the rebound are highly uncertain at this point,\u201d Hogue said in a research note this week. \n \n Immigration Bump \n Re/Max, one of the nation\u2019s biggest brokerages, on Tuesday urged its 18,000 brokers across the country to cancel all open houses. In Vancouver, developers are closing sales centers and construction sites will be impacted as building activity is interrupted, according to Anne McMullin, president of the Urban Development Institute, an industry group. \n But underpinning the market is the fastest pace population growth in 30 years, driven in large part by immigration, and the appeal of Canadian real estate to those with cash to deploy at uncertain times, including foreign buyers. \n In Montreal, a New-York based buyer just made an offer on a property listed at more than C$2 million after a virtual visit, said Debby Doktorczyk, owner of Engel & Volkers Montreal, which counts 175 brokers. \n Momentum helps. The housing market entered the spring selling season on a high, with sales across the country up 25 per cent\u00a0from February 2019. Toronto and Vancouver home resales surged about 44 per cent\u00a0from the same month a year ago, while Montreal\u2019s were up about 23 per cent. \n The market was extremely strong -- if not a bit \u201ccrazy\u201d -- before the pandemic, says Doktorczyck. Now, \u201cinstead of getting 15 offers for a property, we\u2019re getting five,\u201d she said, adding virtual visits are likely to become more common. \n Market Oxygen \n Even in Vancouver, which was only just emerging from its worst year in decades before the coronavirus, Royal LePage broker Adil Dinani says his shop is still doing 90\u00a0per cent\u00a0of the deals expected. \n Dinani was up past midnight negotiating the sale of a $2.3 million, six-bedroom home in an affluent suburb just outside Vancouver. The open house on Sunday had drawn 40 groups -- some 85 eager buyers undeterred by the virus -- who waited to enter one group at a time. The property drew seven offers, including the winner -- an all-cash bid, almost $150,000 above asking. \n While open houses may be suspended, home buyers can still see homes by appointment, say agents. Meanwhile falling mortgage rates will act as a spur. Borrowers can now get a five-year variable mortgage at 2.1\u00a0per cent\u00a0and a three-year fixed at 1.99 per cent, according to RateSpy.com. \n \u201cYou know the saying -- oxygen for any real estate market is low interest rates,\u201d said Dinani at Royal LePage in Vancouver. \u201cWell interest rates just got lower. There\u2019s a lot more room to move in Canada. That prime rate can come down more, unlike the U.S. and other nations that are pretty much operating near zero. \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Home builders show strength in Canada, buffer weakening economy", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/home-builders-show-strength-in-canada-buffer-weakening-economy-1.1402541", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Mar 9, 2020", "content": "Canadian housing starts remained at elevated levels in February, amid strength in the detached-home market. \n Work began on an annualized 210,069 units, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said in a statement Monday.

That\u2019s more than three times the country\u2019s GDP growth in 2019. Uninsured mortgages grew 12 per cent\u00a0to $759.4 billion. In contrast, insured loans declined 4.6 per cent\u00a0to $469.5 billion over the same period, as the Federal government has sought in recent years to limit taxpayer exposure to the real estate sector. \n Lenders create mortgage-backed notes by packaging property loans into securities of varying risk and expected return, and there\u2019s been little evidence that risky mortgages have become a prominent feature in Canada\u2019s RMBS market. In addition, mortgages are \u201cfull recourse\u201d in most of the country, meaning lenders can pursue borrowers even after they\u2019ve walked away from the property. \n With a securitization deal the seller of the underlying assets can reduce the regulatory capital needed to be set aside to cover potential losses should they meet certain conditions, which includes transferring significant credit risk to third parties. The seller would need to hold capital for any securitization tranches retained. \n TD Securities will offer only the safest portion of the transaction, specifically the bullet-pay class A notes, retaining the mezzanine and junior pieces, a person familiar with the matter said. Back in 2017, Bank of Montreal created a $1.96-billion RMBS deal, though much of the securities were purchased and retained by the bank itself, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said at that time. \n The Canadian Fixed-Income Forum, a Bank of Canada-led group made up of bond-market professionals, has been working for around two years to expand interest in RMBS. Part of their efforts include a proposed public mortgage database, the details of which would be ironed out by a working group co-chaired by the central bank, the CMHC, representatives from the six largest banks and the Canadian Bankers Association on behalf of the smaller players, according to a presentation given in October. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Condo gains push Canadian housing starts to a 4-month high", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/condo-gains-push-canadian-housing-starts-to-a-4-month-high-1.1387783", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Feb 10, 2020", "content": "Canadian builders began 2020 with a strong rebound in housing starts that is good news for the nation\u2019s increasingly tight real estate markets. \n Work began on an annualized 213,224 units in January, up 8.8 per cent from a revised 195,892 in the prior month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Monday in a statement.

A recent correction in prices for new single-family homes also helped sales in that segment. \n \u201cThe improvement in new single-family home sales in 2019 was aided by the narrowing of the price gap between new single-family homes and new condominium apartments, as well as fewer competing options in the resale home market as inventories were whittled down,\u201d Patricia Arsenault, executive vice president of data solutions at Altus, said in the report. \n Newly built single-family homes still represent the most expensive segment of Toronto\u2019s residential real estate market, and have been one of the most volatile in recent years.

The 65-year-old firm, run by the late founder\u2019s three sons and four grandsons, was a catalyst in extending Toronto\u2019s downtown toward Lake Ontario to what\u2019s now known as the South Core. \n \u201cWe\u2019re midway through a 20-year development cycle of our own where we\u2019ll deliver just about 8 million square feet on the waterfront,\u201d Sean Menkes said. \n Menkes projects include Sugar Wharf, a 4.6-million-square-foot development with a 25-story office tower that will be the future headquarters of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario and the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 75,000 square feet of retail, five condo towers and a 2-acre park. \n Down the road is another Menkes project, a 475,000 square foot office complex that will be home to London-based marketing firm WPP Plc and tech hub MaRS. \n \u201cI continue to believe in the waterfront,\u201d Sean Menkes said. \u201cWe have a lot going on here and I don\u2019t see us stopping.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Nic Querolo and Olivia Rockeman", "title": "This could be America's priciest home ever \u2014 if it can find a buyer", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/this-could-be-america-s-priciest-home-ever-if-it-can-find-a-buyer-1.1381367", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jan 29, 2020", "content": "America's priciest home is finally getting its finishing touches. \n Seven years after he started working\u00a0on \u201cThe One,\u201d a 100,000-square-foot mansion in Bel-Air, movie producer turned developer Nile Niami says he's just about\u00a0ready to test the market with his ballyhooed US$500 million asking price. \n Replete with a\u00a0nightclub, four swimming pools, bowling alley and 360-degree vistas of sun-dappled Southern California,\u00a0 the symbol of America\u2019s latest gilded age\u00a0has generated a flood of media coverage since the proposed price was announced in 2015. \n And while\u00a0permitting problems, construction delays and financing issues have exposed the struggles of building luxury homes on speculation, and raised questions about whether the project high above Los Angeles would ever be finished, Niami says he\u2019s almost done.\u00a0 And he\u2019s not backing off the lofty price tag, which would make the house the most expensive in America. \n \u201cWhen you have something that\u2019s as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want for it,\u201d Niami said in an interview, arguing that recent nine-figure property property deals in Los Angeles and elsewhere\u00a0are proof that his pricing strategy was not just about generating press. \u201cWhen the house was started, I had no basis to ask US$500 million\u2014\u00a0now\u00a0there are so many triple-digit sales in L.A. and the world that\u00a0the asking price is not unreasonable anymore.\u201d \n Niami admits the pressure of his development\u00a0odyssey has aged him prematurely.\u00a0\u00a0Building mega-mansions without a buyer lined up can be precarious. Cost overruns and delays are common, carrying costs are high,\u00a0and shifting appetites for luxury are hard to predict.

It\u2019s a very small, very tight market.\u201d \n Niami says that\u2019s not a problem. Los Angeles has tried\u00a0to limit\u00a0\u00a0the construction of new mega-mansions, meaning nothing like The One\u00a0can be built again, the developer said. And while one amenity that got a lot of attention \u2014\u00a0a room with tanks of live jellyfish lining the walls \u2014\u00a0has been dropped\u00a0because it was too much work,\u00a0Niami said he\u2019s got something planned that\u2019s\u00a0 \u201ceven better.\u2019\u2019He hasn\u2019t yet let anyone inside the property, but says\u00a0the special features have helped draw interest from potential buyers. He\u2019s talking to them now, but\u00a0declined to provide details, citing privacy issues. The One\u2019s unveiling will happen once the final interior decorating is done, Niami said. \n \u201cI\u2019ve had potential buyers a long time on this,\u2019\u2019 Niami said. \u201cWe have a list of very real, verifiable buyers that we will bring in soon.\u201d \n Pricing homes above their market value, a strategy known as \u201caspirational pricing,\u201d is a way for a developer to get attention for ultra-luxury listings.\u00a0 A sale at the half-billion-dollar asking price would be more than double the biggest residential real estate deal in the U.S. to date -- a $238\u00a0 million penthouse purchased by Citadel founder Ken Griffin in Manhattan. Niami points out that Griffin\u2019s place is an apartment, with no land, while The One sits on 3\u00a0acres. \n \u201cThe Billionaire,\u201d\u00a0another Bel-Air spec house that briefly was the most-expensive home for sale in America, was\u00a0originally listed by developer Bruce Makowsky for $250 million.\u00a0The 38,000-square-foot mansion, with wine cellars, pools, a bowling alley, helipad and \u201ccandy room,\u201d sold for $94 million in October, a 62% price cut. \n A Los Angeles native raised by a single mother who was\u00a0 a special education teacher, Niami started out as a makeup artist in the move industry.\u00a0 He eventually became a producer and his\u00a0credits include \u201cThe Patriot,\u201d starring Steven Seagal, and\u00a0\u201cPoint Blank,\u201d\u00a0with\u00a0Mickey Rourke. His turn to real estate came when he began\u00a0remodeling condos.\u00a0 \n Niami\u00a0has two additional multimillion-dollar projects in Bel-Air. On a neighboring hillside, another of his properties, 10701 Bellagio Road, took three price cuts after being listed in 2018 for $65 million. A notice of intent to revoke permits on that property, and on another US$65 million Niami-owned mansion directly behind it, were issued by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. \n \u201cWhen you have something as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want\u201d \n Without those permits, the properties can\u2019t be legally occupied.\u00a0 After several meetings, the issues are close to being resolved, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. Still, the properties have been taken off the market, he said. \n That leaves The One. Niami took out a two-year US$82.5 million loan from Hankey Capital, which specializes\u00a0in high-interest bridge financing,\u00a0to help finish the construction. He's current on the debt payments and faces an October deadline to repay the money, according to Hankey. Niami declined to comment on the rate of his loan. \n While\u00a0very few super-luxury homes sell each year, there was an uptick in 2019. Last year, 23 homes went\u00a0for US$50 million or more in the U.S., the most since 2014, according to Miller. Six of those sold for at least US$100 million.\u201cThe One is absolutely no issue,\u201d Niami said.\u00a0 \u201cThe value is definitely there.\u201d \n --With assistance from Edvard Pettersson and Hailey Waller. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Jeff Kearns", "title": "U.S. new home sales fall to five-month low, missing forecasts", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-new-home-sales-fall-to-five-month-low-missing-forecasts-1.1380280", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jan 27, 2020", "content": "Sales of new U.S. homes cooled for a third month in December, signalling a potential pullback after purchases climbed to some of the best levels in more than a decade amid lower borrowing costs and a solid labour market. \n Single-family home sales fell 0.4 per cent\u00a0to a 694,000 annualized pace, the weakest since July and below all economist estimates in Bloomberg's survey, while the November figure was revised down to 697,000, government data showed Monday.

And while critics blame past rate cuts for inflaming home prices, the health of the housing market is not the bank\u2019s mandate. \n That would be low and stable inflation. \n So with that in mind, BNN Bloomberg asked several of our regular guests how much the housing market will play into Bank of Canada\u2019s rate decisions this year. \n Here\u2019s what they had to say: \n \u201cI still think [Poloz] is wary about the potential that the Bank might cause a renewed period of speculative housing activity in some parts of the country if it cut rates. The way I think about it is that it\u2019s not a barrier to cutting rates per se, but rather a barrier to making small adjustments to policy like some other countries have done. \n The Bank\u2019s models are probably telling it that it should cut interest rates by 25 basis points, but in the grand scheme of things the effect of such a cut on GDP and inflation would be small. They have to trade that small benefit against the risk that they cause a renewed period of speculative activity in the housing market.\u201d \n \u2014 Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist,\u00a0Capital Economics.

Here's how Poloz responded. \n \n \n \u201cNo one should underestimate the BoC's laser focus on its most vital responsibility. The Bank's mandate ensures that its 18-to-24 month inflation projections override virtually all other considerations. \n It's highly unlikely that housing strength would keep the BoC from stimulating the economy if inflation expectations started plummeting. Sufficient economic firewalls are in place. Macroprudential policy is one of them. The government's mortgage stress tests, default insurance restrictions and stricter capital rules all serve to lower the risk of BoC policy exacerbating housing instability.\u201d \n \u2014Rob McLister, founder, RateSpy \n \n \u201cShort answer, yes, it\u2019s a dilemma \u2014\u00a0but a few things: \n \u2022 The strong jump in home prices in places like the GTA in the third quarter is probably unsustainable (due to pent up demand in the past few quarters). So it\u2019s possible the housing inflation will moderate and will make the BoC\u2019s life a bit easier. \r\n\u2022 B-20 (the mortgage stress test) is still around and acts as a negative. \r\n\u2022\u00a0The (Bank of Canada\u2019s posted) five-year rate went up notably, a negative. \r\n\u2022\u00a0And a 25-basis-point cut by the Bank will not impact the five-year rate much and will have little impact on borrowing costs. \n I think that given all the above, the housing market will probably not prevent the bank from moving, by say 25 basis points, if they believe that will prevent, say, a dollar appreciation.\u201d \n \u2014Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist, CIBC Capital Markets \n \n \u201cThe BoC is painted into a corner of sorts. All signs are that the next change in rates is likely to be a cut\u00a0and while the broader economy may eventually need that, the BoC recognizes how a rate cut can impact speculative buying in the housing market. \n It's going to be a challenge to balance these different priorities - lower rates to improve our overall economy knowing that it can present even more risks to our housing market and household debt in the future.\u201d \n \u2014John Pasalis, president, Realosophy Realty\u00a0\u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "BNN Bloomberg", "author": "Nicole Gibillini", "title": "Toronto rental construction ramped up in 2019 amid low vacancy rates", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/toronto-rental-construction-ramped-up-in-2019-amid-low-vacancy-rates-1.1375582", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Jan 17, 2020", "content": "The number of rental units under construction in the Greater Toronto Area has reached the highest level in about 50 years, according to market research firm Urbanation Inc. \n The report released Friday said at the end of 2019 the number of purpose-built rentals under construction in the GTA reached 12,367 units, the highest level since the 1970s. \n While the number of rental units that began construction last year declined to 4,172 units from 5,620 the previous year, the number of units that were completed grew to 3,630, the highest level since the early 1990s. \n The data come on the heels of a report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. earlier this week that revealed the national vacancy rate for purpose-built rental apartments hit a 17-year low of 2.2 per cent in 2019. \n \u201c2019 may be remembered as an important year in the history of the GTA rental market, as the progress made towards increasing supply could mark the beginning of a new era for rental housing development in the region,\u201d said Urbanation President Shaun Hildebrand in a release Friday. \u201cBut it\u2019s critical that this momentum continues in the years to come in order to eventually bring the market into balance.\u201d \n \u200bThere are indications that the momentum will continue, as 2019 saw a 43-per-cent rise in submissions for purpose-built unit development compared with the previous year.

He said the board, which has restrictions including no scraping, mining, or monetizing of the data, is looking to protect its intellectual property and defend personal information. \n \"We are currently in the process of auditing and protecting confidential information in TREB's database, which is what our members and consumers expect and what the law demands.\" \n Aware of privacy concerns, real estate site Zoocasa has taken down some price history information on request, generally a couple a month, said CEO Lauren Haw. \n Overall though, the data has allowed the company to provide more information and will play into a range of better tools and valuation features it plans to unveil in the coming months to help people better predict price changes. \n \"This does allow us to better innovate, in terms of the data interpretation that we're providing,\" she said. \r\nAnd despite privacy concerns, the Supreme Court ruling has prompted real estate boards in other major cities including Vancouver, Calgary and Ottawa to open up their data online, while \n Quebec's amalgamated board is considering the issue. \n The competition bureau said it has been generally pleased with how other boards have reacted, and that \"most\" have implemented new rules, but did not provide specific numbers. \n But even as the openness of information increases and new companies enter the market, the overall market does not look to have changed all that much, said Queen's University real estate professor John Andrew. \n \"Most people aren't accessing the data that is available, so I don't see really that it's had a very profound impact on the market,\" he said. \n \"I kind of made the prediction that this might be kind of the next step of several in the general trend towards the liberalization of data, and that really hasn't happened, to my surprise.\" \n He had expected more Canadians would follow the growth in the U.S. of flat-rate listings and other ways to reduce commissions, where the cost savings are \"simply staggering,\" but the vast majority are sticking with the standard model. \n \"I think it's just about the consumers' confidence level. They're dealing with their home, and by far their largest investment.\" \n Pollard, who had listed his condo privately, decided after a quick test of the option to go with a realtor. He said one of the big trade-offs in paying a commission was the greater potential for multiple bidders. \n \"There's definitely benefits of having a realtor, and I'm seeing that right now actually, the fact they know how to price it, they have the network.

You can get a mortgage now for around 2.5 per cent for five years where a year ago you would be paying somewhere above three per cent.\" \n He said the average value of a home in B.C. dropped 2.4 per cent in 2019 to $522,000, but that same home value is expected to increase 3.8 per cent next year and by another four per cent in 2021. \n Yu said the median home price in Metro Vancouver dropped about 10 per cent from last year and is currently at about $690,000. In Victoria, the median home price is $600,000. \n He said the rental vacancy rate in most B.C. urban centres remains tight at slightly more than one per cent, while rents are expected to increase by 4.5 per cent for tenants looking for new homes. \n The B.C. government's most recent financial quarterly report released in September said home sales decreased by more than 16 per cent from January to July 2019 compared with the same period in 2018. \n The government's report said Metro Vancouver home sales from January to July 2019 fell 21.5 per cent compared to the first seven months of 2018. \n Yu said the coming months will see the resale market rebuild but double-digit price increases are not expected. \n \"I don't think there's a lot of downside for this,\" he said. \"As we see the migration flows coming in, the population growth numbers and the tight labour market, those (factors) should be enough to provide some stimulus. It's not going to be heading to the level you saw pre-stress test, but prices are on the rise again in our view.\" \n \n"}, {"source": null, "author": "Jared Dillian, Bloomberg Opinion", "title": "'Very vocal' short seller warns on betting against Canada", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/very-vocal-short-seller-warns-on-betting-against-canada-1.1352069", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Nov 22, 2019", "content": "Canada has been a primary target for short sellers since 2013. The principal reasons are the country\u2019s very expensive housing, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, and consumer debt levels that are among the highest in the world. Canada also has an expansive private mortgage market that supplies credit when banks won\u2019t. It is hard to argue with the vulnerabilities. And yet the Canadian housing market hasn\u2019t collapsed. \n I have been a very vocal short seller of Canada, and I am not ready to declare the trade officially over even though the stock market has reached new highs and the local currency has strengthened. But I do acknowledge the big reason why the trade hasn\u2019t worked out as planned: Immigration. \n Canada has a very liberal immigration policy that doesn\u2019t seem to be as controversial as it would be in the U.S. Canada allows 250,000 to 300,000 immigrants to enter the country legally every year, which is about one per cent\u00a0of the population. No matter where you go in the country, society is exceptionally diverse. Complaints like those recently from hockey commentator Don Cherry are pretty rare. Immigration works, and it\u2019s a huge economic engine. In simplest terms, gross domestic product is output, and if you have more people working at a constant level of productivity, you have more output. \n \n Billy Ray Cyrus holds up a Canadian Flag during the 2019 Canadian Country Music Awards at Scotiabank Saddledome on September 8, 2019 in Calgary, Alberta. Getty Images North America/Derek Leung \n \n Sure, Canada has a few economic issues besides a heated housing market. Its most important industry, energy, is in a sort of perma-recession. The government refuses to allow the construction of pipelines, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s carbon taxes are a drag on growth. Still, population growth \u2014 mostly through immigration \u2014 is strong and have made up for those negatives. \n Various economic studies have shown that countries where the population is declining suffer from low growth and low inflation. Conversely, those with growing populations have faster growth and positive inflation. The economic riddle that is Japan is pretty easy to figure out: Deflation won\u2019t reverse until the population decline reverses. Japan\u2019s fertility has declined for cultural and technological reasons. If Japan continues to restrict immigration, it will continue to experience deflation, no matter how much currency they print. Demographics are the primary driver of inflation and interest rates, and nothing else. \n Attracting talent from around the world should be a top priority for just about any country. It has pretty much prevented Canada from doing lasting economic harm to itself after some questionable decision-making. Immigration alone is the primary reason that the famed Canada housing short trade hasn\u2019t worked.\u00a0 The number of people in Canada rose 1.4 per cent\u00a0in July from\u00a0a year earlier, the biggest\u00a0increase since 1990 and the\u00a0fastest growth among the Group of Seven countries, according to Bloomberg\u00a0News. \n Canada\u2019s\u00a0consumer debt problem is a different issue altogether. Canadians have a comfort level with debt that Americans no longer do, so they never really deleveraged following the global financial crisis. As for real estate, it was an obsession in Canada for a while, and I still hear crazy stories, though most of the madness seemed to have happened in 2017, when Home Capital Group needed a bailout from Warren Buffett, and Pitbull and Tony Robbins were hawking properties at something called the Real Estate Wealth Expo in Toronto. Don\u2019t forget the money from China flowing into West Vancouver houses for various reasons. \n For a while, people were of the belief that the Bank of Canada was going to boost interest rates and pop the housing bubble, but now it seems like Governor Stephen Poloz is acknowledging the risks to the Canadian economy, or at least realizes that he can\u2019t have too much an interest rate differential with the U.S. If the central bank cuts rates, it is unlikely housing will go down. \n This has been going on for more than six years. It is expensive to finance a losing trade for six years. You either have to declare the idea a failure, or put it in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d pile. And given that correlations across countries is pretty high, the downturn in Canada will probably be synchronous with the U.S. and the rest of the world, so it\u2019s all the same trade. \n There are still risks. \u00a0Debt is still high, and a second Trudeau term is not going to make things any easier for the Albertans. Secession is being discussed openly. But population growth can cover up a lot of mistakes. I\u2019m still not crazy about Canada, but I think any short seller at this point has to admit that this is going to happen on a timeline that is too long for most people to endure. \n Jared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of \"Street Freak\" and \"All the Evil of This World.\" He may have a stake in the areas he writes about. \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Outside housing, Canadian capital growth is near a 60-year low", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/outside-housing-canadian-capital-growth-is-near-a-60-year-low-1.1351544", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Nov 21, 2019", "content": "Canada suffered another bad year of investment, extending the weakest run of capital growth outside the housing sector in nearly six decades. \n The value of non-residential capital rose just one per cent\u00a0in 2018, reflecting the third straight year of historically sluggish investment.

The reversal has come in part as governments erected barriers to slow runaway price growth driven \u2014\u00a0at least in part \u2014\u00a0by all the billionaire investors who came before. \n The winners were cities such as Moscow, as rich Russians chose to buy at home, and Taipei, favored over Hong Kong, the world\u2019s most expensive housing market. \n \n Even as the flow of investment has slowed, many developers are delivering projects started when the supply of rich buyers seemed to go on forever.

While the levies effectively raised prices even further, they also provided governments with extra cash for city services, as foreign buyers don\u2019t pay income taxes. On the other hand, rich buyers also spend money on goods and services that boost local economies and sales tax revenue. \n Prices got too high and economic conditions changed, said Thomas Veraguth, the Zurich-based head of global real estate strategy for UBS Wealth Management. Waves of Middle Eastern and Russian buyers pulled back, for example, after the oil crash in 2014, he said. \n \u201cIt\u2019s fatigue,\u201d Veraguth said. \u201cEven the richest will say, \u2019I\u2019m not going to pay that price anymore.\u201d \n Markets are shifting based on local conditions, said Kate Everett-Allen, a partner at Knight Frank in London. The U.S. election may cause buyers to pause in New York while the stability of the Swiss franc will continue to drive demand in Zurich and Geneva, she said. \n Moscow had the biggest price increase in Knight Frank\u2019s study, rising 11 per cent. With Russia under international sanctions after its annexation of Crimea, and anti-money laundering measures tightened in London and other cities favored by that country\u2019s elite, many opt to buy property at home. Developers also completed a number of luxury properties in the Russian capital, increasing supply. \n Russia has plenty of rich people. There are at least 189,500 ultra-high net worth individuals in the country controlling about US$1.1 trillion, according to Capgemini estimates. It\u2019s also incredibly unequal. There are 23 Russians on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people, worth about a combined US$271 billion. \n In total, there are more than 100 Russians with more than US$1 billion. \n Chinese buyers have slowed overseas purchases, in part because of government restrictions on getting money out. And buyers everywhere are dodging risk, skipping Hong Kong, the world\u2019s most expensive market and one now with political unrest, in favor of Taipei, which saw an 8.9 per cent\u00a0price increase in the third quarter. \n While Brexit and taxes on second homebuyers make London riskier and more expensive, buyers bid up prices by 10 per cent\u00a0in Frankfurt, which is a banking capital with relatively affordable prices. \n When things go sideways around the globe, the U.S. has traditionally served as an island of safety and security, particularly for the world\u2019s wealthy. The U.S. is already home to more Hong Kongers than any country outside of mainland China, and recent data suggest more are looking to leave. Applications for a key emigration document, the \u201cgood citizenship card,\u201d are up 54 per cent\u00a0in the past year, according to official data. \n But anti-immigrant political rhetoric, high-profile incidences of gun violence and impending changes to the \u201cinvestor visa\u201d program have encouraged Hong Kong\u2019s would-be emigres to consider alternatives such as Australia, Canada, Singapore and Taiwan. \n \u201cEverybody\u2019s pulling back \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s a crazy time,\u201d Edward Mermelstein, a partner at One & Only Holdings in New York, which runs family offices for foreigners. \u201cThe wealthy have always been an easy target and now that\u2019s a popular theme globally.

That's up by more than 12,500 from a year ago, double the level of five years ago, and almost five times the number that were being built a decade ago. \n The recent growth \u2014\u00a0propelled by a combination of a rising population, increasingly out-of-reach homeownership and a lack of rental supply \u2014\u00a0has come about gradually enough that many haven't noticed, said Boukall. \n \"It's come along slowly, where I don't think it has shown up on a lot of people's radar.\" \n The market, however, is now booming, with record investment of $8.3 billion last year according to real estate firm CBRE, while PwC said in its latest real estate outlook that the sector's landscape is \"stronger than it has been at any other time in history.\" \n The resurgence in dedicated rental buildings is important because they provide more stability for renters than individual condo rentals, which owners can take off the market with little notice, while many cities are desperate for new rental stock to address extremely low vacancy rates. \n The low vacancy rates, which are under one per cent in Toronto and Vancouver, have pushed rents up in major cities, helping to attract more institutional and private equity investors who like the improving returns on rentals as well as the long-term cash flows they provide. \n Rental builds also provide diversification for big developers, like RioCan and Oxford Properties, which have been looking to make better use of the sprawling footprint of their mall parking lots and retail spaces. \n Oxford started to push into the rental space a decade ago, and says it now sees the increased demand for rentals as a permanent shift. \n \"With demographic changes, and lifestyle changes, we just think that that's structural, that more people, or an increasing part of the population, is going to choose to rent over owning a home,\" said Tyler Seaman, head of multi-residential for North America at Oxford. \n Oxford, the real estate investment arm of the Ontario municipal pension fund, started into rentals by buying existing stock, but steadily rising prices for buildings and general lack of supply have pushed it and others into building more of their own. \n \"Development is going to be an increasingly important part of our program,\" said Seaman. \n By building new, developers can add the amenities and build quality renters have come to expect after renting in condo developments, he said. \n To make the economics work, many developers are relying on rental rates at the higher end of the spectrum, but Seaman said Oxford also plans to build mid-market rentals as it expands rentals from about six per cent of its portfolio to somewhere between 10 and 20 per cent. \n Developers are also seeing the value of holding on to increasingly scarce land in big cities. \n At a real estate panel in early October, Dream Unlimited chief financial officer Pauline Alimchandani said the company was shifting from condo to rental developments to preserve their land base in Toronto. \n \"Pretty much almost all of it, we're planning on building and owning for the long term. That is a big shift from where we were when we went public just a few years ago.\" \n Condo builds, however, still dominate in Toronto and Vancouver, in part because high land costs make the quick payout of condo buildings more attractive, and because condo developers already control so much of the land base, said Boukall at Altus. \n In Toronto there were about 7,800 rental units under construction in September, compared with 56,000 condo units. In Vancouver, where a softer condo market has pushed some developers to shift to rentals, there were 9,300 rentals to 31,400 condos. Montreal had 14,700 rentals under development compared with 10,500 condos. \n The boom in rentals could go a long way to addressing low vacancy rates in many cities, but is still far off what's needed to offset a rising population for Toronto. A recent RBC report determined that Toronto would have to build an average of 26,800 units per year to bring vacancy rates up to a healthy three per cent over, while build rates in other cities look like they could address gaps in a couple years. \n \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Prashant Gopal and Christopher Condon", "title": "Trump's trade war tumult hands surprise boost to housing market", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trump-s-trade-war-tumult-hands-surprise-boost-to-housing-market-1.1340812", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Oct 31, 2019", "content": "Donald Trump, America\u2019s first property-developer president, helped lift the housing market out of its recent slump. All it took was chaotic tweeting, and an unpredictable trade war that\u2019s put investors on edge. \n \u201cPerhaps the only beneficiary of President Trump\u2019s trade war is housing, at least for the time being,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe war has undermined the economy and pushed down mortgage rates.\u201d \n Trump has thrown conventional housing wisdom out the door. When the economy is strong, as it is now, rates typically rise and investors leave the relative safety of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. \n One of the surprises of the Trump era is that chaos has been the best medicine for housing, at least in the short run. The trade war with China has slowed global economies, and borrowing costs have plunged, even with U.S. unemployment at the lowest in 50 years. \n Mortgage rates remain near historic lows. The 30-year fixed rate dropped to 3.49 per cent\u00a0last month, the lowest level in almost three years, and a full percentage point lower than a year earlier. That drop boosted sales by 117,000, about 35 per cent\u00a0more than would be expected, based on a CoreLogic Inc. analysis of data starting in 1971. Last September, after a 0.8-per-cent\u00a0rise in rates, sales plunged by 173,000. \n What might seem like small changes to mortgage rates are having bigger consequences than they have in the past because today\u2019s buyers are struggling with affordability. \n \n MENDING MARKET \n The global economic uncertainty fuelled by trade disputes has helped the housing market mend. Contracts to purchase previously owned homes in September posted the largest annual increase in four years, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. And the homeownership rate in the third quarter rose for the first time this year, as renters flooded back into the purchase market. \n Trump, a real estate tycoon, knows the power of low rates. He has harangued the Federal Reserve \u2014\u00a0first criticizing it for hiking too much, and more recently for failing to cut more aggressively. The Fed cut rates for the third time in 2019 on Wednesday. \n Even as housing picks up steam, mortgage rates have started to creep up in recent weeks. The average for a 30-year fixed loan climbed to 3.78 per cent\u00a0this week, the highest since July, Freddie Mac data show. Zandi expects rates to climb above four per cent\u00a0this year if Trump and China strike a deal, which could be enough to extinguish the fledgling market rebound. \n Chinese officials are casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the U.S. even as the two sides get close to signing a \u201cphase one\u201d agreement, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. \n \u201cHousing\u2019s on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cIf mortgage rates rise even modestly, the housing market will go from rip roaring to a deep freeze.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cOver in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money. Don\u2019t we have to follow our competitors?\u201d  @Varneyco  Yes we do. The Fed doesn\u2019t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway! \r\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  October 29, 2019 \n \n \n ECONOMIC TURMOIL \n While the drop in interest rates has helped homebuyers in the short term, there\u2019s an argument that those benefits are secondary to the larger economic turmoil bubbling up around the globe. Gross domestic product in the third quarter grew at a 1.9 per cent annual rate, the lowest since the end of 2018, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday. \n \u201cI don\u2019t look at this is as being great for the customer,\u201d said Eric DeBello, owner of CHM Mortgage Group in Marshfield, Massachusetts. \u201cFrom a macro standpoint, this stuff isn\u2019t good.\u201d \n It\u2019s also tricky for investors who are deciding how much to allocate to mortgage bonds. Uncertainty can\u2019t be easily measured in financial models and algorithms, said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital. \n \u201cBefore, unpredictability used to be whether unemployment was going to be bad or good -- now it\u2019s a tweet,\u201d Buchta said. \u201cFor investors, that\u2019s dangerous because they get whipsawed by things.\u201d \n"}, {"source": "The Canadian Press", "author": null, "title": "CMHC: Housing market to recover in next two years after declines", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cmhc-housing-market-to-recover-in-next-two-years-after-declines-1.1336929", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Oct 24, 2019", "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada's federal housing agency expects the housing market to recover in the next two years after declines in home building, sales and prices. \n Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said in its annual market outlook Thursday that housing starts should come in at around 200,000 units in the next two years.

The amount to be paid back is determined on the value of the home at the time of repayment. \n Phil Soper, president of Royal LePage, said he wasn't supportive of the Conservative's plan to cut the mortgage stress test because supply need to be addressed before government props up more demand, but also sees the vacancy tax as having little effect. \n He would like to see Liberals improve on the national housing strategy they brought forward in the last term, which he said was the first federal modern effort to bring all three levels of government together to address housing shortages. \n \"I believe now they'll probably move it farther along in terms of its ability to bring more housing to our biggest cities.\" \n In 2017, the Liberals introduced a 10-year, $55-billion housing strategy to build up to 125,000 units.

Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million for a 1,163 square foot three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000. \n \u201cThey\u2019re selling out like crazy,\u201d said Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. \u201cWe had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn\u2019t 100 per cent\u00a0get what we wanted.\u201d \n A spokeswoman for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent\u00a0of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch. \n Canada\u2019s housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent\u00a0to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about $10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent\u00a0in September from last year. \n \n In contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped eight per cent\u00a0in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012. Sales have also declined over the past two years. \n New regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018. Those appear to have been largely absorbed -- aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labor market. That\u2019s put housing affordability front and center in the federal election campaign. \n \u201cI worked 90 hours in one week,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real-estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. \u201cThe pre-sale market is on fire again but resale has picked up too: We\u2019re having the best back-to-back month since 2017.\u201d \n Supply Puzzle \n Canada\u2019s population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto\u2019s booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city\u2019s many universities and colleges. \n Supply is lagging demand with even the International Monetary Fund this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home. \n \u201cThe demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,\u201d said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at Greybrook Capital, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. \u201cWhen you couple those together, that\u2019s an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it\u2019s rental or housing.\u201d \n Election Outcome \n Both the Liberal and Conservative parties are promising to make home buying more affordable on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent\u00a0government-equity stake to almost C$800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals. \n Though the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the RE/MAX broker, said. \n \u201cNo one really knows what to expect: Who\u2019s going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules? Because they really need to revisit that stress test -- it\u2019s causing people a lot of stress,\u201d Borg said. \n Prices in Calgary and Vancouver are still below recent records, down 5.9 per cent\u00a0and 7\u00a0per cent respectively, according to Teranet-National Bank Home Price Indexes. \n Rental Pain \n Lofty home prices have pushed many prospective buyers into the rental market, where vacancy rates are at historically low levels and rents continue to rise. \n \u201cDespite purpose-built apartment construction rising four-fold since 2014, rental supply is unlikely to come close to demand in the coming years,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report last month. \u201cA deliberate policy to boost rental supply is needed\u2014with specific targets and incentives to achieve them.\u201d \n The bank estimates that the number of renter households will jump by an average of 22,200 per year in Toronto. To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year. \n The federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what\u2019s needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said. \n --With assistance from Erik Hertzberg. \u00a0 \n"}, {"source": "Bloomberg News", "author": "Shelly Hagan and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "From childcare to transit, Canadian voters are feeling pinched", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/from-childcare-to-transit-canadian-voters-are-feeling-pinched-1.1326491", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Oct 4, 2019", "content": "Canada\u2019s political party leaders are making affordability the central talking point of their election campaigns, rolling out targeted measures to alleviate the financial strain besetting voters. \n Though broad economic data show the nation\u2019s economy is humming along, Canadians are still feeling tight on cash. The worsening global outlook and unprecedented policy uncertainty are adding to the apprehension. \n Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, along with the leaders of smaller parties are seeking to parlay that stress into votes as the clock winds down on the Oct. 21 election, by promising a slew of tax cuts and other measures to make life more affordable for Canadians. \n \u201cPoliticians are putting their finger on something, some form of financial anxiety about rising costs, or concerns about future rising costs, or future standard of living,\u201d said Jennifer Robson, associate professor of political management at Carleton University in Ottawa. \n Here\u2019s why consumers are feeling pinched. \n \n It\u2019s old news that owning a home in Canada\u2019s biggest cities has become an almost impossible goal for much of the middle class. Skyrocketing prices in recent years pushed potential buyers to the sidelines. New mortgage lending rules, so-called stress tests introduced by federal regulators in 2017, put ownership even further out of reach for many. \n Toronto and Vancouver are easily Canada\u2019s two main cities where residents are struggling to find an affordable place to live. The average selling price for a single family home in Vancouver was $1.51 million in September, and $1.1 million in Toronto. Renting in those cities is no easy feat either as low vacancy rates have pushed up prices for accommodation. \n \n Elevated real estate prices are the main driver of the country\u2019s record household debt ratios, now the highest in the Group of Seven. Buyers took out larger and larger mortgages as the housing market heated up, even as incomes failed to keep pace. As a result, household savings rates are hovering near the lowest in decades and the debt service ratio -- which measures the share of disposable income paid toward principal and interest -- climbed to a record in the second quarter. \n \n While overall price inflation in Canada has been relatively benign, shoppers have experienced sticker shock on many basics. Prices for fruits and vegetables jumped as much as 60 per cent in the past decade, according to Statistics Canada. Childcare and tuition costs rose upwards of 35 per cent and public transit prices ballooned by 50 per cent. \n \n To top it all off, wages after accounting for inflation have remained relatively flat, even as costs for rent and basic goods increased. A puzzle for many economists and policy makers is why unemployment is hovering near record lows, yet incomes are struggling to pick up. \n \u2018Arms Race\u2019 \n The financial pressure on Canadians isn\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon, with the worldwide economic outlook dimming. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for\u00a0global growth\u00a0this year to 3.2 per cent. A rate of 3.3 per cent or lower would be the weakest since 2009. Adding to the tension, many workers are worried about robots displacing jobs and the financial impact of an aging population. \n \u201cThat\u2019s the emotional side of this issue that doesn\u2019t show up in any CPI index or economic data,\u201d said David Coletto, chief executive at Abacus Data. \u201cIt\u2019s in the head and the parties are clearly recognizing that emotional side is important. It\u2019s like an arms race right now in Canada to offer up who can save us the most money.\u201d \n"}, {"source": null, "author": "Roula Meditskos, Senior Producer, BNN Bloomberg", "title": "The Daily Chase: Trade tensions mount as U.S. plans EU tariffs; markets rebound", "description": null, "url": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-daily-chase-trade-tensions-mount-as-u-s-plans-eu-tariffs-markets-rebound-1.1325879", "urlToImage": null, "PublishedAt": "Oct 3, 2019", "content": "Swiss cheese, Greek yogurt and Irish whisky are among the items that will become more expensive in the United States on Oct. 18.

But affordability is still top of mind in the lead-up to the Oct. 21 vote, especially in markets like Toronto in Vancouver, where home prices are some of the highest in the country. \n To assess some of the four major parties\u2019 housing promises so far, BNN Bloomberg spoke with John Pasalis, the president of Toronto-based real estate brokerage Realosophy. \n CONSERVATIVES \n The pledge:  Change the stress test to help first-time homebuyers access mortgages more easily and remove the test completely for mortgage renewals. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cOne of the problems is high debt levels in Canada. If you look at the markets that are the most unaffordable, in particular Toronto, the market doesn\u2019t need much more stimulus right now. It\u2019s already really competitive. So generally, [the stress test is] probably not the best policy to ease [for first-time buyers] right now.\u201d \n \u201cRemoving [the stress test] from renewals is not a bad idea.\u201d \n The pledge:  Increase the amortization period for insured mortgages to 30 years, reversing the previous Conservative government\u2019s move to decrease it from 40 to 25 years. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cIn Toronto, [increasing the amortization period] would certainly add more fuel to the fire because the market\u2019s already very competitive. But in a lot of other cities that are not as unaffordable as Toronto, do you really need that stimulus? Do people need to be going with 30-year amortizations when they\u2019re buying in markets where homes are not eight times their income, like Toronto? So generally, it\u2019s not a good policy because it\u2019s just going to encourage higher levels of household debt. I think it would almost certainly drive house prices higher.\u201d \n The pledge:  Make federal real estate available for housing developments. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cI think in theory that could be a good approach, but I think that\u2019s a long-term plan for housing. These types of policies don\u2019t really help us in the short term; they might help 10 years down the road.\u201d \u00a0 \n LIBERALS \n The pledge:  Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has vowed to expand his newly-implemented First-Time Home Buyer\u00a0Incentive by including homes valued at a maximum of nearly $800,000, up from about $500,000 in Vancouver, Toronto, and Victoria. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cI think this one will probably have less impact on the market than increasing amortizations, which everybody can benefit from. I don\u2019t think as many people will sign up to partner with the government to buy a home as you would have people getting a 30-year mortgage.\u201d \n The pledge:  Implement a national one-per-cent speculation and vacancy tax. \n Pasalis\u2019 take: \u00a0\u201cThis is actually a very good policy because it mirrors what B.C. has done. A lot of people said, \u2018There are no vacant homes, these things aren\u2019t issues.\u2019 Then, when they implemented this tax, we started to see all sorts of luxury properties getting listed for rent for almost nothing, so people could just avoid these taxes. \n \u201cIt\u2019s also great because one of the problems with introducing these types of policies provincially is that when B.C. introduces something, like a foreign buyers\u2019 tax or a speculation tax, it pushes people to Toronto. When Ontario does something, it pushes people to Ottawa or Montreal. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been finding when these policies are introduced provincially. So having something that\u2019s national will help mitigate those types of flows.\u201d \n \n \n \n READ MORE: ELECTION HOUSING PROMISES  \n  Scheer pledges to make mortgages longer, remove stress test for renewals \n Election housing promises: Crunching the numbers \n \n \n  Trudeau promises new speculation tax on foreign buyers if re-elected \n \n \n \n NDP \n The pledge:  The NDP has promised to create 500,000 new affordable housing units over the next decade, if elected. Similar to the Conservatives, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh also says he\u2019d re-introduce 30-year terms for insured mortgages for first-time buyers. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cOf course the idea of building 500 new affordable housing units is great. But is it going to get done and how is the key thing.\u201d \n The pledge:  Implement a 15-per-cent foreign buyers' tax on purchases of residential property. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cI\u2019m mixed on this one. I think the Liberal plan is probably a better one because it curbs bad behaviour of leaving properties empty, and it\u2019s more of an ongoing tax. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to help in the biggest markets \u2013 in Toronto and Vancouver \u2013 because [those places] already have one, unless they are suggesting adding one on top of that, which will make it 30 per cent. It\u2019s decent policy, but it may be too much to have nationally.\u201d \n The pledge:  Remove GST and HST on the construction of new rental units, and give up to $5,000 in rental subsidies to help 500,000 households pay for housing. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cI think any policies that reduce frictions to build rentals are good.\u201d \n The pledge:  Dedicate a unit of the RCMP to fight money laundering, and create a national registry to prevent companies from hiding who profits from real estate. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cThe Conservatives said they\u2019re going to plan and do research into [money laundering] whereas at least the NDP announced that they want to track beneficial ownership of properties. So it seems like they\u2019re actually trying to push policies that curb it, rather than doing what the Conservatives say they are going to do, which is \u2018We\u2019re just going to study for the next four years.\u2019\u201d \n GREENS \n The pledge:  Scrap the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cI think it might just save us some money because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be a very popular policy \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if throwing government money into buying homes is a good policy. I would say it would be better to scrap it and invest [the money] into rentals, for example.\u201d \n The pledge:  Restore tax incentives for purpose-built rentals. \n Pasalis\u2019 take:  \u201cAny tax incentives that the government can put in place to encourage purpose-built rentals I think is certainly good.\u201d \u00a0 \n The pledge:  Appoint a national housing minister. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a bit surprising that we don\u2019t have one. I think it\u2019s partly because perhaps the [federal government] sees housing as a provincial issue. But it\u2019s all interconnected. You can\u2019t have the federal government deciding [the] rate of immigration without caring at all about how we\u2019re going to house people. And when housing is pretty much the biggest component of our economy \u2026 I think it would make sense to have a national view of housing and housing policy.

quiet, tree-lined street with a good old-fashioned hockey shootout. \n Real estate agent Daniel Weiner said the owner of the semi-detached house and the buyer were just $3,000 apart on price. \n \u201cNo one was budging,\u201d Weiner told BNN Bloomberg in a phone interview. \u201cIt was an old Canadian standoff.\u201d \n With talks near collapsing, homeowner Gavin Wolch said he made a sarcastic comment to Weiner, his agent, about heading to the rink to break the impasse. \n \u201cI was surprised when [the bidder] came back and said, \u2018Game on,\u2019\u201d Wolch said in an email. \u201cIt took on a life of its own.\u201d \n The buyer, who asked not to be identified, used to play in the National Hockey League. But Wolch, himself a goalie in a men\u2019s recreational league, said he wasn\u2019t intimidated by his opponent\u2019s NHL career. \n \u201cHe is a fierce competitor and a great sport,\u201d Wolch said. \u201cThe guy could pick up a truck one-handed.\u201d \n With an audience of roughly 30 family and friends, Wolch and the bidder hit the ice at a local recreational centre for a best-of-eleven competition. \n \n The basement of the Calgary home. (Screen grab/Calgary Real Estate Board)\u00a0 \n \n Wolch ended up besting the former NHL player with six saves to four goals. \n The shootout loser \u2013 or buyer of the home \u2013 then had to raise the agreed purchase price by $1,500. The home was originally listed for $689,000, and sold for $661,500, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board. \n \u201cIt\u2019s very unique,\u201d said Weiner. \u201cAnd something I\u2019ve never been a part of.\u201d \n Home sales and price growth have declined in Calgary over the past two years, according to the city\u2019s real estate board. \n In a forecast released this summer, the board noted a recent drop in supply may help balance the real estate market, but added prices are expected to stay below last year\u2019s depressed levels. \n Against that backdrop, Weiner says it\u2019s important for Calgarians to have a sense of humour. \n \u201cWe have to be creative to keep our deals together in a challenging market,\u201d he said. \n Weiner and the buyer\u2019s agents also managed to get in on the action: the realtor representing the shootout loser had to pay the $260 ice rental fee. \n"}]
