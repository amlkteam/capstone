"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Ben Steverman,Baby boomers are thriving on an 'unprecedented' $9-trillion inheritance,Inheritances are part of a dynamic that's widening the wealth gap between generations,https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/baby-boomers-are-thriving-on-an-unprecedented-9-trillion-inheritance,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/inheritance.jpg,"November 19, 2019 10:42 AM EST","The rich aren’t just getting richer. They’re getting older. And, fortunately for their children, they’re set to leave plenty of money in the bank.About US$36 trillion will flow from one generation to another over the next 30 years, according to a report Tuesday from wealth manager United Income. The pace of bequests has already started surging. Americans inherited US$427 billion in 2016, the most recent data available, up 119 per cent from 1989 even after adjusting for inflation.“Wealth equal to nearly two times the size of the U.S. GDP is expected to be gifted to charities and heirs over the next few decades,” said United Income founder Matt Fellowes. “It’s a historically unprecedented amount that is almost incomprehensibly large.”

Generation X is ‘stretched beyond their financial limits’ and struggling to save for retirement
The beneficiaries aren’t all that young themselves. The study, which uses Federal Reserve and academic data, shows that from 1989 to 2016 U.S. households inherited more than US$8.5 trillion. Over that time, the average age of recipients rose by a decade to 51. More than a quarter of bequests now go to adults 61 or older.“Instead of diapers and school, inheritances are increasingly going toward medical bills and retirement savings,” Fellowes said.Even inheritances, then, are part of a dynamic that’s widening the wealth gap between generations. Americans younger than 50 held just 16 per cent of all investable assets in 2016, down from 31 per cent in 1989, according to the Fed’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, leaving the rest to households 50 and older.Instead of diapers and school, inheritances are increasingly going toward medical bills and retirement savings 
 
Age inequality is most dramatic when comparing the oldest and youngest adults. In 1989, the median household age 65 to 75 held almost eight times more wealth than families headed by 25- to 35-year-olds. By 2016, according to an analysis by the St. Louis Fed, the median baby boomer had close to 13 times more wealth than the typical millennial.While boomers as a group inherited trillions from their parents, most members of the postwar generation got nothing. About 20 per cent of households have received inheritances, United Income’s analysis shows, a share that’s flat over the past 30 years.The good news is that these bequests are coming in handy. The median recipient gets about US$55,000, which is more than double their typical retirement savings.

“Most inheritances are going to older adults who have little in the way of retirement savings,” said Fellowes, a former Brookings Institution scholar. “People receiving inheritances are pretty middle class.”United Income, an online retirement planning firm, was founded in 2016 and acquired in July by Capital One Financial Corp.As more Americans live longer without the safety net of a traditional pension, the data suggest they’re spending frugally to make sure their wealth lasts. The result is more Americans dying before they can spend all of their savings. Financial advisers say they often need to encourage affluent clients to enjoy their wealth rather than hoarding it.Only about 9 per cent of estates consist entirely of a house or other property, United Income’s analysis shows. The average estate is 46 per cent stocks, bonds, cash and other liquid investments — giving an immediate boost to recipients’ own retirement planning at a key time.The money left behind for middle-class Americans is dwarfed by that inherited by the children of the very wealthy. United Income’s estimates don’t include gifts made during donors’ lifetimes — a typical move in estate planning for the ultra-high net worth cohort, often using trusts. It still found a widening gulf between the super rich and everyone else.The median inheritance has risen only about US$15,000 in three decades, while they’ve more than doubled for the 0.3 per cent of Americans receiving at least US$1 million. In 1989, their inheritances averaged an inflation-adjusted US$2.7 million. By 2016, they were each getting an average of US$6.6 million.Bloomberg.com",,1,US-related,1,inherited assets adding to GDP,,,,

Economists had forecast employers would add 6,000 jobs.Statistically, the decline is considered a flat reading. The country’s jobless rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent.It was only a matter of time before Canada’s jobs market cooled after a sharp rise in employment in recent months, particularly as other indicators have showed a much weaker picture.

Canada’s economy had added 290,000 jobs between August and February, the largest six-month increase since 2002. Those gains however were out of line with other indicators that showed production stalling at the end of last year, in part because of falling oil prices.The strong performance of the jobs market up to now has been one of the reasons why the Bank of Canada has stuck to its belief the economy will rebound later this year.Labour force numbers, which had been rising strongly along with jobs, also declined slightly in March, down by 11,300.The employment decrease in March was driven by a 17,300 drop in private-sector jobs, with public sector employment up slightly last month. Health-care and accommodation led the job losses. Among provinces, Quebec and Ontario saw the largest declines, with combined losses of 21,700.The labour market continues to improve in one respect: annual hourly wage gains accelerated to 2.4 per cent in March,the fastest annual gain since September, up from 2.3 per cent in February.Pay gains for permanent employees rose to 2.3 per cent, the strongest increase since August.Total hours worked also picked up in March, increasing by 0.9 per cent annually, after a drop of 0.1 per cent the previous month.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

Two of GM Canada’s plants — Oshawa and St. Catharines — rely on parts from the U.S. and could see jobs being hit as early as this week, said Jerry Dias, national president for Unifor, the Canadian union.“There will be temporary layoffs in all three facilities as the parts start to dry up,” Dias said in a phone interview. “It could hit about a couple of thousand jobs.”

Jennifer Wright, a spokeswoman for GM Canada, said there’s been no impact on Canadian operations, but the company is monitoring the situation closely. GM Canada has about 5,700 hourly employees at three manufacturing plants in Ontario.About 2,200 workers at GM’s Oshawa assembly plant build the Chevrolet Impala and models of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. At the St. Catharines engine and transmission operations, about 1,100 employees make V6 and V8 engines and GF6 transmissions. Those engines are shipped to about 10 different GM assembly plants across North America. The CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll builds the Chevrolet Equinox with about 2,400 employees.Parts MakersThe UAW is fighting over jobs and benefits, including better health care and the length of time it takes for shorter-tenured members to get top-scale pay. The strike could cost GM about US$50 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes due to lost production, Dan Levy, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Sunday. Shares in the Detroit-based company fell about 3 per cent on Monday.“GM workers in the U.S. are mad as hell, just like GM workers in Canada,” Dias said. “For way too long we’ve been losing our jobs to Mexico where GM candidly exploits their employees. There’s frustration with GM on both sides of the border.”GM workers in the U.S. are mad as hell, just like GM workers in CanadaJerry Dias 
 
Magna along with Linamar Corp. and Martinrea International Inc. are among the largest suppliers to the North American auto industry. Magna gets about 15 per cent of its revenue from GM, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and is hoping that both sides will get back to the negotiating table.High Stakes“We remain hopeful for a quick resolution,” Scott Worden, a spokesman for Aurora, Ontario-based Magna, said in an emailed statement. “Although Magna supplies GM on a number of programs globally, it would be premature to comment on the potential impact to our operations right now.”Rob Wildeboer, co-founder and chairman of Vaughan, Ontario-based Martinrea, said in an email that any production affected would likely be made up later and Flavio Volpe, president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, is optimistic a resolution will come soon.“One day, two days, you can readjust your production schedules, you can bounce around your operations; three days, four days, it starts affecting people’s shifts,” Volpe said. “This is why we’ll probably see a resolution today. On both sides there is just way too much at stake to carry into day two.”Linamar didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Magna shares were little changed in Toronto trade while Linamar and Martinrea rose.If the strike lasts to the end of the month it would take only 0.1 per cent off annualized U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, according to economists at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Sales would continue from existing dealer and wholesale inventories.“Impacts on Canada would be even more modest,” Avery Shenfeld at the Toronto-based bank said in a note. “In the unlikely case where the strike lasts through the fourth quarter in its entirety, it would subtract a more meaningful 0.7 per cent off that quarter’s annualized pace in the U.S., and take a bit of a shine off Canada as well.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

The chance of a recession happening over the next 12 months is 25 per cent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday in Mississippi that “we don’t feel the probability of recession is at all elevated.”The ongoing debate makes it all the more important to focus on how the markets are interrelated, said Jeffrey Sherman, DoubleLine Capital LP’s deputy chief investment officer. Rates are higher compared with recent history, we’ve seen margins compress a bit, and it’s possible GDP growth slows down to trend — closer to two per cent, he said. When it comes to investing, everyone needs some stocks in their portfolios, they just have to be “more cautious,” Sherman said during the panel discussion.“You have peak earnings and peak euphoria,” Sherman said. “The question becomes, how does corporate America respond at this stage? It doesn’t look horrible.”Shiller and DoubleLine have a long relationship. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund puts the majority of its investments into a fixed-income portfolio, while at the same time employing derivatives to gain exposure to large-cap equities that are undervalued based on an index created by Shiller. Launched in 2013, the fund’s five-year track record puts the product in the 99th percentile when compared with peers, according to a Bloomberg ranking.The cyclically adjusted P-E ratio (CAPE), which Shiller developed 30 years ago, uses 10 years of earnings in its calculations to gauge stock market valuations. Right now the measure comes in around 30, which is “quite high” according to Shiller, especially considering that’s about double the historical average. Going forward, though, the ratio should come down just because of time — the worst earnings during the financial crisis should fall out of the equation soon.“That doesn’t mean you expect negative returns,” Shiller said.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,citing famous economist to cool econ optimism,,,,

That has kept the Bank of Canada as an outlier in the global easing trend as it held its policy rate unchanged, bolstering the allure of the loonie.“These high levels of immigration — if they are to continue and help support growth — are actually supportive of a Canadian dollar over time,” Frances Donald, chief economist at Manulife Investment Management, said in an interview in Toronto.

The country’s population grew by 208,234 in the July to September period, or 0.6 per cent, the fastest quarterly increase since at least 1971. Some 83 per cent of that increase is due to international migration, according to estimates from Statistics Canada released Thursday in Ottawa. Over the past year, Canada’s population has jumped by almost 560,000, an increase of 1.5 per cent — that’s the fastest annual pace since 1990.“This is the story I think markets are missing: how powerful immigration is at actually changing your financial markets, particularly your rates and FX,” Donald said.The Canadian dollar is on pace to take the No. 1 spot among its Group-of-10 counterparts this year, strengthening by about 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar.Canada’s population boom has driven robust gains in the housing and labour markets, countering the effect of an aging demographic.

“What’s fascinating about the story however, from a strategist, like myself, is not even how it relates to GDP growth but how we’re substituting one form of policy for another,” Donald said.While Donald argues immigration can be a proxy for monetary policy, currency strategists say the central bank is still the main driver of the loonie, and immigration is more of a long-term variable that can influence policy.“Immigration informs the output gap and hence policy stance,” wrote Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. “FX will react to how the Bank changes policy.”Case in point, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has cited the country’s robust labour force, supported by new entrants, as a reason for holding interest rates despite concerns around a slowdown.Relying on human capital to improve growth and inflation numbers over time actually acts as a curve steepener, Donald added. “If we rely on this so called human stimulus then we don’t have to rely on monetary policy to the same extent.”Bloomberg.com",,1,,1,,,,,

The gains were broad-based outside of the energy sector, and included the biggest one-month increase in construction activity in more than five years. Manufacturing output also surged.The numbers paint a much less bleak picture for an economy that came to a near halt at the end of last year, with January GDP now putting growth on pace for a stronger first quarter than most economists are anticipating. The gains should also bolster confidence among officials at the Bank of Canada that growth will bounce back.“Overall, a better than expected start to Q1 after a near zero growth rate in Q4, and reason enough for the Bank of Canada to hang on to its hopes that the growth stall late last year will prove temporary,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.Financial markets are betting the central bank is likely to cut interest rates because of the weak run of data until now. Canada’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter, including contractions of 0.1 per cent in each of the final two months of 2018. Economists had been forecasting equally sluggish growth this quarter.The Canadian dollar jumped on the report, gaining 0.6 per cent to 74.87 US cents at 8:39 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on Canadian two-year bonds rose 5 basis points to 1.54 per cent.The gains would have even been larger had the Alberta government not imposed mandatory oil production cuts in January to ease pipeline bottlenecks that have depressed prices for heavy Canadian crude. Oilsands extraction was down 4.1 per cent in January.Statistics Canada saw 18 of 20 industrial sectors posting increases in January.

Goods-producing industries recorded a 0.6 per cent gain in January, the biggest one-month increase since February 2018. Services were up 0.2 per cent, driven by wholesale sales Construction advanced 1.9 per cent, the first gain in eight months and the largest advance since July 2013. That includes a 3.1 per cent increase in residential building Output by manufacturers rose 1.5 per cent, the biggest increase since November 2017 and more than offsetting two straight monthly declines The real estate agent and broker subcategory increased 4.1 per cent after four months of declines.

While the research surrounding Canada’s reviews has been serious, the end result each time has only been minor changes.

William Watson: Without going full Trump, maybe we could (slightly) politicize interest rates
The biggest tweak, made in 2011, gave the Bank of Canada more time to reach its target. The underlying objective — to focus exclusively on price stability and use 2 per cent inflation as an operational guide — has been largely untouched.So why hasn’t the case for change been more compelling?Officials at the Bank of Canada, whose next mandate renewal takes place in 2021, boil it down to a few things:– The system is not perfect, but the framework has been largely successful even with the recent difficulties in hitting the target. Price pressures and inflation expectations are stable, and economic cycles over the past two decades have been less volatile than has been historically the case.

– One of the biggest benefits of inflation targeting is it’s much easier to communicate, and for people to understand, than more complex approaches.– Perhaps more importantly is an acknowledgment that there is a false precision to the whole business of inflation targeting. Economics isn’t an exact-enough science to really allow them to get it perfectly, which is why Canadian policy makers are happy to allow inflation to move within a range — 1 per cent to 3 per cent — and would become worried only if they see a real risk of the band being breached. The 2 per cent “target” is simply the midpoint.“For now what we’ve got is the inflation target and it’s done a good job for us,” is how Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz recently put it.On the idea of average inflation targeting being touted widely, for example, Poloz says it makes a lot of sense theoretically “but in practice, I’d need to be persuaded myself.”“The ability to let it cruise above 2 and know exactly when to prevent it from continuing on towards 3 is a lot harder than rocket science,” said Poloz. It’s “really hard to pull off and risky on the upside.”That doesn’t mean things won’t change. Poloz and his main deputy overseeing the review, Carolyn Wilkins, seem to be open to new ideas, particularly given how monetary policy is becoming increasingly constrained by low interest rates and inflation. That’s a world where the central bank has limited firepower to fight a recession, even as cheap money threatens to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis.As a result, the latest review underway at the Bank of Canada seems to be the most ambitious yet. Alternatives under consideration include raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate, targeting nominal GDP and even average inflation targeting.Yet, Canadian monetary policymakers are also quick to point out that there are limits to what central banks can do to solve all the economy’s ills. Government policy too, they point out, has an important role, particularly in tackling structural issues.Bloomberg.com",,0,,0,,,,,

France’s drug safety regulator, the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament, said in a statement dated Wednesday that it ordered a recall of all brand-name and generic Zantac available in pharmacies.European and U.S. health officials said earlier this month they are looking into how the drugs came to be contaminated. Zantac and its generic equivalents are used by millions of people, including pregnant women and infants, to treat gastrointestinal disorders and discomfort. Recalls or distribution halts have also been announced by multiple manufacturers.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating the carcinogen levels and hasn’t required any recalls or distribution halts. Canadian health officials required drugmakers last week to halt distribution of all versions of Zantac.California Representative Anna Eshoo, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s health panel, wrote the FDA last week with concerns about its efforts on Zantac, known in its generic form as ranitidine.“The United States has moved slowly to address this cancer risk,” Eshoo wrote Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the letter reviewed by Bloomberg.At Eshoo’s urging, she and Woodcock are set to talk Monday about the FDA’s response, according to the congresswoman’s office.“FDA is continuing to test ranitidine products from multiple manufacturers and assess the possible effect on patients who have been taking ranitidine,” the agency said in the statement Thursday.Novartis AG’s Sandoz unit recalled its generic prescription Zantac in the U.S. earlier this week after detecting elevated levels of the carcinogen NDMA. The carcinogen is the same one that last year sparked a recall in about 30 countries of millions of blood-pressure pills called angiotensin II receptor blockers. Sandoz has also halted worldwide distribution of its generic Zantac.The FDA asked all makers of brand-name and generic Zantac to test their own products for NDMA.GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the original branded maker of Zantac, halted global distribution of the drug Wednesday and recalled its pills in India and Hong Kong. The recalled medicine is made with an active ingredient from two India-based suppliers, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. and Saraca Laboratories Ltd., Kristen Neese, a spokeswoman for Glaxo, said in an email Wednesday. Some European regulators have initiated recalls of ranitidine made with active ingredient from Saraca as well.Dr. Reddy’s, one of India’s largest generic drugmakers, is cleared to sell its own finished versions of prescription and over-the-counter generic Zantac in the U.S. It hasn’t recalled any product, but last week it suspended all its shipments of the drug.A recall means drugs must come off of pharmacy shelves, while a distribution halt means the company is no longer supplying the drugs, though typically those already on shelves can be sold.Glaxo doesn’t supply or manufacture ranitidine products in the U.S. or Canada, said Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the company. The company does supply ranitidine products in multiple markets in Europe that are made at sites in Italy and Spain, and via third-party manufacturers in Germany, according to Quinn.Bloomberg.com",,0,,0,,,,,

The full text of the letter as it appears on Apple’s website is below:To Apple investors:Today we are revising our guidance for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:Revenue of approximately US$84 billion Gross margin of approximately 38 per cent Operating expenses of approximately US$8.7 billion Other income/(expense) of approximately US$550 million Tax rate of approximately 16.5 per cent before discrete items. 
Apple’s warning says a lot about the global economy — and it’s not good
Apple bombshell sends global investors to safe havens while ‘flash crash’ jolts currencies
Apple now says Q1 revenue drop will be up to 10% on weak holiday, China sales
We expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.Based on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance.While it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates.When we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:First, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4’18–placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1’18, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1’19, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.Second, we knew the strong U.S. dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.Third, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. Again, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.Fourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected.In addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated.These last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I’d like to go a bit deeper on both.Emerging Market ChallengesWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.China’s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China’s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.Despite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.iPhoneLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.While Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.Many Positive Results in the December QuarterWhile it’s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges.Our installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high–growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it’s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers.Also, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales.Services generated over US$10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.Wearables grew by almost 50 per cent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth.We also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.Finally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple’s earnings per share.Looking AheadOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately US$130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.As we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result.Most importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.We can’t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base.This is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple’s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.Expectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.That has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.TimBloomberg.com",,-1,US-specific,-1,greater weakness in emerging economies seen esp.

Friday’s retail report is the last bit of economic data for the second quarter, with GDP numbers due Aug. 30. The retail numbers are likely to reinforce expectations that second quarter GDP growth was near 3 per cent on an annualized basis, probably enough to keep the central bank on the sidelines for now.“The decent finish to the quarter gives some momentum for Q3, a reason why we see the Bank of Canada delaying a rate cut for several more months,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said in a note to investors.Even with the flat June results, Canada’s retail sector was able to eke out half decent gains in the second quarter with sales up 1.2 per cent in nominal terms and volumes up 0.1 per cent.Canadian retailers have been in a bit of a slump for more than a year.

The rebound follows two straight quarters of hardly any growth. The period also ended better than expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.2 per cent in June.The underlying details, however, were less impressive. The rebound was driven by the fastest quarterly increase in exports since 2014, but growth in household consumption came to a near halt despite strong gains in incomes, and business investment shrank by the most in more than two years. As a result, domestic demand contracted in the second quarter.

That could be a signal of growing unease among households and businesses about global economic conditions, fuelled by concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and potentially foreshadowing a sharper slowdown in the second half of the year. Policy makers at the Bank of Canada may look through some of the strength in the report.“This was a ‘less than meets the eye’ report,” Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note to investors. “Not only were today’s details weak, but since the second quarter ended we’ve seen yet another escalation in the trade wars and associated uncertainty.”This was a 'less than meets the eye' report Brian DePratto, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank 
 
Possibly reflecting concerns about the outlook, businesses met some of the pickup in foreign demand by drawing down inventories, rather than boosting production. The strong gain in exports, meanwhile, is seen as only temporary, reflecting a ramping up of shipments after a sluggish winter. Exports had slumped sharply earlier this year because of curtailments on oil production and other temporary issues, prompting many businesses to stockpile.DePratto said he expects the Bank of Canada to join the global trend toward easing monetary policy in October, an increasingly likely scenario according to swaps trading. A second cut is being priced in by investors sometime next year. The next rate decision is Sept. 4, when policy makers aren’t expected to move but will likely strike a more dovish tone. Friday’s GDP numbers beat the bank’s 2.3 per cent forecast, and economists had predicted a 3 per cent increase.The stronger-than-expected headline figure boosted the Canadian dollar. The loonie was up 0.2 per cent to $1.3255 per U.S. dollar at 10:04 a.m. in Toronto.‘Solid Increase’Despite the worrying details, the Canadian economic expansion in the second quarter was still impressive — growing the most in two years at easily the fastest pace in the Group of Seven. The U.S. economy expanded by an annualized 2 per cent over the same period.Shipments by Canadian exporters rose at a 13 per cent pace, contributing more than 4 percentage points to growth. A drop in imports also added to the expansion, as more of the nation’s demand was used to buy domestically produced goods and services.Housing investment, meanwhile, recorded its first gain in six quarters.It’s the sort of data that make the case for cheaper money less compelling in Canada than it is elsewhere. Even two cuts over the next 12 months will still leave the country with the highest policy rate among advanced economies.“The solid increase in the headline numbers leaves our call intact for the Bank of Canada to remain patient on cutting rates for the next few month,” said Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which expects a cut in January.Bloomberg.com

There are about 20 more countries interested in support, Georgieva said.The fund also has about US$400 million in its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to help poor countries with debt relief. With the help of donations, like US$195 million recently from the U.K., the IMF hopes to boost that to US$1 billion, she said.“As the virus spreads, the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour,” Georgieva said. “During the global financial crisis, for example, fiscal stimulus by the G-20 amounted to about 2 per cent of GDP, or over US$900 billion in today’s money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.”Georgieva added that the IMF “stands ready to mobilize its US$1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership.” She praised the swap lines announced by central banks on Sunday, saying that going forward there may be a need for swap lines to emerging-market economies.The comments come after Georgieva said earlier this month that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” and that it’s still difficult to predict the economic impact of the virus. Meanwhile, the fund on Friday ordered all staff at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee was diagnosed with the virus. Bloomberg.com",,-1,current econ is bad so need global stimulus,-1,,,,,

Economic growth figures for Canada are due Friday.President Donald Trump’s twitter tirade upended markets globally Friday with the S&P/TSX Composite Index down 1.3 per cent, for a second weekly decline. The slide in Canadian stocks wasn’t as painful as the plunge in their U.S. counterparts — the Nasdaq was down 3 per cent — thanks to the heavy weighting of gold miners in Canada. The S&P/TSX Materials Index — which has an 11.9 per cent weighting on the TSX — was the only winner with an 1.8 per cent climb.Now on to earnings.It looks like money manager Steve Eisman’s short bets on Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce haven’t panned out. At least not yet. Shares of both banks climbed after reporting earnings last week.RBC’s domestic personal-and-commercial banking unit — the company’s biggest division — posted a 7.9 per cent jump in earnings to a record $1.61 billion. Wealth-management profits rose 11 per cent. CIBC reported that its U.S. operations and higher revenue lifted profits.Still, it’s worth noting that RBC fell for a fifth consecutive week, its longest losing streak since 2016. The stock has slumped about 10 per cent since its April peak.In Eisman’s interview with BNN Bloomberg Thursday — where he disclosed a short position in retailer Canadian Tire Corp. — he reiterated his short bets on both banks, as well as Laurentian Bank of Canada and alternative lender Home Capital Group Inc.. He said the timeframe for his bet is nine months to three years.Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia are slated to report on Aug. 27, National Bank of Canada the following day and Toronto-Dominion Bank closes out the season on Aug. 29. Smaller, niche lenders Canadian Western Bank and Laurentian Bank also report that day.Rewarding shareholders might help. Barclays Plc analyst John Aiken, who called the dividend hike for CIBC, also expects Scotiabank and Canadian Western Bank to follow suit. “Dividend yields remain strong, providing some downside protection and supporting the ‘defensive flight to safety’ trade,” he said in an Aug. 12 report.Second-quarter GDP data will be the main event for economy watchers. With July’s inflation holding steady at 2 per cent, tempering the case for a rate cut, market participants will be on edge to see if there’s a hint of a slowdown, which could boost the possibility of an October rate cut. The forecast for June is 0.1 per cent growth, down from 0.2 per cent in May.Here’s our weekly wrap of what happened in CanadaMarkets — just the numbersWhat started off as a quiet week on the trade front quickly escalated on Friday as China said it plans to slap tariffs on US$75 billion of U.S. goods in December. Then came Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole which attempted to reassure markets. But that was a distant memory within minutes as Trump unleashed a Twitter diatribe against his appointed Fed chair.The U.S. 10-year yield slid and stocks tumbled.CEO wealthThis year has been one for the record books when it comes to Canadian airline stocks. And it just got better with Amazon.com Inc. and Cargojet Inc.’s announcement Friday that the e-commerce giant plans to take an ownership position in the Canadian cargo carrier via two tranches of warrants issuance.The stock rallied 13 per cent to close at a record high. Fun fact: Cargojet’s Chief Executive Officer and founder Ajay Virmani gained almost $18 million on paper for the day.Another Canadian CEO got a nice bump Friday. Entertainment One Ltd.’s Darren Throop saw his stake in the company jump by 10 million pounds (US$12.3 million) as the stock soared after Hasbro Inc. agreed to spend US$4 billion to buy the company.

Under the Liberal plan, Canada’s deficit would peak at $27.4 billion next year, bringing it above 1 per cent of GDP for the first time since 2012, before dropping to $21 billion by 2023. That far exceeds the C$14 billion deficit recorded in 2018. In total, the plan would add an additional $31.5 billion in deficits and bring the cumulative budget gap over the next four years to $93 billion.

Conservatives court small business, pledging to end red tape ‘rat’s nest’
Politically, the Liberals hope the higher deficits will give them a potential wedge issue in a campaign where the two major parties have rolled out similar policy objectives -– from tax cuts to helping first time home buyers and seniors. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has yet to release his full fiscal projection but has promised to eventually return the budget to balance, though only over five years.In fact, given Scheer’s reluctance for a quick return to balance, both the Liberal and Conservative plans are poised to deliver a boost to the economy next year, no matter who wins. It’s perhaps even enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider cutting interest rates, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.“It seems clear whoever is in power, you are looking at a bigger deficit than had there not been an election,” Perrault said in a telephone interview.Opinion polls show the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives, despite Trudeau’s campaign being jolted by revelations he wore black and brownface makeup numerous times as a younger man. Seat projections tabulated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show neither party holding enough support to win a majority.Deficits matter in Canada, with a collective aversion to debt that was cemented in the mid-1990s amid ratings agency downgrades, a falling currency and a national unity crisis. It remains an explosive issue, even though Trudeau’s deficits have hovered at less than 1 per cent of GDP, far below many other western nations. The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada’s budget would be back in balance.Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he’s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.“I will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity — if they really think so — are going to help Canadians,” Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.Trudeau’s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation’s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory — but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That’s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years’ time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada’s AAA credit rating.There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional C$2 billion as early as next year by undertaking “a new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.”They also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion. It would take effect April 1 and be expected to raise more than $500 million next year. The Liberals also plan to impose a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars and boats worth more than $100,000.Bloomberg.com",,1,govt spending will boost employment; did not say current econ,-1,spending too much in good times,,,,

The 10-year yield fell five basis points to 1.51 per cent, the lowest in two years. An inverted yield curve, in which short-term rates are higher than longer-term yields, is considered by some economists a signal that a recession is looming.Investors are buying long-term bonds after President Trump announced Thursday evening a plan to impose a 5 per cent tariff on imports from Mexico to force the Latin American nation to bolster efforts to stop illegal immigration. The move came just hours after Vice President Mike Pence promised to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement this year, in a meeting in Ottawa with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The “new threats of U.S. tariffs on Mexico – even as passage of the new USMCA seemed to be getting closer — is a reminder that no trade agreement or past indications of goodwill is really full protection against a re-emergence of tensions with the U.S. under the Trump administration, ” said Nathan Janzen, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, in a research note. “That uncertainty will remain a headwind for business investment spending in particular.”The increased trade tensions threaten a Canadian economy that is showing signs of emerging from its first-quarter slump. The economy grew by 0.5 per cent in March, topping estimates, after an expansion of just 0.4 per cent for the first three months of the year, Statistics Canada reported Friday.“The current economic backdrop still looks okay, and better than quarterly GDP growth headlines in the last couple of quarters would imply,” said Janzen. “There is still plenty of uncertainty about the outlook to keep the BoC on the sidelines in terms of any future interest rate hikes for now.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,derail NAFTA,-1,,,,,

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It’s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.“It is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,” Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. “On the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.”

The remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada’s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation’s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy’s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.“We are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,” said Poloz. “In this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.”Outside of trade, Poloz said the country’s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation’s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation’s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn’t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

In the meantime, investors are assessing government rescue plans, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s $82 billion (US$56.7 billion) package rolled out Wednesday that’s worth 3 per cent of GDP.Here are some of their views:Key SupportPhilip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, which manages $879 billion (US$677 billion) of assets:The S&P/TSX Composite Index has slumped to levels not seen since 2016, when the price of oil bottomed out. The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.“The 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.”“In 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.”“I am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office. The only challenge sometimes is finding a quiet place to work or take a call, as my wife and kids are home too. It’s cozy to say the least.”Liquid ETFsDavid Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.:“When I am talking to the traders, I’m focused on ETFs, it’s because that’s where the volume is and that’s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it’s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that’s what I have been recommending people invest.” He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs.He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said. If the slide falls below the 2016 level, “it’ll mean that defaults are accelerating in this country. And to me, that’s the scary part,” he said.Hunting YieldGreg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments:“We are going to be in a period of prolonged low interest rates and people still need income. Whether that income is going to come from dividend equities or alternative sources, I think that’s going to be apparent,” Taylor said in a phone interview from his home. “Companies that have good dividend payouts, that look pretty stable right now, I think those are going to be areas that could be really attractive investments for the next little while.”“We’ve been telling people, those who’ve got some extra cash on the sidelines, it’s probably not a bad time to start putting some of it to work.”Too Late to SellBruce Murray, chief executive officer at The Murray Wealth Group:Murray Wealth is “hunkering down” and “using the opportunity to upgrade our portfolio.” It’s “too late to sell” and the market turning is more of a medical question to do with the spread of the virus, he said.“Most of the downside is behind us,” he said — be there still may be more.Bloomberg.com",,0,stock-market-related,0,,,,,

Canada’s economy practically grinds to a halt — and nobody saw it coming
The country’s currency fell sharply once traders got wind of the numbers, reversing an earlier gain and depreciating as much as 0.5 per cent to 75.52 US cents.Brian DePratto was among the first to notice the agency’s error. “I have an RSS Reader product that I use for work, and my usual process when I come in is to fire up the reader and get a sense of the newsflow,” the senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank said by phone. “And then I opened up the page and saw the Statscan feed had a bunch of new items on it, including those numbers. I was like, ‘oh — that looks like the GDP data,’ and I clicked through and there was a 404,” he said, referring to an Internet message indicating a webpage server issue.Statistic Canada isn’t a stranger to controversy. The agency for years earned the ire of economists by releasing jobs and inflation data earlier than other data, a practice it ended in 2011. Around the same time, it admitted to allowing some distributors to get information almost a minute ahead of the official release, a practice that led to an investigation by KPMG LLP.It later emerged that Statistics Canada released economic reports a day before publication to at least 69 government workers and political aides, a practice that led to a review by lawmakers amid concern it was undermining investor confidence, given the risk the data could be leaked to financial markets.Porter says, though, he hasn’t had big concerns lately about Statistics Canada and that the GDP data should have been handled more carefully. “It did move the markets — so this was an important piece of news and one that shouldn’t have been released early,” he said.With assistance from Doug AlexanderBloomberg.com",,0,,0,,,,,

In fact, given Scheer’s reluctance for a quick return to balance, both the Liberal and Conservative plans are poised to deliver a boost to the economy next year, no matter who wins. It’s perhaps even enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider cutting interest rates, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
“It seems clear whoever is in power, you are looking at a bigger deficit than had there not been an election,” Perrault said in a telephone interview.
Opinion polls show the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives, despite Trudeau’s campaign being jolted by revelations he wore black and brownface makeup numerous times as a younger man. Seat projections tabulated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show neither party holding enough support to win a majority.
Deficits matter in Canada, with a collective aversion to debt that was cemented in the mid-1990s amid ratings agency downgrades, a falling currency and a national unity crisis. It remains an explosive issue, even though Trudeau’s deficits have hovered at less than 1 per cent of GDP, far below many other western nations. The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.
In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada’s budget would be back in balance.
Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he’s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.
“I will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity — if they really think so — are going to help Canadians,” Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.
Deficit Track
Trudeau’s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.
The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation’s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory — but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That’s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years’ time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada’s AAA credit rating.
There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.
The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional $2 billion as early as next year by undertaking “a new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.”
They also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion. It would take effect April 1 and be expected to raise more than $500 million next year. The Liberals also plan to impose a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars and boats worth more than $100,000.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada’s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What’s more, its households are among the world’s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.

“I think it is the Great Reckoning,” says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. “We’ve been in a period for so long where it didn’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.”Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. “Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?” asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. “Where exactly do we draw the line?”A ‘Flammable’ MarketThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada’s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there’s not much that can pick up the slack — certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven’t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer — they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.

That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It’s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city’s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up — “Don’t use your house like an ATM” — as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted 
 
Today, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 — a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt — an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country’s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.“You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,” says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. “And this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.”Airbnb Customers VanishIt doesn’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That’s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.

Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada’s Airbnb hosts — who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 — need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.“It’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter’s grandchildren aren’t even going to be able to pay this off,” says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. “What’s the plan after?”Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

Last week he said the city’s retail outlets would be allowed to open May 11; the new date is May 18.Next door in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford indicated he would continue to take a slow approach to restarting Canada’s biggest provincial economy. Ford said the province is getting close to allowing more retail stores to open for curbside pickup — as long as virus cases continue to decline. He didn’t give a date.

Shockproofing Canada: Here’s what it will take to reopen the economy
Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.Hospitals ‘Very Tight’The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsQuebec Premier Francois Legault 
 
Meanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

That followed a 2.2 per cent advance in the prior three months.The numbers may bolster hopes that growth is stabilizing after its recent soft patch. Trump, speaking with reporters before departing on a trip on Air Force One, said the GDP numbers were “far higher than the high expectations.”

But underlying demand was weaker than the headline number indicated. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose a slightly-above-forecast 1.2 per cent, while business investment cooled. A Federal Reserve-preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, slowed to 1.3 per cent, well below policy makers’ 2 per cent objective.Even so, the data showing faster growth and tame inflation helped push Treasury yields lower Friday. U.S. stocks were little changed after paring earlier losses.The first acceleration in GDP since mid-2018 reflected the largest combined boost since 2013 for two typically volatile components — inventories and trade — that could weigh on the economy later in the year. While steady wage gains and the Fed’s forbearance on interest-rate hikes will help make the expansion the nation’s longest on record in July, the fading impact of tax cuts and a global slowdown mean President Donald Trump’s goal of sustained 3 per cent growth will still be difficult to reach.While 3.2 per cent is a “great number,” consumer spending “has to get stronger for the economy to remain in an expansion,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc. “We think it will, but it’s not a silver lining. Underneath the hood, household spending was soft and further expansion is going to require households to get back to a normal space of spending.”What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“While this is encouraging news at face value, particularly given the growth concerns that rattled economic sentiment around the turn of the year, a closer inspection exposes a much more sluggish underlying profile. Much of what made first-quarter GDP look great, will make second-quarter GDP look considerably weaker — namely an unaddressed inventory overhang.” — Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economistsThe growth pickup mainly reflected a downturn in imports, greater state and local government spending, and rising inventories that were partially offset by slower consumer spending and fixed investment, the Commerce Department said in a statement Friday with the GDP data.The pickup in growth came despite the federal government shutdown through most of January, which subtracted 0.3 percentage point from the quarterly growth pace on the reduction in services. Commerce said the closure also chopped the fourth quarter by 0.1 point, while adding that the full effects can’t be quantified.Other recent reports have pointed to signs of strength, with March retail sales rebounding and a proxy for business investment rising sharply. U.S. stocks also rallied the most since 2009 in the first quarter and this month extended gains to a record, easing some concern about the durability of growth.Fed MeetingFed policy makers next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data.At the same time, trade tension is fuelling concern about the world economy, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis. Data this week showed world trade volumes falling the most since 2009 in the three months through February, while export-dependent South Korea saw its biggest GDP contraction in a decade.Friday’s report showed net exports added 1.03 percentage point to growth while rising private inventories added 0.65 point. The combined boost of 1.68 point was the biggest in six years.Excluding government and the volatile trade and inventory components, final sales to private domestic purchasers cooled to a 1.3 per cent pace that was the slowest since 2013. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand, especially in a period like the first quarter when rising inventories and a narrower trade deficit propped up GDP.The report showed non-residential business investment rose 2.7 per cent, reflecting the third straight decline in structures and a 0.2 per cent advance for equipment spending that was the weakest since 2016.Residential real estate was a drag on growth for the fifth straight quarter, contracting at a 2.8 per cent annual pace and subtracting 0.11 percentage point from the pace of GDP gains, as housing starts and sales remained relatively sluggish. At the same time, the sector is starting to regain some steam amid lower mortgage rates and more-affordable properties.With assistance from Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, Shelly Hagan, Alyza Sebenius, Alister Bull and Justin SinkBloomberg.com",,1,,0,growth accelerated,,,,

Monday’s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country’s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.“It’s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,” Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are “quite a lot to bear” if sustained, Caranci added.

The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growthBeata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank 
 
“Given market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 — in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week’s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.Trudeau’s TurnThe Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada’s oil sector isn’t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.“Yes, it’s a negative, that’s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,” Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada’s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country’s financial system.According to the finance department’s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government’s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall’s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

However, it’s difficult to know “how loudly the alarm bell is ringing” because the publicly released figures don’t distinguish between cash flow and balance sheet insolvencies, the C.D. Howe Institute said in a blog posting.Balance sheet insolvency is when a person is still unable to pay off debts, even after selling off all of their assets. Cash flow insolvency, on the other hand, is when a person can’t pay off debts because of difficulties selling their assets. Of the two, balance sheet insolvency is more serious.

“It’s hard to sell your house at a moment’s notice, but that’s really a matter of being illiquid, and not what economists would typically think of as insolvency,” said Jeremy Kronick, associate director of research at C.D. Howe and one of the report’s authors. “There’s a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and not.”There's a big difference between selling all your assets and still being in debt, versus selling them all and notJeremy Kronick, C.D.

Along with near-record debt-service ratios and rising borrowing costs, rising insolvencies are adding to concern about the sustainability of the country’s lofty household debt levels. To determine how significant the increase in insolvencies is, Kronick argues data at the individual level is needed.No DistinctionThe Ottawa-based Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies separates insolvencies into bankruptcies and so-called proposals, when a debtor agrees with creditors to pay off a certain portion of the debt over time. The OSB’s monthly and quarterly reports give the volume of insolvencies, without disclosing liabilities and assets. It discloses those in its annual reports, but aggregated by city and region.“Bankruptcies and consumer proposals include both cash-flow and balance sheet insolvencies,” a spokesman for the OSB said by email. “No distinction is made under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act between those two types of insolvencies.”In addition to calling for more detailed insolvency data, the researchers argue some of the warnings about Canada’s rising debt loads may be overstated, given the country’s debt-to-net worth ratio has stayed relatively constant at 20% since 2007, even though debt-to-GDP has risen to 100%, from 75%.“We’re not saying all’s well,” Kronick said. “We’re just trying to say there’s a big difference that we should recognize, but we can’t because we don’t have enough here to tell us.”Bloomberg.com",,1,,1,not as bad as surface number,,,,

Morgan Stanley sees recession within year if trade war gets any worse
The Bank of Canada is very worried about the U.S.-China trade war getting worse, Wilkins says
BoC upbeat about outlook as it leaves rates unchanged, but will proceed with caution
“There’s just no latent capacity to spend or to buffer a shock in Canada, and the U.S. is very well positioned,” Lascelles said by phone from Toronto. “You could lose your job and you would be okay in the U.S., or rates could go up and you’d be fine, or the economy could turn down and spending could continue. In Canada, you can’t really say that.”Here are three indicators that show why financial strains are higher in Canada — and one that shows why the country’s vulnerability to a shock may actually be receding.Canada’s household savings rate fell to 1.1 per cent in the first quarter. “That’s about as low as it gets, historically,” said Lascelles. It compares with 6.7 per cent in the U.S. The disparity between the two rates hasn’t been this wide since the 1970s. The lower the savings rate, the less of a cushion households will have to weather tough economic times.“If there were to be a recession, whether it’s in 2019 or 2029, or sometime in between, you can imagine Canadians getting hit a little harder than Americans,” Lascelles said in a separate webcast. “They just have less room for error, less room to cushion any kind of hit with spending, before they would actually fall into outright dissavings.”Debt-to-Income RatioCanada’s ratio of debt to income reached 176 per cent in the fourth quarter, among the highest in the developed world. That compares with a U.S. rate of 133 per cent. Canada’s households are “substantially more leveraged” than those in the U.S., Lascelles said.Debt Service RatioIn Canada, the debt service ratio — the amount of disposable income that goes to paying interest and principal on debt — climbed to 14.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest since 2007. “It’s about as much money as people have spent servicing debt, on an interest plus a principal basis, since records began in 1990,” Lascelles said. “That’s a concern.”Because the countries measure the DSR differently, finding a direct U.S. comparison is tricky. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements, which applies a common methodology across countries, the debt service ratio of 13.3 per cent in Canada compares with 7.9 per cent in the U.S., another sign Americans have more room to breath should economic conditions deteriorate.On the flip side, Canadian household debt vulnerabilities have improved, Lascelles said, citing an indicator called the Credit-to-GDP gap developed by the BIS. The metric shows how fast credit is rising relative to normal.“It doesn’t look as though an utter disaster is in the offing,” Lascelles said. “The vulnerability seems mostly to do with how quickly the household credit is accumulating, compared to normal. It’s not whether you have a lot of debt, it’s whether you accumulated it recently. In Canada’s case, most of the accumulation was a while ago.”If the housing market implodes — which Lascelles isn’t expecting — it would be the people who got in last who would be most vulnerable, he said, because they would have the lowest equity stake and they would be underwater on their mortgage first. “And so to the extent we haven’t seen credit grow as quickly, there aren’t as many households that are vulnerable.”He added: “It’s not obvious there’s a debt crisis in the making though. It’s just one that’s going to limit consumer spending and limit the economy more generally.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

Value investing is dead.During previous bouts, Warren Buffett, America’s patron saint of investing offered his sage — and inevitably unpopular — perspective. When the dot-com mania raged in the late 1990s, he famously warned against chasing internet stocks. And during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, he implored investors not to give up on U.S. stocks. Of course, neither episode turned out to be different from the innumerable ones that preceded it, at least when it comes to investing.This time, Buffett has been uncharacteristically missing from the chatter, but that doesn’t mean his views are any less clear, or any less worth paying attention to. 
Just what is Warren Buffett getting up to in Europe?

Let’s start with Buffett’s favourite stock market barometer, the market capitalization-to-GDP ratio. As its name suggests, it measures the total value of the stock market as a percentage of GDP. In simple terms, a lower ratio is bullish and a higher one is bearish.The ratio was prescient during the last two downturns. It shot up to 146 per cent at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, a record at the time and well above its average of 89 per cent since 1975, according to numbers compiled by the World Bank. It peaked again at 137 per cent just before the financial crisis in 2007. Where is the market cap-to-GDP ratio now? It notched a fresh high of 154 per cent in 2017, according to the latest available number, and is almost certainly higher today given that the U.S. stock market is up roughly 7 per cent since the end of 2017.So it’s probably safe to say that Buffett doesn’t love the lofty level of the stock market. And judging by the record US$122 billion of cash he’s hoarding at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it’s also safe to assume he doesn’t expect the market to remain elevated forever. Buffett’s cash pile is more than half the value of Berkshire’s US$208-billion portfolio of public companies, and since 1987 his cash allocation as a percentage of Berkshire’s portfolio was only higher in the years leading up to the financial crisis.At the same time, the few stocks that do appeal to Buffett suggest his faith in value investing is unshaken despite a miserable decade of underperformance for the strategy. Roughly 45 per cent of Berkshire’s stock portfolio is allocated to the financial sector, and eight of the portfolio’s top 12 holdings are financial stocks — a deeply contrarian bet. The sector has been hampered for much of the last decade by tighter regulation and low interest rates. While profits have picked up recently, many investors fear that a prolonged period of low rates will keep a lid on profits for the foreseeable future.

As a result, the financial sector has been one of the cheapest sectors by most measures for years. It’s still the most represented sector in many value indexes, including a 21 per cent allocation in the S&P 500 Value Index and 23 per cent in the Russell 1000 Value Index. That’s apparently not enough for Buffett, whose allocation to the sector is double that.Much has been made of Buffett’s uncharacteristic pivot to technology stocks in recent years, but that, too, is mostly a value play. Apple Inc. makes up nearly 90 per cent of Berkshire’s 27 per cent allocation to the technology sector. When Buffett began buying Apple in early 2016, it was a bona fide value stock. It boasted an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6, based on 12-month trailing earnings per share, and an average price-to-cash flow ratio of 7.5 during the first quarter of that year, well below the S&P 500’s P/E ratio of 19.5 and P/CF ratio of 10.9. Apple is pricier today, but it’s still the largest name in the S&P 500 Value Index, with a hefty 8.3 per cent allocation.Buffett has said that he regrets passing on Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. when the companies were younger, but don’t mistake the maestro. The fact that he isn’t loading up on them today, despite having plenty of cash to do so, speaks volumes. Amazon trades at a jaw-dropping P/E ratio of 73 and Alphabet at 27, which is the furthest thing from value. Buffett already has a small 0.5 per cent allocation to Amazon on the recommendation of one of his deputies. Don’t count on him making meaningfully more room for Amazon or Google at current prices.For now, Buffett is paying a price for his dissent.  Berkshire’s return trailed the S&P 500 by 0.9 percentage points a year from 2009 to 2018, including dividends. It’s not the first time. Buffett lagged the market by 3.2 percentage points a year around the Nifty Fifty craze from 1971 to 1975 and by 6.1 percentage points a year during the dot-com boom from 1995 to 1999.Still, Berkshire’s portfolio remains unabashedly Buffett: big profits at a reasonable cost. The portfolio has a weighted-average return on capital of 12 per cent, compared with just 7.9 per cent for the S&P 500. And it’s far cheaper. Buffett’s portfolio has a P/E ratio of 16.5, based on 12-month trailing operating earnings per share, compared with 21 for the S&P 500.There’s little indication, in other words, that Buffett is wavering from his long-standing investing principles. It’s a timely example, even if Buffett is no longer eager to say so.Bloomberg.com",,0,not related to econ,0,,,,,

With only an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of storage capacity still available, producers will be forced to cut output because by June there’ll be no place left to put the unwanted crude, it said.The oil market has been hammered by falling demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Saudi Arabia vows to flood the market with crude at deep discounts, following the collapse of the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full. Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, two of the world’s top merchants, say there’s heavy interest in storing while several traders have booked supertankers to hoard barrels at sea.

Supply may exceed demand by 12.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, with other traders, banks and consultants also forecasting bumper surpluses, IHS said. Vitol said on Wednesday that demand has fallen as much as 20 million barrels a day from last year.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”U.S. ConcernsThere are already signs in prices about a potential scarcity of storage space. In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world’s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said. Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up. Saudi Arabia has 18 days, and the U.S. has 30.Nigeria, the biggest producer in Africa, is the most vulnerable among the areas measured by IHS. Estimated first-quarter 2020 daily production of 1.9 million barrels a day would fill up available local storage in 1 1/2 to two days, the firm said.Consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. also sees storage tanks filling in the coming months.“With OPEC pushing output to record highs, inventories will quickly get out of hand,” the firm said in a note. “We will run out of crude storage capacity by early Q3 20, with product containment arriving earlier.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,oil producers forced to cut output,-1,,,,,

European bonds edged lower, while gilts were steady.Investors began the week with analysts predicting the Fed will trim rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday and then signal it’s done with easing for now. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously said the wider U.S. economy is in a good place, yet citing slowing global growth and uncertainty around trade as risk factors. After several corporate earnings reports last week seemed to underscore that view, Alphabet is set to release results on Monday.

"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Theophilos Argitis,"Liberal promises will lead to four more years of deficits, each above $20 billion","That’s despite new revenues including 3% tax on digital giants and luxury tax on $100,000 plus cars and boats",https://business.financialpost.com/news/election-2019/liberal-promises-will-lead-to-four-more-years-of-deficits-each-above-20-billion,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/justin-trudeau-1.jpg,"September 30, 2019 9:27 AM EDT","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, fighting for his political life three weeks away from an election, is seeking a second mandate from voters to increase the nation’s debt to deliver tax cuts and spending.
In a costed platform released Sunday, the incumbent Liberals detailed a $57 billion plan over four years — worth about half a per cent of annual gross domestic product — and pledged to pay for it with fresh borrowing, should they retain power.
The plan represents a doubling down by Trudeau on deficit spending his team says is needed to stoke growth and provide struggling households, many of them with high levels of personal debt, with help. The prime minister’s critics, however, say the Liberals have been spending too much in good times and aren’t setting enough fiscal ammunition aside for when a recession hits.
Under the Liberal plan, Canada’s deficit would peak at $27.4 billion next year, bringing it above 1 per cent of GDP for the first time since 2012, before dropping to $21 billion by 2023. That far exceeds the $14 billion deficit recorded in 2018. In total, the plan would add an additional $31.5 billion in deficits and bring the cumulative budget gap over the next four years to $93 billion.
Politically, the Liberals hope the higher deficits will give them a potential wedge issue in a campaign where the two major parties have rolled out similar policy objectives — from tax cuts to helping first time home buyers and seniors. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has yet to release his full fiscal projection but has promised to eventually return the budget to balance, though only over five years.
Rate Implications
In fact, given Scheer’s reluctance for a quick return to balance, both the Liberal and Conservative plans are poised to deliver a boost to the economy next year, no matter who wins. It’s perhaps even enough to prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider cutting interest rates, according to Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
“It seems clear whoever is in power, you are looking at a bigger deficit than had there not been an election,” Perrault said in a telephone interview.
Opinion polls show the Liberals are running neck and neck with the Conservatives, despite Trudeau’s campaign being jolted by revelations he wore black and brownface makeup numerous times as a younger man. Seat projections tabulated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show neither party holding enough support to win a majority.
Deficits matter in Canada, with a collective aversion to debt that was cemented in the mid-1990s amid ratings agency downgrades, a falling currency and a national unity crisis. It remains an explosive issue, even though Trudeau’s deficits have hovered at less than 1 per cent of GDP, far below many other western nations. The U.S. budget deficit is close to 5 per cent of GDP.
In the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau pledged to run deficits but for only three years and no more than a cumulative $25 billion. By 2019, Canada’s budget would be back in balance.
Since taking power however, his budget gaps have escalated and Trudeau has abandoned any willingness to balance the budget. In fact, he’s using his deficits as a lever to attack the opposition Conservatives, claiming they plan to bring austerity measures that will slow the economy and eliminate government services.
“I will let the Conservatives explain why cuts and austerity — if they really think so — are going to help Canadians,” Trudeau told reporters at a Toronto-area campaign stop Sunday.
Deficit Track
Trudeau’s first three budgets were in the negative by a cumulative $52 billion. His last budget in March projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of about $20 billion.
The Liberals would retain their existing fiscal anchor, which is to keep the nation’s debt as a share of GDP on a downward trajectory — but just barely. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 30.2 per cent by 2023, from 30.9 per cent last year. That’s well above the 28.6 per cent the government had projected in four years’ time in its last budget in March. They also pledged to preserve Canada’s AAA credit rating.
There are new revenue raising measures, totalling $25.4 billion over four years, in the Liberal platform.
The tax measures announced Sunday are short on details, but will be focused on corporations and wealthier Canadians, according to the documents. The Liberals believe they can raise an additional $2 billion as early as next year by undertaking “a new comprehensive review of government spending and tax expenditures, to ensure that wealthy Canadians do not benefit from unfair tax breaks.”
They also expect to raise $1.7 billion in 2020 by cracking down on corporate tax loopholes that allow companies to deduct debt. Other new measures include a 3 per cent value-added-tax on digital companies with worldwide revenue of more than $1 billion. It would take effect April 1 and be expected to raise more than $500 million next year. The Liberals also plan to impose a 10 per cent luxury tax on cars and boats worth more than $100,000.

Speculation had been rising that the Bank of Canada would announce another surprise cut to interest rates at the same time as the government’s aid package.

He added the central bank could “very well go to zero today, in a move that would accompany the fiscal package and send a strong signal that monetary-fiscal coordination is no longer just theory.”Another 50 basis point cut by the Bank of Canada would bring its policy rate to 0.25 per cent, matching its lowest level on record.

The results are surprising: In some cases they contradict other Statistics Canada data on pot use, while shedding light on the potential size of the black market.When cannabis is consumed, the body converts THC into THC-COOH, which can then be measured in wastewater — a nice word for sewage. Of the five cities measured between March 2018 and February 2019, Halifax, Nova Scotia had the highest average “load” of THC-COOH per capita, followed by Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton.

The fact that Halifax residents are peeing out more cannabis residue than anyone else isn’t surprising, as Statistics Canada’s National Cannabis Survey found that 24 per cent of Nova Scotians reported using pot in the second quarter, the highest of any province.What’s surprising is that Montreal’s levels are so high, when only 10 per cent of Quebecers reported cannabis use in the second quarter, the lowest of any province. Edmonton’s low wastewater results are also confounding, as Alberta had the third-highest reported cannabis use at 20 per cent.So are people lying or is wastewater an imperfect measure? It could be a bit of both. Statistics Canada acknowledges the difficulty of getting people to accurately divulge their pot use.“The stigma associated with use and reluctance to disclose purchases from non-regulated suppliers are two factors that could contribute to some under-reporting on surveys,” it said in the wastewater report.In analyzing the Montreal wastewater data, the agency said factors beyond simple cannabis use per capita could be skewing the results. “It is possible that the consumption per user could be greater,” according to the report. “It is also possible that cannabis use in Montreal is measurably higher than for the rest of Quebec.”Pot GDPThe cannabis sector contributed $8 billion to Canadian gross domestic product in June, up from $6.5 billion a year earlier. The numbers show a significant increase from April onward, signalling that Ontario’s belated opening of retail stores had a notable impact on the pot industry’s contribution to GDP. The sector is still one of the smallest tracked by Statistics Canada, trailing the $13 billion from the media and content industry.Legal sales are gaining ground on the illicit market. The size of the unlicensed cannabis industry shrank 26 per cent in the year through June, while licensed sales rose over fourfold, according to the data.Meanwhile, Health Canada reported that legal sales of dried cannabis increased by 4.7 per cent in June from May, while legal sales of cannabis oil fell 2.1 per cent. Interestingly, that decline was entirely from the medical market, where sales tumbled 18 per cent; recreational oil sales increased 19 per cent.This data conflicts with Canopy Growth Corp.’s experience in the quarter ended June 30, when it took an $8 million revenue adjustment to reflect potential returns of oils and softgels due to oversupply in the recreational market. Meanwhile, 46 per cent of its medical sales came from oils and softgels, up from 17 per cent a year earlier.Bloomberg.com",,0,,1,contribution to GDP rising,,,,

At the same time, Poloz used much of the speech to tout the economy’s ability to adjust, aided by a flexible exchange rate, and to find new sources of growth. He cited recent data — the latest GDP number showed the economy expanded at a better-than-expected 0.3 per cent pace in January — to highlight his optimism a recent slowdown will be temporary.“There are challenges in the Canadian and global economies that we need to manage, but there are clear signs that Canada is adjusting to the challenges,” he said. “Recent economic data have been generally consistent with our expectation that the period of below-potential growth will prove to be temporary.”Yield CurvePoloz’s comments are the first since a segment of Canada’s yield curve considered a potential recession signal inverted March 22 for the first time in more than a decade, prompting investors to speculate the Bank of Canada’s next move will be a rate cut instead of an increase.Poloz is one of the few central bankers worldwide still talking about the need — at least over time — for rates to move higher. He didn’t make any explicit reference in his speech about raising borrowing costs, but his comment that interest rates remain below neutral suggest the Bank of Canada’s models still see scope for borrowing costs to continue rising in the longer term — unless officials dramatically change their estimates for neutral.The Bank of Canada’s latest estimates put the neutral rate at between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, versus a policy rate of 1.75 per cent.Positive ToneIn his remarks, the Canadian central banker highlighted how the global economy has seen a slowdown in trade and investment because of heightened trade uncertainty, and he warned the impact could be permanent even if tensions are resolved.But Poloz used much of the speech to strike a positive tone about the economy’s ability to adjust, even in the face of heightened trade uncertainty.He said officials expect both exports and investment to return to “positive growth” later this year. He underscored strength in the labour market and how adjustments to the oil sector will “eventually be completed.” Poloz also cited anecdotal evidence from firms telling officials “they need to make new investments,” aided by recent tax cuts by the federal government on capital costs.The Canadian central banker also highlighted the contributions that a floating exchange rate can make to the adjustment process.“We only have to look back a few years for an example,” said Poloz, “following the oil price collapse of 2015.”He also cited “numerous advantages” beyond natural resources that are acting as buffers for the economy and helping to create growth — including a well-educated workforce growing through immigration, fast growth in key services-related industries and a “portfolio” of trade agreements.In his speech, Poloz said that officials — after taking into account structural adjustments in the oil sector — can “see many areas of encouraging economic growth” in both traditional and cutting-edge export sectors.“These data suggest that the mixed picture offered up by the Canadian economy today reflects some important structural changes beneath the surface,” Poloz said. “Judging what all this means for the outlook for inflation is of course a challenge for us.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,trade uncertainty,-1,,,,,

Some economists expect China to set a lower growth target of either about 6 per cent, or from 6 to 6.5 per cent — down from around 6.5 per cent for the past two years.Key Chinese data will also be released over coming weeks, indicating whether or not the world’s second-largest economy is responding to policy easing after months of stimulus.“March data will need to start showing China’s economy is recovering,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. “If not, we should start worrying.”March data will need to start showing China's economy is recovering.

Chief Economist Jan Hatzius believes the global economy may have already bottomed out, the risk to Goldman’s global GDP forecast of 3.5 per cent for 2019 remains to the downside.“The coming weeks may bring more clarity over Brexit, U.S. tariff threats to EU auto producers and whether Beijing is succeeding in re-stimulating China’s growth,” said Sarah Hewin, chief economist for Europe and Americas at Standard Chartered Bank. “A benign outcome in each case could improve the outlook for exporters and broader business sentiment.”",,0,,0,,,,,

That framework is facing a serious challenge from historically low neutral rates, which may diminish the bank’s ability to combat future downturns and encourages households to take on excessive risk.“There is no doubt that our inflation-targeting framework has promoted the economic and financial well-being of Canadians,” Wilkins said in prepared remarks on the Bank of Canada’s preparations ahead of the mandate’s renewal in 2021. “A decade of experience in the post-crisis world, though, shows us it is not perfect. It is time to conduct a thorough review of the alternatives,” she said.Canada’s economic Achilles heel: A mountain of household debtMortgage risks fading as Bank of Canada sees dramatic drop in highly indebted borrowersBanks’ advice to Stephen Poloz: Consider Alberta’s oil woes before plotting your next rate moveThe comments are the strongest indication yet that the central bank will seriously consider changes to a framework that came into effect in the early 1990s and requires the bank to narrowly focus on a single objective: to keep prices stable.2 Per CentOperationally, that means aiming for a 2 per cent inflation target over its so-called forecast horizon of about two years — though some flexibility has been built into the system.The inflation targeting framework and overall focus on price stability — which is widely followed in many advanced economies — has been faulted for helping to fuel the financial imbalances that led to the last global crisis, and also proved to be insufficient in giving economies enough firepower to help recover from the recession.Wilkins pointed out the regime could be challenged in the future by the long-term trend of falling global rates, which means borrowing costs will remain low even after the central bank removes all its stimulus. That will give it less firepower in the event it needs to respond to an economic downturn.Low borrowing costs also mean the economy will continue to be exposed to “booom-bust” financial cycles under inflation targeting, since it encourages households to take on debt.“My bottom line here is that although our inflation-targeting framework has served us very well, we should look for ways to improve it,” Wilkins said.Three CriteriaThe Bank of Canada will use three criteria to assess alternatives: the objectives should be short-term stabilization and cyclical issues rather than long-term matters, they need to support the greater good and consider implications on things like income distribution and financial stability, and they need to be robust in bad times as well as good.Wilkins outlined some of the pros and cons of some alternatives: raising the inflation target, targeting the price level, developing a dual mandate and targeting nominal GDP.The central bank will also need to examine how to improve the clarity around its toolkit of unconventional policies, which will be needed regardless of what framework is in place, Wilkins said. Another question for policy makers, according to Wilkins, is what role is there for fiscal and macroprudential policies to help reduce the burden on monetary policy.–With assistance from Erik Hertzberg.Bloomberg.com",,-1,many post-crisis worries,-1,,,,,

Debt from all sectors — ranging from household to government to corporate bonds — surged.“While borrowing costs remain very low, many countries are finding a debt-driven growth model increasingly difficult to maintain,” said Sonja Gibbs, managing director of global policy initiatives at the institute. “High and rising debt-to-GDP ratios are making debt service and refinancing more challenging, and the 2020s are likely to see a greater incidence of debt distress and restructuring.”

Private capital turned against him long before that.Ever since dozens of royals and business chiefs were detained in November 2017 as part of a declared crackdown on corruption, a growing number of rich Saudis have been trying to move money out of the kingdom or draw up plans to leave, according to interviews with more than 10 people familiar with the matter. They all spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive.Saudis who stayed put are mostly parking their cash instead of increasing investments, adding to the headwinds buffeting the biggest Arab economy. Khashoggi’s killing has only intensified the trends, some of the people said.Penalty for cancelling Saudi arms contract ‘in the billions,’ Trudeau saysIn the shadow of a killing, Saudi Arabia’s investment summit loses its swagger as scrutiny mountsSaudi crown prince’s carefully managed rise hides dark sidePrince Mohammed’s grip on power has survived Khashoggi’s death at the hands of government agents in Istanbul. But losing the confidence of local elites could wreck his most fundamental reform. Saudi wealth is supposed to be building a private sector capable of replacing state oil revenue as the main engine of growth — not staying on the sidelines or trying to flee the country.Even worse, jitters among local capitalists have spread to their foreign counterparts, who are also largely shunning the prince’s project. “A lot of people are afraid of Saudi Arabia,” veteran emerging-market investor Mark Mobius told Bloomberg TV.Watershed MomentThe crackdown, whose targets were detained in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton hotel, capped a series of steps that had hurt business confidence. Payments owed to contractors were held up, and in June 2017 the kingdom led an unprecedented boycott of neighbouring Qatar.“Domestically, the Ritz arrests were a transformative development — economically and politically,” said Hani Sabra, founder of Alef Advisory, a New York-based consultancy. They were the “crystallization of a process that had been building.”Officials say the arrests were necessary to level the playing field among investors and curb rampant corruption — an argument that resonates with many Saudis who often complained that the elite were above the rule of law. Some of the prince’s supporters also say a short-term decline in investment is an acceptable price to pay for a fundamental overhaul that will help create a more transparent business community.The Saudi central bank, responding to Bloomberg questions, reiterated that the kingdom places “no restrictions on transfers.”But the scale of the purge, which ensnared people like billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, has left many worried about appearing to be rushing for the exit. To secure their release, detainees agreed to pay settlements that totaled more than US$100 billion. Allegations of torture — denied by the government — and the lack of transparency over settlements made the operation look more like a shakedown.As a result, some Saudis who did subsequently take money out of the country used a web of companies to disguise their ownership, and avoided places with close ties to the kingdom. Many looked to Switzerland or funds elsewhere in Europe, investing in real-estate and private equity funds, some of the people said.“It would be stupid not to make contingency plans,” one Saudi businessman said.One person involved in structuring international deals for Saudis said clients have been shying away from eye-catching purchases. Instead of buying a five-star hotel in London, for example, they would invest the same amount on warehouses in the north of England, the person said.‘Drawing Attention’Money was leaving the country before the purge, partly because the economy slowed as authorities imposed austerity in response to low oil prices, said Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. If anything, capital flight probably declined due to the “fear of drawing attention,” he said.Total outflows are estimated to rise 13 per cent this year to US$90 billion, about 10 per cent of GDP, compared with 2017, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.But such aggregate figures include foreign investments by state institutions. There’s no way to pinpoint how much private Saudi money has been trying to escape a country that’s embarked on aggressive new policies at home and abroad. (On the same day they rounded up business leaders, Saudi authorities are also widely believed to have put Lebanon’s visiting prime minister under effective house arrest.)The purge took place days after global executives attended the prince’s flagship Future Investment Initiative conference at the Ritz-Carlton and lavished praise on his economic plans.After the arrests, some major banks lowered their forecast for loans to businesses, a key gauge of domestic demand. That quarter, private growth slowed sharply — even though oil prices were rebounding.Lagging investment from locals and foreigners, added to new taxes and fees on expats, has helped push unemployment to the highest in more than a decade.‘Off My Map’In an interview the day after Khashoggi disappeared, Prince Mohammed said the jobless rate will start coming down next year. He also predicted a rebound in foreign investment — starting with a sizable non-oil deal to be announced at the FII conference later that month.But then the outcry over Khashoggi began to build, prompting bankers and executives to drop out and turning this year’s event into a subdued affair. The announcement never came.Saudi Arabia will find it hard to attract foreign money because of concerns about the way the country is run, Mobius said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Dubai. “If the leadership has questionable governance, how about the companies?”One regional investor, the head of an Arab family office who’s put money into the kingdom before, said he has no plans to do so again. “Saudi Arabia is off my map now,” he said, asking not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his existing business.His reasoning is simple. “If I see people taking their money out of Saudi Arabia, despite opportunities there, why should I bring my money?”–With assistance from Donna Abu-Nasr, Jan-Henrik Förster and Archana Narayanan.Bloomberg.com",,0,Saudi-specific,0,,,,,

The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

Governor Stephen Poloz has said how soon he adds to his five rate increases since mid-2017 will depend on fresh data, and that he needs to assess the drag from a drop in Alberta oil prices.There wasn’t much direct evidence of an energy slump in the October GDP figures. Oil and gas extraction climbed 3.6 per cent as producers returned sites to service after maintenance shutdowns. The provincial government in Alberta has ordered production cuts in January that could slow growth from here.“The Canadian economy managed to churn out hearty growth overall in October,” Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter said in a research note. The economy will expand at a 1.5 per cent annualized pace in the fourth quarter and slow to 1 per cent in the first three months of 2019, with output “particularly challenged” by Alberta’s oil curtailments, he said.The economy’s main weak point in October was the fifth straight decline in construction, which fell 0.1 per cent.The GDP report didn’t include figures on the sale of newly legal marijuana, with Statistics Canada planning to add them in March.

Key InsightsJanuary’s numbers were slightly affected by the outbreak in China through reduced trade and tourism, Statistics Canada said.Recent monthly GDP numbers do show some signs of recovery from a very weak end to 2019 — with three straight monthly gains between November and January — but that was all before the recent developments.The number will allow economists to fine tune their forecasts for first quarter growth, but expectations are for the quarter to show a contraction.The below-expected January number reinforces those estimates.Bloomberg.com",,-1,less-than-expected,-1,,,,,

According to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey, the country’s expansion slowed to a 1.3 per cent annualized pace in the three months through September, down from an unsustainable clip of 3.7 per cent in the prior period.It’s a return to sluggish growth that may become the new normal for a Canadian economy seeing many of its engines of growth sputter, from investment and exports to weakening consumption as the nation’s households cope with high debt levels.

Beyond the third quarter, economists predict another 1.3 per cent reading in the final three months of 2019. Next year doesn’t look much better, with growth seen running at about 1.5 per cent in 2020. That’s a sufficiently prolonged period of below-potential growth for markets to anticipate the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates as early as January.Canada’s exporters have floundered in the second half of the year. After a rebound in oil shipments temporarily boosted real exports in the second quarter, they’ve since flat-lined, falling 0.3 per cent since June in volume terms. Waning exports are also hitting manufacturers, whose shipment volumes decreased 1 per cent in the third quarter, led downward by oil and coal.You don't have a domestic demand story that's strongBrett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank 
 
Business investment remains sluggish, down 22 per cent since oil prices began collapsing in 2014. While the Bank of Canada’s latest indicator of business activity ticked up, the central bank still sees investment as a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2019 growth. Until global uncertainty and trade tensions abate, Canadian businesses are unlikely to make major capital expenditures.Consumption has long propelled Canada’s economic growth, but cracks may be forming, even with a robust job market and wages growing at the fastest pace in a decade. Economists expect consumption to pick up in the second half of the year, but that’s coming off a second quarter that was the slowest since 2012. The lack of vigour is most apparent in a retail sector that’s seen volumes flat over the past year.“You don’t have a domestic demand story that’s strong,” said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.One bright spot in the GDP numbers could be housing, which has rebounded as borrowing costs decline and buyers adjust to tighter mortgage rules. Home sales rose 7.3 per cent in the third quarter, the fastest quarterly pace since the end of 2017. Most economists estimate residential investment picked up for a second straight quarter.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

In an emergency statement, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will “strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets.” The Bank of England followed by saying it’s working with U.K. and international authorities to “ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.” Already on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates to contain what he called the “evolving risks” to economic growth from the virus. The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a ‘long lasting’ epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks’ action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points.

Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.“Global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. “We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.”With interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.“Central banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, ” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.Japan to IndonesiaThe Bank of Japan backed up Monday’s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia’s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan’s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan’s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed’s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn’t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde’s comments of last week.“We are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Less Effective?Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closed 
 
For central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That’s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world’s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won’t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they’re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.“Rate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,” said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011. Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Reed Stevenson,Michael Burry of 'The Big Short' slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm,Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg,"April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT","Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country’s  deepest-ever economic contractions, aren’t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.

Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”The U.S. Policy Response“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”Potential Treatments“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”Getting Back to Normal“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”Japan’s Response“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.”Business Recovery“Economically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.”“Countries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.”Bloomberg.com",,-1,about lockdown harming econ,-1,,,,,

Mega-mergers by Canada’s two largest gold companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc., stand to erode its global influence.The Barrick tie-up, with Channel Islands-based Randgold Resources Ltd., has already resulted in job cuts and further decentralization away from Canada, a trend that will likely increase under Barrick’s newly inked joint-venture in Nevada with Newmont Mining Corp. Meanwhile, Newmont’s proposed takeover of Goldcorp will see the combined entity headquartered in Colorado, with only a regional office remaining in Vancouver.

“For decades, our industry has been a leader in the production of minerals and metals. A leader in mining services and supplies. A leader in mine finance. A leader in sustainability and safety, but that position is in jeopardy and will be lost without continued, decisive action at both the federal and provincial levels,” Pierre Gratton, chief executive officer of the association said in a news release.Among the key findings in the report:Canada’s share of international exploration spending has fallen for six years in a row.Over five years, the country has lost its ‘top five’ ranking as a producer in seven out of 16 commodities where it held that position.Capital investment in the mining sector has fallen every year since 2012.Australia has extended its lead on Canada in terms of the number of companies supplying the sector and as a percentage of total foreign direct investment.Despite this, the sector still represents 5 per cent of total nominal GDP and 19 per cent of the value of Canadian goods exports in 2017.The Toronto Stock Exchange and Venture Exchange raised nearly one-third of the world’s total equity capital in the sector in 2017, making them top mining and exploration listing exchanges.Renewing the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit for a five-year term, along with other government initiatives, could help reverse the trend but more policies are required, the report concludes.Bloomberg.com",,-1,,-1,,,,,

The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as net earnings on cross-border investments and transfer payments.

“Countries that run current account deficits are countries that tend to pull the rating down,” said James McCormack, Fitch’s global head of sovereign & supranational group. Nonetheless, “Canada is building more external assets than external liabilities.”Canada historically had been a debtor nation, with net liabilities peaking at $333 billion US in 2011, according to Statistics Canada. But since then, the country has seen the value of its foreign assets more than double, helped in part by a weaker Canadian dollar. That outpaced a 72 per cent increase in liabilities. The nation turned from debtor to creditor in 2014.The $2.2 trillion US economy is supporting public sector debt — provincial and federal — equivalent to almost 90 per cent of its output, compared with an average of about 40 per cent for the 11 countries rated AAA by Fitch. Top-rated countries have on average been reporting current account surpluses while Canada has posted deficits of about two percentage points to almost four percentage points of gross domestic product in the last decade.Pension FundsThose weaknesses would put the country’s rating in the AA-range, were it not for a two-level uplift that Fitch applies to take into account issues including the net international investment position and unfunded pension commitments that are lower than its peers, wrote McCormack, who previously was a Bank of Canada official as well as a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni.Only Canada and Denmark are given that adjustment, said McCormack.Pension funds such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec are playing a key role in bolstering Canada’s presence abroad. Pension fund assets rose 53 per cent to $1.92 trillion US at the end of 2018 from $1.25 trillion US in the second quarter of 2011, according to Statistics Canada.Clear LiabilitiesCPPIB, which manages the pension savings of all Canadians except those in Quebec, had $302.3 billion US of investments overseas in the fiscal year ended March 2018, or almost 85 per cent of its assets under management, according to its annual report. Last month, it committed about $900 million US in a joint bid for U.K. satellite company Inmarsat Plc.Almost two-thirds of the Caisse’s $309.5 billion US of assets at the end of last year were invested outside of Canada. On April 5, the Caisse announced a deal with with France’s Engie SA to buy 90 per cent of Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s pipeline unit TAG for $8.6 billion US.Other big overseas investors include Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which has about $350 billion US under management.“Despite heavily financing ourselves abroad, Canadians have not dug themselves into a foreign debt hole,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said Friday in a separate note. “If we sold everything we’ve added to our balance sheets in assets abroad, as a country, we could clear our liabilities.”To be sure, the country’s international net international investment position may be not enough to protect the country’s top rating should public debt ratios head upward and rise over 90 per cent of GDP, said McCormick.Also, the country’s net international investment position declined by $109.1 billion US in the last quarter after reaching record $637.7 billion US at the end September, according to government data.Shenfeld also cautions that in the next downturn the value of Canada’s overseas assets may slip while the country will still have to make interest payments on debt held abroad.",,1,investments boost gdp,1,,,,,
