The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund\u2019s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.\u201cThe Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,\u201d the company said in a fund document on its website. \u201cThe social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.\u201dThe fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company\u2019s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.\u2018Pandemic Effects\u2019The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada\u2019s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201d The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn\u2019t say how long the freeze would last to \u201cavoid building unrealistic expectations\u201d.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello", "title": "A fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec", "description": "Quebec is urging its population to buy from local firms through an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/a-fight-against-amazon-becomes-a-state-matter-in-quebec", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/amazon-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 25, 2020 8:02 AM EDT", "content": "The coronavirus crisis is giving Quebec\u2019s nationalist government an excuse to attempt what may be impossible.The Canadian province is embarking on an uphill battle to chip away at Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s position. Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers\u2019 digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu \u2014 or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province\u2019s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe\u2019s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon\u2019s dominance. \nBezos, Musk among billionaires gaining net worth in pandemic -report\nAmazon moves to stock more non-essential items \u2014 but it\u2019s not business-as-usual\nCanada signs agreement with Amazon to manage distribution of medical equipment\n\u201cPeople will be able to see what\u2019s available in their region,\u201d Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.\u201dQuebec\u2019s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company\u2019s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,\u201d Lecours said. \u201cStill, let\u2019s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it\u2019s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?\u201dEfforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch \u2014 including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV\u2019s beer.\n\nQuebec Premier Francois Legault.\n\nJacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press\n\nWhen Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer \u2014 an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.\u201cAn initiative to promote local commerce isn\u2019t an initiative against free trade,\u201d Fitzgibbon said then. \u201cIt\u2019s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.\u201dThe Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn\u2019t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it\u2019s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the \u201cBuy Quebec\u201d movement to stay.\u201cNo one can compete with Amazon,\u201d she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don\u2019t sell on the behemoth\u2019s platform, \u201cwe have some exclusivity they don\u2019t have.\u201d\u2018I Made No Money\u2019Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling \u201cBlack Friday level traffic every day\u201d to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault\u2019s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.\u201cI made no money,\u201d he said. Shipping costs \u201cis what\u2019s hurting everyone.\u201dTaillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket\u2019s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers\u2019 attention.\u201cOur goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,\u201d he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, \u201cit will have been worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales plunge 69% in first half of April as buyers, sellers stay home", "description": "Prices dip 1.5%, signalling market still tight", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-plunge-69-in-first-half-of-april-prices-dip?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/house-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 7:36 AM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales and listings plunged in the first part of April as the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand in Canada\u2019s largest city.Greater Toronto saw 1,654 home sales in the first 17 days of April, a 69 per cent drop from the same period a year ago.

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada\u2019s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What\u2019s more, its households are among the world\u2019s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm. \nHome sales activity crashed last month, but here\u2019s why property prices will not \u2014 for now\nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nHow to buy and sell a house in the time of coronavirus, from virtual tours to hazmat home inspections\n\u201cI think it is the Great Reckoning,\u201d says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a period for so long where it didn\u2019t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were.

Real estate has become Canada\u2019s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.\n\nResidential condo buildings and single family houses are seen above Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDarryl Dyck/Bloomberg files\n\nThat virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted \n \nToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dAirbnb Customers VanishIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.\n\nThe logo of the online lodging service Airbnb on a smartphone.\n\nLionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nThen there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove, Sandrine Rastello, Kait Bolongaro and Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Provinces take baby steps in coming up with plans to get people back to work", "description": "Effort likely to be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks \u2014 and it will be months, if not longer, before country runs anywhere near capacity", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-provinces-covid-19-return-work-plans?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/legault.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 10:53 AM EDT", "content": "When workers at Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. report back to work Wednesday at the LaRonde gold mine in Quebec\u2019s Abitibi region, they\u2019ll arrive in staggered groups at three separate entrances.

California and some of America\u2019s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has \u201ctotal\u201d authority to reopen the world\u2019s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is \u201ccoordinating\u201d his country\u2019s response.\u201cWe are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,\u201d he said a news conference in Ottawa. \u201cWe recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We\u2019re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we\u2019re going to reopen the economy. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be a while still.\u201dDiscussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillJustin Trudeau \n \nIn Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company\u2019s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company\u2019s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.\u201cWe can\u2019t be locked down forever,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThe virus will still be around us. It won\u2019t be eradicated so it\u2019s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.\u201dAny return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Cautious StepsDr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia\u2019s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions \u201cto get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,\u201d but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak\u2019s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.\u201cWe will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,\u201d Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back onlineFrances Donald \n \n\u201cThe services side of the business, that\u2019s harder,\u201d Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg television. \u201cYou can open your coffee shop again, but if people don\u2019t feel confident to go to it, then you\u2019re not going to see your economy come back online.\u201dAgnico-Eagle\u2019s Boyd said the return to work is strictly voluntary. The company has 900 permanent staff at the LaRonde mine.\u201cIt will be gradual and if we see things that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, clearly we won\u2019t go forward with it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Catherine Bosley, Max Reyes and Jeff Green", "title": "Millennials are getting crushed by back-to-back economic crises", "description": "Economic downturns are inevitable, but they're not usually so severe.

The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They\u2019re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, \u201cI worry even more about the people without college diplomas.\u201d\n\nBaby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs.\n\nJohannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nWhile white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall.

It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt \n \nHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dRebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada ramps up asset buying to backstop coronavirus-slammed economy", "description": "CMHC announced Thursday it will buy up to $150 billion of mortgages from banks, triple the amount announced two weeks ago", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-ramps-up-asset-buying-to-backstop-virus-slammed-economy?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/poloz-6.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 1:26 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s government and central bank are gearing up to acquire hundreds of billion of dollars in assets from the financial system in coming weeks in order to keep markets running smoothly during the pandemic-induced economic shutdown.The national housing agency announced Thursday it will buy up to $150 billion (US$107 billion) of mortgages from banks, triple the amount announced two weeks ago, to pump money into the economy hit hard by social-distancing measures and mandated business closures. The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers. \nOttawa asks banks, credit-card companies to lower interest rates\n\u2018We will overcome this:\u2019 G20 leaders vow to strengthen global financial safety net\nJack M. Mintz: Canada needs to think BIG now to avoid a long, deep recession\n\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Paula Sambo", "title": "Canada beefs up liquidity plan with pledge to buy up to $50 billion in uninsured mortgages", "description": "Changes will allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canada-beefs-up-liquidity-plan-with-expanded-mortgage-guarantee", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 20, 2020 2:14 PM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government announced it will guarantee previously uninsured mortgages, allowing it to acquire these loans in a $50 billion (US$34.8 billion) state purchase program.The step is aimed at making it easier for smaller institutions \u2014 which may not have enough insured loans \u2014 to participate in the liquidity boosting plan, analysts said.\u201cThese are extraordinary times and we are taking extraordinary measures,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this measure, banks and lenders will have more liquidity \u2014 which, in turn, will enable them to work on a case by case basis with Canadian businesses and individuals who face hardship at this time.\u201d \nAlmost 33% of Canadian households rent their homes.

Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.\u201dCrane operators have been called the \u201crock stars\u201d of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeMathew Tiburcio, crane operator \n \nIt\u2019s part of a decade-long building boom in North America\u2019s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada\u2019s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He\u2019s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada\u2019s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.\n\nCranes operate over the CIBC Square construction site in Toronto.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nTiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane\u2019s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He\u2019ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane\u2019s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.\u201cYou\u2019ve got many trades that need the crane and you\u2019re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,\u201d said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. \u201cEverybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.\u201dAt 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.\n\nToronto has more cranes than any other city in North America.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nBut the job hasn\u2019t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who\u2019s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.\u201cHe already knows all about tower cranes,\u201d Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio\u2019s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He\u2019s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him.

The figures mark a divergence from the U.S., where women eclipsed men as the majority of jobholders.The fastest pace of immigration in the Group of Seven is a big factor behind the trend in Canada, spurring a housing boom that\u2019s pushing up demand for everything from plumbers to electricians. A fast-track visa process is also pulling in workers to the male-dominated field of technology, while male immigrants are more likely than women to work outside the home. \nCanada\u2019s economy has \u2018free money lying on the sidewalk\u2019 and nobody is picking it up\nCanada\u2019s economy just had its second-best year for jobs since 2007\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nCanada notched another solid year of job gains in 2019, with the unemployment rate hovering near a four-decade low of 5.6 per cent. The female unemployment rate dipped even lower than men, reaching a record 4.9 per cent in May but the big job gains have skewed male.Jared Menkes, executive vice president at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd., said finding enough labour is a constant source of angst. Central Toronto posted the fastest-growing population in North America last year with a dozen office buildings and countless condos under construction, along with 25 light rail stations, hospitals and all sorts of infrastructure work.\u201cWe are short actual labour, whether it\u2019s a crane operator, whether it\u2019s drywallers, electricians, plumbers, drivers,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cWe\u2019re short truck drivers, architects, consultants.\u201dOntario LeadsTo be sure, the headline figures mask stark regional disparities that underscore the difficulties Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing. Much of the job creation has been in central Canada while parts of the West struggle with a slump in the energy sector that has gutted thousands of jobs. Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau\u2019s Liberals push to reduce Canada\u2019s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 \u2014 sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O\u2019Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario\u2019s resurgence.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in life,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto\u2019s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think since this job started I\u2019ve worked less than a 60-hour week.\u201d\n\nThe CIBC Square tower under construction in Toronto.\n\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg files\n\nJust under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has also clamped down on visas for the high-tech sector, a source of jobs growth in Canada.Male immigrants are more likely to participate in the workforce than women, who often face additional barriers, according to Parisa Mahboubi, a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto.\u201cGenerally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cHowever, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.\u201dTech ManiaThe broad-ranging category of \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical services,\u201d which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn\u2019t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that\u2019s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, managing director at hireVouch \n \nPatrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can\u2019t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.\u201cAlmost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hardest time if you\u2019re an employer, but if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.\u201dOutlookRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.\u201cA growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can\u2019t find work,\u201d Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O\u2019Neill, the crane operator, doesn\u2019t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.\u201cShe\u2019s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, too.

That reflects an economy running nicely at around its capacity \u2014 neither too hot nor too cold. \nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: Data warnings still flashing as Bank of Canada decides on rates\nRemember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nOil remains a pillar of Canada's economy, but it's the digital economy that's driving growth\nOf course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it\u2019s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than 1 per cent for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists.But the net effect of the changes isn\u2019t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada means the economy probably had less slack to begin with.A weak fourth quarter also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front.Home PricesOfficials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern.Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That\u2019s one more reason not to cut.Core MandateTo be sure, Poloz won\u2019t hesitate to lower rates if there\u2019s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank\u2019s primary inflation-targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern.So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While investors are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June.Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz\u2019s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008. So did Gordon Thiessen in 2001.That said, as long as the economy remains in a relatively good place and household debt levels continue to pick up, Poloz may be content to simply stand pat before he stands down.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Here's David Rosenberg's bear-case portfolio to help you weather a looming economic slowdown", "description": "Gold is a 'no-brainer'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/gold-is-a-no-brainer-in-rosenbergs-bear-case-portfolio?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/david-rosenberg.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 21, 2020 10:03 AM EST", "content": "Shelter in gold, bet on emerging markets and buy \u201cbonds in drag.\u201dSo says David Rosenberg who believes an economic slowdown is on its way despite enduring job gains, easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and record-breaking stock markets in North America.\u201cIf things are so great, why did the Fed have to cut rates last year?\u201d he said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cIf things are so great, why did the Fed have to embark on QE4, that we\u2019re not supposed to call QE4?\u201d \nDavid Rosenberg says energy shares are \u2018downright cheap\u2019 right now\n\u2018I\u2019m chasing a lifelong dream\u2019: David Rosenberg says opening his own shop not a response to Onex takeover\nDavid Rosenberg: The Fed seems to think we are in a happy economic place \u2014 but we aren\u2019t\nRosenberg started his own independent research firm in January \u2014 Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc. \u2014 after more than a decade as chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc.

Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor.

Employment intentions have also increased, along with signs of businesses running up against capacity.The composite gauge of sentiment rose to 0.74, which is the highest reading since the end of 2018 and the third-straight quarterly improvement.Results \u201csuggest that business sentiment is broadly positive except in the Prairies, where indicators remain weak,\u201d the Bank of Canada said in a summary of its findings. \u201cIn aggregate, firms\u2019 outlook is supported by expectations of healthy domestic and foreign sales.\u201dKey InsightsThat sentiment has improved at all may be a positive surprise for analysts, given early estimates for growth in the fourth quarter show a sharp slowdown at the end of last year The survey was conducted between Nov. 13 and Dec. 9, before two big breakthroughs on the global trade front \u2014 the final signing of the North American free trade agreement and the announcement of a U.S.-China agreement on a phase-one trade deal.

Fewer respondents, for example, expected a U.S. recession The survey questions with the biggest improvements were around indicators of future sales and employment intentions. The share of firms planning to expand their workforce rose to 53 per cent, the highest since the second quarter 2018. Indicators of future sales also rose to the strongest in more than a year Outside the energy-producing regions, reports of improved indicators of future sales are widespread, with businesses pointing to infrastructure and resource projects, population growth, consumer spending and housing activity supporting demand for their products \u201cThe share of firms reporting at least some capacity pressure edged up for a third straight quarter (53 per cent), in part because of labour shortages. That gauge is above its historical average of 43 per cent. The data suggest \u201ceconomic slack has been absorbed\u201d and that \u201clabour markets have tightened \u201cOn the down side, while businesses are reporting stronger bookings and orders, fewer firms expect sales growth to accelerate over the next 12 months. That share fell to 43 per cent, from 48 per cent in the previous survey. Still, that\u2019s above the share of firms who anticipate a deceleration, at 32 per cent Investment intentions also eased at the end of last year, with just 35 per cent of businesses saying they expect higher investment in machinery and equipment.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Canadian housing starts miss forecasts for the third straight month", "description": "Still, a strong showing in Alberta helped to counter declines in other areas", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/housing-starts-miss-forecasts-for-3rd-straight-month-in-canada", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/alberta-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2020 11:12 AM EST", "content": "Canadian housing starts declined in the final month of 2019, led lower by multiple-unit construction.Builders began work on an annualized 197,300 units in December, down 3.4 per cent from a revised 204,300 in the prior month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said in a statement Thursday.

Only 33 per cent said a recession is unlikely, with 12 per cent unsure.While the public\u2019s concerns are at odds with economist projections for at least some modest growth in 2020, the downbeat perceptions reflect a pervasive sense of caution that has dogged the country\u2019s households for more than a year and impacted their behaviour. \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nTories\u2019 \u2018made-in-Canada\u2019 recession narrative is only resonating because the Liberals have a lousy script\nSaddled with some of the highest household debt levels in the world, Canadians have already slowed their spending to the weakest in at least half a century, in part because they are saving more to brace for a potential hit. That\u2019s bad news for an economy that\u2019s been relying heavily on the consumer to drive growth, given the country\u2019s weak investment and export record over the past decade.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cCanada\u2019s expansion will be lacklustre in 2020, with drags from debt-laden consumers, global trade risks and lingering business uncertainty. The open economy is not immune to slower growth in the U.S. or broader global manufacturing malaise. A solid labour market and incremental policy stimulus should prevent a slowdown from turning into something worse.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Husby, Bloomberg Economics.Excluding housing, annual growth in total household consumption \u2014 everything from the purchase of televisions to spending on health care \u2014 has averaged 1.1 per cent in real terms over the past four quarters, the slowest pace outside recession since at least 1962. Another sign of cautiousness: savings rates are inching higher and are now at the highest since 2015.Talk of a global recession in financial markets had been rife for much of last year, but those worries have faded significantly in recent weeks amid signs the global economy is stabilizing \u2014 helped by receding trade war risks between China and the U.S. and looser monetary policy in much of the world. At the same time, whatever growth there is will be modest.Economists predict Canada\u2019s economy will expand by a tepid 1.6 per cent this year, about the same as 2019. The U.S. economy is seen slowing to 1.8 per cent growth from 2.3 per cent in 2019.There are also indications that consumer worries have levelled off. The results are little changed from a similar poll taken at the end of November. A separate gauge of consumer confidence \u2014 the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index \u2014 saw a rebound in December from a two-month slide, as financial markets surged at the end of last year and sentiment around real estate recovered.Recession concerns are most pronounced in prairie provinces like Alberta, where almost three-quarters of households see a chance of a 2020 contraction. A majority of respondents in British Columbia and Ontario are also concerned a downturn is imminent. Quebec was the only province where optimists outnumbered pessimists.The results of the current survey are based on a hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,010 Canadians, between Dec. 22 and Dec. 29, and have a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.

Along with declining birthrates, that helped slow annual population growth to the weakest in a century, according to an analysis by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.Last year, Canada added a net 437,000 people from abroad, despite being only a tenth the size of the U.S., helping to drive its fastest population increase in 30 years, even with declines in fertility. \nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nAll the reasons why Canada needs immigration \u2014 and more of it\nThe data show the two countries are relying on different drivers to counter the global trend of aging demographics. While Canada has turned to robust immigration to grow output, the U.S. has done a better job of tapping its domestic workforce and generating productivity gains.Which development model will prevail in 2020 remains to be seen. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News are giving the U.S. an edge, with growth projected at 1.8 per cent, versus 1.6 per cent in Canada. Both forecasts are much higher than the other five G7 countries, which are seen growing by an average 0.7 per cent.The boost from immigration, however, prompted one bank to predict Canada will leapfrog the U.S.Flattered by robust population increases of 1.5 per cent year-over-year, Canada\u2019s headline growth could \u201ceasily\u201d top the U.S. this year, \u201cespecially with some certainty on the USMCA, at long last,\u201d Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter said in a note, referring to the new North American trade deal.A Bright SpotCanada\u2019s immigration-driven population boom has been one of the few bright spots for the economy, credited with supporting the labor force and the housing market. Without the population increases, the country would be tracking much slower growth given productivity gains have remained weak for years. Canada\u2019s labor productivity is up 0.6 per cent from a year ago, versus 1.5 per cent in the U.S.Since 2015, the number of annual newcomers to Canada has more than doubled \u2014 the opposite of what\u2019s happening in the U.S., where net international migration has dropped by almost half. Last year, the U.S. grew its population by 0.5 per cent \u2014 just one-third of Canada\u2019s pace.Reasons behind the downward trajectory in the U.S. include fewer foreigners moving into the country, more foreigners leaving, and changes in Puerto Rican migration, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.More restrictive immigration policies from the Trump administration have also curbed interest from foreign students and workers, benefiting its neighbour to the north.Bloomberg.com"}]
