It can be done Fast & Safely!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020Musk, 48, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at its plant in Fremont, California, flouting county officials who ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He openly acknowledged he was taking the chance he or his staff may be apprehended, though he wrote in a Twitter post: Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020Health officers for Alameda County and six other San Francisco Bay area municipalities decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May. While Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities could keep stricter measures in place.Overnight, Musk sent an email to employees: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.

Elon Musk unleashes tweet storm, threatening to pull Tesla out of California over ‘absurd and medically irrational’ shutdown
When asked on Twitter how Monday went at the factory, Musk replied Tuesday: “Great.” Tesla’s shares rose as much as 3.9 per cent as of 11:50 a.m. in New York trading. The stock price has doubled this year.Two workers who have returned to work at the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.Musk’s emailed words of encouragement followed tweets in which he claimed Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas and may even cease manufacturing in California. To follow through on those threats, the CEO would have to uproot many of the roughly 20,000 employees the carmaker has in the San Francisco Bay area. About half of the company’s headcount is at the factory.He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk is waging another legal battle. This time, he’s tangling with health officials over measures to contain a virus that he downplayed starting in January.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Alameda County issued a statement Monday saying Tesla’s Fremont plant was operating beyond what was allowed and that it hoped the company would “comply without further enforcement measures.” The county has been in an ongoing dialogue over employee health-screening procedures and said it will continue to review Tesla’s plans.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen. The nation’s top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, warned against reopening the economy too soon during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying that doing so risks new coronavirus outbreaks throughout the U.S.Trump’s supportive Twitter post followed words of encouragement that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offered to Musk on Monday.“He’s one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “California should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely.”Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director and Elon’s brother, shared a story on Mnuchin’s remarks with his more than 107,000 followers. “Only California and @GavinNewsom⁩ could make me a Trump fan,” he wrote.Bloomberg.com"

The two dancers on Celebrity Cruises’s Infinity say being held aboard ships for almost two months has left them emotionally drained.“I cried all day,” said Carrick, 29. “We need to have alcohol to sleep — that’s how bad it is. We’re worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home.”Carrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shook the industry and underscored concern about mental health.

The ship set sail from Miami with 900 crew members and no passengers and has been wandering the seas since then.

“It’s a very stressful situation,” said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which represents local unions. “The prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points.”Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship’s crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to Covid-19, the company said. Carnival, the world’s largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker’s family.

‘If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me’: Elon Musk says Tesla will defy California county and reopen car plant
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 line and owner of Celebrity Cruises, said a crew member went overboard from its Jewel of the Seas about two weeks ago.‘Suicidal’ MessagesCrew members have said the reported deaths have rattled them and dampened morale, said Krista Thomas, a former Norwegian Cruise Line guest manager who’s operating two Facebook pages for stranded crew and their families. In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.“Many of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they’re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,” said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. “Many have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.”The cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.“That one simple question – how do we get you home? – turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,” Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. “Each country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions – and they frequently change without notice.”About 15 countries won’t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.

About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.CDC RequirementsThe business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.“This whole experience has been a nightmare,” said Carrick. “I can’t even think of coming back to a ship.”Bloomberg.com"

To stem the spread of Covid-19, it will implement temperature checks, require masks and prohibit lines for toilets, with lavatories made available on request.The carrier’s push to get planes back in the air clashes with comments from U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said Britons were unlikely to be vacationing abroad this summer. O’Leary said practical measures to resume travel should be worked out over the next several weeks.“By the time we get to the first of July, we think masks and temperature checks will become the norm in train stations, on board trains and undergrounds, on buses, in public transport across Europe,” O’Leary said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday. “It would be a reasonably modest extension to add those to airport terminals and on board aircraft.”Ryanair gained as much as 3.8 per cent in Dublin trading. The stock has tumbled 38 per cent this year.‘Unenforcable’ QuarantineTrouble is, within the European Union, each nation sets its own rules on entry. Britain, which just left the bloc but remains a major hub for flights in the region, plans a two-week quarantine on incoming travellers that executives have decried as tantamount to a ban.“The U.K. 14-day isolation is nonsense,” O’Leary said. “There’s no scientific basis for it whatsoever.”While the European Commission is preparing recommendations for removing border controls, the Ryanair tussle highlights the conflicting priorities that could make the resumption of air travel a bumpy one.Lavish Holidays UnlikelyO’Leary said the airline has seen a surge in bookings since announcing its resumption of service early Tuesday, adding that there’s pent-up demand, especially from families, who want to take their typical two-week summer vacations abroad. That’s after Hancock told ITV it’s “unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible this summer.”Spain’s tourism industry, a key driver of the economy, was also dealt a potential blow when the government decreed this week that all people arriving from abroad will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in “their homes or lodgings.” The measure will stay in force until the current state of emergency is lifted.Ryanair said it would restart flights from most of its bases, and will offer seats starting from 20 euros (US$21.60) one-way. Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.Coordination PlansThe U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.“What it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. “The problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.”The EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a “tourism package” of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers. The EU’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, told lawmakers last week that digital contact-tracing apps might “enable at least some traveling during the summer.”Bloomberg.com"

In 2019, Lindsay’s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck’s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company’s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen.

“At our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck’s shareholders for the company’s strategy,” Brown said by phone.Impala’s letter alleges four projects — the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada’s oilsands — have destroyed over $12 billion in value.“It’s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,” Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. “The company’s paying top dollar for underperformance.”It's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsBob Bishop 
 
Impala’s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay’s strategy as lacking “clear direction or coherence,” and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.

As for Teck’s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: “We have been very clear that if we can’t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.”Impala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.“The dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,” Bishop said. Instead, “it has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.”Chair MeetingIn March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck’s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. “These have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we’re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.”Bishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck’s zinc and copper assets. He also said he’s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.“If they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,” he said.Tribeca DemandsTribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck’s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.“If you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,” he said. “The shareholding structure is probably in the ‘undeliverable’ so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.”Bloomberg.com"

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise.Wall Street’s three major averages closed around their session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 457.21 points, or 1.89 per cent, to 23,764.78, the S&P 500 lost 60.2 points, or 2.05 per cent, to 2,870.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 189.79 points, or 2.06 per cent, to 9,002.55. The TSX was down 222 points at 14,881.The disastrous fallout of business closures and stay-at-home orders caused an unprecedented 20.5 million job losses in April, tripling the unemployment rate to 14.7 per cent, the highest since the Great Depression era of the 1930s. A key measure of U.S. consumer prices declined last month by the most on record. A sustained trend of declining prices would spur worries about deflation, exacerbating concern that the recovery from the deep economic downturn will be very slow.Buyers of U.S. stocks after the economy shrank in the first quarter have history on their side, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth Management. Gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, marking the 13th quarterly decline of more than 4 per cent since 1949, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Newsom, who allowed manufacturing in parts of the state to restart May 8, said Monday that the county decided to enforce stricter rules around reopening.When asked about Tesla reopening its Fremont plant regardless of Alameda’s order, Newsom said he was unaware.“It was my understanding when I walked up to the podium today that that wasn’t the case,” he said.Alameda’s public health department declined to comment.Musk, 48, tweeted over the weekend that Alameda’s refusal to let Tesla reopen the Fremont factory was “the final straw” and that he’d immediately move Tesla’s headquarters to Nevada or Texas.Newsom said Monday the state has a strong relationship with Tesla, calling it “a company that this state has substantively supported for now many, many years.” Musk then thanked the governor in a tweet.Bloomberg.com"

But Chesapeake’s success at extracting the fuel from deeply buried rock contributed to a massive gas glut. While the company has pushed to transition into an oil explorer, that move could prove pointless after crude’s historic crash.The company first warned in November that it may not survive as a going concern. Shares fell 3.4 per cent to US$14.20 in pre-market trading in New York.Chesapeake said in the federal filing that by delaying and shutting in wells, the company is cutting oil output by 50 per cent this month and by 37 pre cent in June. The company also cut 13 per cent of its workforce in April.Bloomberg.com"

Amazon doesn’t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday. AMC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The trade publication Deadline reported Monday morning that “there are no talks,” citing unidentified sources.

AMC shares rose as much as US$2.31 to US$6.41 in New York trading. They were up as little as 19 per cent minutes after the Deadline report and were up 36 per cent to US$5.58 at 11:28 a.m. The stock was down 43 per cent this year through last week, battered along with the rest of the cinema industry by a worldwide shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.AMC’s bonds surged on reports of the talks with Amazon, and were among the top gainers in the U.S. high-yield market on Monday, according to Trace bond-trading data. AMC’s senior subordinated bonds due 2026 were up as much as 10 cents on the dollar to 32 cents, data shows.The reported talks are unlikely to spark a price war for AMC, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst Amine Bensaid said in a note. “Movie-going is unlikely to fully bounce back in a post-COVID-19 world and may create risks for an acquirer,” he said. “AMC’s elevated debt load and unavoidable fixed costs mean the company’s near-term financial flexibility will be severely challenged.”AMC showed its concern about existential threats with its reaction to last month’s straight-to-streaming release of the kids movie “Trolls World Tour,” which Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures crowed about as a high-grossing success. AMC said it would no longer show Universal’s movies.Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, who spent billions of dollars building one of the world’s biggest cinema operators, controls AMC through his closely held Wanda Group. Wanda acquired AMC in 2012 for US$2.6 billion as part of its expansion into entertainment. It subsequently acquired Nordic, Carmike and Odeon & UCI Cinemas.Along with its vast retail and web-services operations, Amazon is an active player in streaming with its Prime Video platform, along with releasing original films. Like Netflix Inc., Amazon is eager to shore up its burgeoning position in Hollywood as new and old players scrap for content deals. Buying a theatre chain would guarantee another outlet for its movies.Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley FBR, wrote to clients Monday that a cash offer for AMC, which is on track for its fourth straight year of stock declines, wouldn’t appeal to investors.

A halving happens about every four years and slows down the rate at which new tokens are created — an intentional feature designed to control inflation. Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen into the event and jumped after, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies averaged 446 days.Here’s a QuickTake on what Bitcoin’s “halving” means.“So far, Bitcoin’s third halving looks different to prior events and there doesn’t appear to have been such a sustained price run-up,” said Payal Lakhani, director of equity research and product development at CME Group, in a blog post Friday. “Given the reward change has been known since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, and having already seen two such events, investors may have already incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.”The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in lower volumes as some participants focused on non-crypto markets, and some mining operations being affected by these difficult market conditions, Lakhani said.Bloomberg.com"

Disney is struggling to recoup earnings at its theme park and film businesses pummelled by the virus crisis, while China’s government is grappling with the challenges of incrementally reopening the country. Parks, factories and restaurants in cities and countries around the world are reopening under rules to keep customers and workers apart amid the threat of second waves and flare-ups of the virus.To reach the gates of Shanghai Disneyland, guests had to pass through body temperature checks and show that their health status has been confirmed using a smartphone app for tracking infected persons. Masks were mandatory, despite the muggy 23 degree Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) weather.

The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction, for example, had a maximum of five minutes standing in line mid-morning, according to an app that tracks waits at the park. The longest line for a ride at the time was 20 minutes, according to the app.

In the afternoon, some lines started to stretch to 30 minutes, maximum.On a typical spring day under normal conditions, visitors might wait more than one hour for the most popular attractions.The Disney World shop, which sells toys and T-shirts, required use of hand sanitizer to enter, and had few shoppers. Popcorn and chicken wing stands were open, though fewer than on a normal day.Live theatre shows, areas where children would come into close contact, such as water play spots, and parades have been suspended during the initial reopening to avoid raising infection risks.“The real test will come as those capacity limits are eased and the calendar moves into what is typically the critical peak summer season,” said Ron Merriman, managing director of theme park consultants MR ProFun China. “But I am very optimistic about the park’s prospects for passing that test.”

Shanghai Disneyland was the first of the entertainment giant’s parks to close on Jan. 25 as the coronavirus began to spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, 520 miles (840 kilometres) west of the country’s business capital.Disney blamed the pandemic for lopping US$1.4 billion off profit last quarter, largely by forcing it to shut resorts around the world. While Disney is keeping its U.S., Hong Kong and Paris parks closed, the company said last week it would open a limited number of shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs mall outside its resorts in Orlando, Florida, on May 20.Tickets to Shanghai Disneyland during the initial reopening phase are 399 yuan (US$56) for regular days, and 499 yuan for weekends.Disney’s theme parks division contributed about 46 per cent of operating income in the 12 months ended September 2019, more than double the earnings from its studio entertainment business, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Bloomberg.com"

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.“We began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,” Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure’s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. “We would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.”Brookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn’t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield’s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia’s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure’s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.“Our outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,” Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a ‘swoosh’ shape than ‘U’ or a ‘V’ with the aid of government stimulus. He said he expects most sectors and businesses to return to a more normal environment by the end of 2020 or first half of 2021, assuming there is not significant second wave of the virus.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The last company to surpass Royal Bank’s market capitalization was drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in July 2015.

Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. — the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. — crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.’s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada’s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck. The telecommunications-equipment maker ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was liquidated.

The dramatic collapse of two Canadian tech giants in a country more known for being hewers of wood and drawers of water has hung over the country’s corporate psyche for years. So Shopify’s rise has been cheered on by many.“I think it’s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,” said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify “should be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it’s tech sector because it’s been remarkable what they’ve done,” he said. Jackson had owned the company’s stock but doesn’t currently have a position. Its U.S.-listed shares have risen by 43 times since the initial public offering at US$17 in 2015.Too Fast?This year’s rally, which has seen the stock double, has drawn its doubters.“On just about any valuation metric, this is one of the most expensive stocks in Techland,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco told clients in a note Wednesday. Shopify also holds the highest sales multiple, though has the largest sales growth outlook, RBC added. The bank rates Shopify with the equivalent of a buy.The rally has made founder and chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, Canada’s fourth-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 39-year-old has added US$2.8 billion to his wealth this year, and is now worth US$6.3 billion. The billionaire has about 7 per cent of Shopify, according to its 2019 proxy circular.

Lutke, a German immigrant with vivid blue eyes and a penchant for tweed caps, began building software to launch an online snowboard store in 2004. It became obvious that the software was more valuable than the snowboards, according to his website profile, and he went on to launch the Shopify platform in 2006. RBC was incorporated in 1869.Shopify sells tools to help companies set up an online store, a business model seen flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic that has shuttered bricks and mortar stores. In April, the company’s chief technology officer tweeted Shopify was handling “Black Friday-level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Amazon ComparisonAt Bloomberg’s Sooner Than You Think conference in New York last year, Lutke said Shopify isn’t competing with Amazon.com Inc. but helping other people do so.“They’ve obviously become the anti-Amazon, they’re all about empowering everybody else except Amazon on the online e-commerce world to be successful and they’ve expanded and expanded their suite of services,” Jackson said.He believes Shopify has the opportunity to keep rising and have a market value of several hundred billion dollars in the years ahead.“They are still just getting going. People who complain they are ‘too expensive’ don’t understand how much revenue and profits they’ll drive in the years ahead,” Jackson said.Bloomberg.com"

The regulator must work with the CME to determine whether the price moves were a one-time occurrence or a reflection of dynamics in the contract that could recur, Berkovitz said in a statement.A rapid plunge in the final minutes of trading on April 20 that pushed prices to below zero thrust one of the world’s most-traded futures into the spotlight. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said the agency is “conducting a deep dive” to understand the move, but that the negative prices appeared to have been a result of supply and demand related to storage capacity and the global economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.“The WTI contract is a key benchmark in the energy and financial markets,” Berkovitz said in his statement, which was prepared for a meeting of a CFTC advisory committee that he leads. “A futures contract that is disconnected from the physical market cannot serve as a means to discover prices or manage price risks arising from the use of the commodity.”Berkovitz said he’s concerned that many of the same dynamics that drove the move in the May contract haven’t been resolved. The WTI June contract, the next futures to come due, expires on May 19.“There is a high probability that the supply, demand and storage conditions that were present during trading in the May spot month will persist through the upcoming weeks and into the spot month for the June WTI futures contract,” Berkovitz said.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

A representative for Midland, Michigan-based Dow declined comment.The potential divestitures echo moves across the industry to focus on manufacturing chemicals efficiently while hiving off responsibility for running the ground infrastructure, from power supplies to transportation. Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets last year paid Bayer AG and Lanxess AG more than $3.5 billion to take over their chemical park operations, gaining a steady income from long-term service and supply contracts with the companies on site.Dow’s marine and storage operations, known as its Mars unit, includes 136 chemical and liquid hyrdocarbon tanks with 200 million gallons (760 million liters) of capacity, as well as 11 marine docks, according to one of the people. The terminals — including ones in Freeport, Texas, and St. Charles and Plaquemine in Louisiana — are located near railway lines operated by Union Pacific Corp. Open land and unused tank capacity may also be included in a transaction, the person said.More than 70% of Mars revenue last year came from Dow, and the company would seek a 25-year contract with the buyer for marine and terminal services, one of the people said. The business also has third-party customers, most which have a minimum of 15 years remaining on their leases.For the potential rail divestiture, Dow wants a similar long-term partner for infrastructure critical to its manufacturing operations at six sites in North America, another person briefed on the matter said. The plants in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; and in Alberta, Canada, at Calgary and Edmonton, represent the bulk of Dow’s olefins and polyethlene production capacity.Dow has accounted for more than 75% of its rail business’s revenue, which had a compound annual growth rate of about 7% over the last three years, the person said. The company has offered to sign a 25-year agreement with potential suitors. Other existing contracts have roughly 12 years remaining, on average.The company, led by Chief Executive Officer James Fitterling, has seen its stock tumble 42% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 12% drop for the S&P 500 Index.

A separate proposal, which was coordinated by the investor activist group ShareAction and backed by money managers at Amundi SA and Jupiter Asset Management, called for the phase-out of financing activities to the most carbon-intensive energy companies. It received 23.95% support.The vote could go down as a milestone event because it’s the first climate change resolution at a European bank, and demonstrates how banks’ contribution to global warming remains a top priority for investors. It also showed how shareholders can force banks and other large corporations to use their vast resources to combat climate change and other social ills.“Today’s result shows the value of shareholder engagement with banks on climate change,” said Faith Ward, the Bristol-based chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership. “This resolution came about as a direct result of intensive shareholder engagement over the past year, including the first-ever shareholder climate resolution at a major European bank.”While Brunel was among firms that filed the shareholder resolution and had hoped to see both proposals pass, Ward said the shareholder resolution got more than 20% support, which means it surpassed a threshold that requires Barclays to consult with shareholders and explain the views received and actions taken publicly within six months.The shareholder resolution was put forward in January and urged Barclays to say how it will phase out financing for energy companies that don’t align with the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. As a growing number of investors pledged to support the resolution, Barclays in March put forward its own net- zero alternative, which ShareAction criticized for leaving unanswered questions about the bank’s financing activities in the short term.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said today’s votes send “an unequivocal signal not just to the board of Barclays but to the entire global banking sector that all banks must start to phase out” fossil-fuel financing.“Today’s voting results will send shock waves through the banking industry,” Howarth said. “While Barclays is Europe’s largest fossil-fuel financier, it is far from being the only bank to prop up companies that are driving the climate crisis.”Barclays provided more than 100 billion pounds ($123 billion) of funds to fossil-fuel companies since the Paris climate accord was signed, according to data compiled by Rainforest Action Network, which includes information gathered from Bloomberg.For some, London-based Barclays hasn’t gone far enough to change its trajectory.“Rather than backing a resolution that set out a clear pathway for Barclays to finally end its vast contribution to the climate emergency, the bank chose to hoodwink both shareholders and the public with an alternative option — one with distant targets and no substance,”said Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace U.K.’s head of climate finance. “There is nothing wrong with a net-zero target but, without details of how it will get there, Barclays’s ambition is all show and no go.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Martel, who used to head the business jets division before leaving Bombardier for a few years to head Canada’s biggest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, said he hasn’t seen many order cancellations so far. That’s a contrast with December 2014, when cancellations started piling up after oil prices collapsed, he said.“It is moving at a slow pace, there’s no decision being made,” Martel said, adding that customers have asked for information on plane availability and timing as they assess the duration and impact of the pandemic. “We think that when we have more visibility on the pandemic that the activity level will be restarting.”Bigger JetsDemand for bigger private jets seems more solid than for smaller aircraft, Martel said.The Montreal-based company, which suspended its financial forecast in March, said it would offer updated projections when it has greater visibility on the pandemic’s impact.“We have limited exposure today on the light jet versus either 2008 or even 2014,” he said. “We always felt going into those crises that the large-segment market was much more robust. And today, as you know, we are much more dependent on that segment, which makes me believe that our backlog will remain much more solid.”Bloomberg.com"

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.“It will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men’s jobs affected,” according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers — where many women work — is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a “she-cession,” April’s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Construction in CrosshairsBrendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday’s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn’t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. “The hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,” Bernard said by phone.While Friday’s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it’s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University’s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.“That’s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,” Moffatt said. “The job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.”Path to RecoveryThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won’t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.“Once things start to return to normal, it’s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,” Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.“We are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,” Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"

The internet is glutted with second-by-second countdown clocks and the mania is even spurring a hike in hiring by crypto firms worldwide.

Bitcoin breaks through $10,000 level with traders setting their sights on $11,000
Bitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin’s undergone two prior halvings — or halvenings, as they’re sometimes called — which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world’s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017’s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days — should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there’s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin’s halving, he wrote in a recent note.Price PredictionsTo be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor’s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn’t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.“It is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,” Pal wrote in a recent presentation. “It was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.”Jefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly “Greed & Fear” newsletter recommended investors — including institutions — buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token’s prior price surges around the event.“To invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,” he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification “precisely because of its truly decentralized nature,” he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeAntoni Trenchev 
 
Venture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. “Bitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,” he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels. Though the halving may already be priced in, it will lead to huge appreciation over time, he said.“Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it’s by far the best performing asset of the past decade,” he said. “We’re bullish about its future.”Trenchev is seeing “huge” demand for his firm’s products ahead of the coin’s halving. “We’re not hiring because of the halving per se. We’re hiring because the halving has been lifting Bitcoin and will continue to do so,” he said.Hiring HikeA number of crypto exchanges have also embarked on hiring sprees. Kraken LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. are expanding their workforces, as are OkEx and Coinbase Inc.David Janczewski, the chief executive officer and founder of Cardiff, Wales-based Coincover, said any market event that impacts adoption is a positive for his business.“That’s part of what we see — when the last spike happened, we know that an awful lot of people moved into the market because they felt they ought to get in on the action,” said Janczewski, whose firm offers insurance against crypto thefts and scams. “Ultimately, anything that causes the market to be aware, or wider investment markets to be aware of crypto, tends to be a good thing from our perspective.”Bloomberg.com"

Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more “difficult adjustments” would be put forth in the next two weeks. “Days like this are brutal,” he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a “last wave” in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber’s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees. If the case is successful, the companies could be on the hook for substantial new costs that further jeopardize their business models.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

HSBC said that the gold market “became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,” contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to “market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.” It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC’s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium. The precious metal surged more than 30% in the first three weeks of January, before tumbling at the end of the month.Read More: HSBC, BNP Repeatedly Breached Trading Limits in Market ChaosHSBC is not alone in its recent struggles with precious metals.

As governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he’s pivoting to “phase two” of the nation’s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.

Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said. “But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”On his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as “warriors” as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.

Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”And while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.“There’ll be more death,” he said. “The virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal.”“But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it,” Trump said. “I think our economy is going to be raging” next year, he added.No Face MaskWhile in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done “safely.”Yet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and Guns N’ Roses’s version of “Live and Let Die.”Senior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn’t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that “doctors” he didn’t name had advised him to close the economy “for a couple of years.”“I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we’ve ever had,” Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. “And then one day they said, ‘we have to close our country.’ Well, now it’s time to open up.”Public-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.Models ‘So Wrong’But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a “fire” that could be extinguished “fast.”He also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriorsDonald Trump 
 
“These models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They’ve been so wrong, they’ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they’re wrong,” the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on “faulty assumptions” about mitigation efforts and didn’t represent federal government projections.“The people of our country are warriors,” Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are “somewhat” or “very” worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.“Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And we’ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,” Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: “No.”Bloomberg.com"

From buying bonds to paying wages, authorities are playing a role in the economy that was unimaginable even a few months ago.To be clear, it’s not like they had much choice. The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market — whether it’s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies — the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come. Cutting and running too soon risks stripping away a vital safety net that both companies and workers may still need. Staying too long risks crowding out private players.Big government may be back, but how long it’s welcome is another story.Global HeadlinesPhase two | President Donald Trump fixed his course on reopening the nation for business, acknowledging that the move would cause more illness and death from the pandemic but insisting it’s a cost he’s willing to pay to get the economy back on track. Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China’s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a “decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the “blame game,” saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. “It’s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,” he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.’s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country’s exit from lockdown. With Europe’s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country’s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled. Trump supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members and sent him a message describing the initiative as a “good idea,” the American ambassador to Moscow told the Interfax news service. Russian mercenaries are engaged in a large-scale effort in Libya to bolster eastern commander Khalifa Haftar providing technical support, direct involvement in combat operations and sophisticated influence campaigns, according to United Nations experts. Ivory Coast arrested 14 soldiers and five civilians on allegations of planning a coup linked to presidential hopeful Guillaume Soro, who was sentenced in absentia last week on charges of embezzlement and money laundering.Tell us how we’re doing or what we’re missing at balancepower@bloomberg.net.And finally … Long a target of the Philippines’ outspoken president, Rodrigo Duterte, the country’s largest media company was ordered to close overnight after its franchise expired.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) — Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a third in six weeks while much of the commodities universe melts down. Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of pandemic-related mine closures, are adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand softened by industrial lockdowns. There will be no swift return to lofty levels last seen over a decade ago, but the metal may still be the only one to end the year with a record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged by a factor of 13 between 2003 and 2007. That hastened a production splurge that put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce more at depressed prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada’s Cameco has suspended production at its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan. Kazakhstan’s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It’s true that almost all metals have seen a blow to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that’s dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers, whose own factories have been shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34 per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others have climbed, too: London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF have recovered from their 2020 nadirs.The real question is what happens next. Even $34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A significant proportion of producers still don’t make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities are sitting on a still-substantial four years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit will keep upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners is close to $55, though existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even an approval today won’t ease the squeeze fast: A new uranium operation takes years.Then there’s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as traditional users find their reactors are aging, and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher: The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide emissions almost equivalent to two years of those related to global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a renewed preoccupation with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses when it comes to a metal that isn’t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling, too. For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

He promised employees that the McLean, Virginia-based firm will give them at least six weeks’ notice once it decides to reopen those sites.That’s one of the strongest signs yet that legions of industry employees using makeshift work stations at home may have to wait much longer to return to their offices, even as many states begin lifting restrictions on public life. Capital One, which earns most of its revenue from its massive credit card business, said in late March that it had more than 40,000 people doing their jobs remotely online — accounting for more than three-quarters of its workforce.Many major financial firms have yet to publicly set dates for reopening offices as they grapple with numerous challenges, such as how to help employees safely commute, ascend elevators and navigate shared workspaces. And those that have weighed in on the topic have expressed caution. At Citigroup Inc., for example, President Jane Fraser said last month that the firm will conduct its own analyses of risks and won’t necessarily reopen offices just because local authorities issue all-clears.Capital One has spent years investing in technology and was among the first U.S. banks to announce it would transition to cloud computing. Those moves have helped the firm operate more effectively during this crisis, Fairbank said in the memo.Decisions to return will vary by location, dependent on local conditions, he said. Meanwhile, most of the lender’s branches have remained open, serving customers with drive-thru or from behind glass.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

She said the lender expects that 30 per cent to 80 per cent of employees may continue to work from home at least some of the time. The Toronto-based bank employed about 45,000 people as of Jan. 31.“We’ve been able to maintain continuity of banking services with far more people working outside the office than we ever thought possible,” Malone said Monday in an interview. “We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we’ve proven through this is that’s actually not the case.”

Chief Executive Officer Darryl White has said “a 2.0 version” of the workplace may include the blended home-and-office arrangements, as big employers worldwide reconfigure offices and routines. Malone said Canadian and U.S. branch employees have “by and large” been going into work during the crisis along with a “small amount” of technology and operations employees, while 95 per cent of those in office towers have been working from home.About two-thirds of the firm’s employees are in Canada, while 13,408 are in the U.S. and 1,578 overseas. The post-COVID plan involves more workers at home including “a ton” of employees with hybrid office-and-home roles, and fewer people working solely at company locations, Malone said.“It’s a blended approach of thinking about productivity and flexibility and for us not a return to the way it used to be,” she said. “It’s about an evolution in the way that we work.”We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we've proven through this is that's actually not the caseMona Malone 
 
As with many companies worldwide, COVID-19 has already upended much of the workforce of Canada’s fourth-largest bank. For example, call-centre agents initially went into offices at the start of the outbreak. Then in the past month, the bank shifted half of its Canadian call-centre staff and 80 per cent of its U.S. agents to home offices.“That’s not a temporary thing,” Malone said. “We don’t have to think about contact centres as just these geographical hubs, and we can use this remote way of working.”The work-from-anywhere trend helps keep employees safe, Malone said. Crowding workers into office towers while dealing with mass transit, elevators and social distancing is “problematic.” She added that the new approach can also present recruitment possibilities.“It allows us to look for new talent in locations where maybe we haven’t before, and tap into talent pools across the country,” she said.The bank has already seen unexpected benefits in deal-making, as investment bankers use time once spent on commuting to communicate with clients. One investment banker in New York expressed surprise that “doing pitches virtually” has been a success, Malone said.“It’s causing this person who’s 25 years an investment banker to rethink what’s possible,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Residents of Quebec, the French-speaking province with the highest number of cases in Canada, are much more likely to say their spending will decline once the economy reopens, with 41 per cent anticipating a drop in purchases.

Shockproofing Canada: Here’s what it will take to reopen the economy
Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.Hospitals ‘Very Tight’The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsQuebec Premier Francois Legault 
 
Meanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com"

That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It’s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it’s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services.Labor market destruction isn’t unique to Canada.

It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Small groups of workers at facilities around the U.S. have walked off the job in protest, and an employee activist group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, called for corporate employees to call in sick after two of its members were fired.Amazon has said the workers were fired for violating corporate policy forbidding them from speaking publicly about internal matters.

 He said he believed both that Amazon was making massive investments to keep workers safe during the pandemic, and that workers who have spoken out have legitimate concerns. In the essay, Bray said the company was treating warehouse workers like “fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.” He chalked up some of what he sees as Amazon’s failings to its success in a capitalist system not set up incentivize good treatment of workers.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward, Bray wrote.Don’t say it can’t be done, because France is doing it.”“Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets,” Bray wrote. “It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”Bray, whose last day was Friday, said that Amazon Web Services, the division he worked for, treated workers humanely and “is by and large an ethical organization.”Bloomberg.com"

Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year’s event will likely lack “the celebratory feel that it had in the past.”There’s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown. In one of Buffett’s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a “big one-two punch.”His Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse.

OccidentalBuffett’s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental’s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire’s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW’s Shields.“I certainly don’t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, ‘Hey, this is expensive, but it’s got this great ringing endorsement,’ because that’s not how it’s working out,” Shields said.Berkshire’s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Insurance ClaimsChubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers’ compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire’s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers’ compensation insurance.“It’s so different based on the insurance product line,” Shields said. “There are some lines that have major questions,” especially with business-interruption coverage.Succession QuestionsBuffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire’s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire’s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year’s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year’s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.“It’s really, really important,” Shields said. While there’s no indication that any change would happen now, “at some point in time, it’s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it’s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.”Pandemic FalloutCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See’s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF’s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn’t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire’s breadth — with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations — gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.“Buffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,” Cook said.Bloomberg.com"

The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board.

“There’s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,” said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn’t received the letter. “I can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,” Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.

“The Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck’s management,” Sheila Murray, Teck’s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.Stock PlungeThe activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company’s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because “enough is enough,” Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca’s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world’s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn’t working with other investors. Teck’s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Management MovesLast year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn’t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck’s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.“There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,” the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years 
 
Teck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada’s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.“I don’t see this as a ‘Keevils or nothing’ issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,” Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.ESG PushThe hedge fund’s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn’t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund’s investments are in oil transportation and service providers.

This is not democratic, this is not freedom,” the chief executive officer said after reporting Tesla’s first-ever profit to start a year. “Give people back their goddamn freedom.”Tesla is worried about being able to resume production in the San Francisco Bay area, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May. The Model 3 maker’s only assembly plant in the U.S. still produces the majority of the company’s cars and has been idle since March 23.Investors shrugged off the outburst, with Tesla shares finishing the late trading session up 8.7 per cent. The company’s third straight quarterly profit and revenue of almost US$6 billion both beat analysts’ estimates, extending an advance for a stock that’s already the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year.

Elon Musk and Tesla bulls are so over this COVID-19 panic
“It was vintage Elon. I wish he hadn’t done it,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “But most investors don’t care. It doesn’t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.”The stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.“It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,” Tesla said in its quarterly update. “Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.”During the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to “comfortably” exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.“Gross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. “On the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn’t talk about demand at all.”Tesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla’s semi truck again to 2021 — roughly two years later than initially planned — as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.“Tesla investors are looking past the June quarter,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. “The bulls could take this and run.”Bloomberg.com"

Sales rose 15 per cent to US$35 billion. That compares with average Wall Street estimates for US$1.28 a share in profit and US$34 billion in sales, according to Bloomberg data.

As the virus shut down workplaces, the company has seen increasing demand for internet-based Office and conferencing software that keeps employees connected and productive at home. Much of Microsoft’s software is also now sold by subscription, which means customers generally keep paying even amid a slowdown.“Microsoft revenue is less consumer-centric and far more recurring, and when you go to a subscription, you have a pay-for-it-or-lose-it mindset,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C.

U.S. Federal Reserve holds rate, warns of hardship caused by coronavirus: Read the official statement
Officials Wednesday left unchanged their vague guidance on the future path of rates. The statement repeated language from March 15 saying the committee would keep the benchmark target range near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”U.S. stocks held gains after the Fed’s statement while yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged up slightly to 0.62 per cent.Regarding asset purchases, the FOMC used wording similar to last month, saying the buying of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will continue “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.”Time frame extendedWednesday’s statement acknowledged the extent and breadth of the damage being wraught by the ongoing contagion.“The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world,” the committee said. “The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.”It made specific mention of lower oil prices and their role in holding down inflation.Policy makers also began to extend cautiously the time frame within which they see the economic blow from the virus lasting, though they are still offering no precise forecast.Medium Term“The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,” the committee said.The central bank has mounted an unprecedented push to limit the economic harm of the virus, which has plunged the global economy into recession and likely sent U.S. unemployment well above 10% after businesses shuttered to slow the contagion.Government data released earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 4.8 per cent rate in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank’s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed’s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"

The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"

Oanh Ha,Legal jargon on cruise tickets may foil class-action suits,"‘If you print out one of these tickets, it's like 20 pages of gobbledygook. Most people have no idea the limitations they're presented with’",https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/legal-jargon-on-cruise-tickets-may-foil-virus-class-action-suits,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cruise.jpg,"April 29, 2020 5:01 AM EDT","After two passengers on their luxury cruise tested positive for Covid-19 in March, Emilio and Barbara Hernandez were so frantic to get off the ship, they wrote a note to the captain.The Costa Luminosa sailed on with them still onboard, and they ended up with the virus. Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers’ lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits – lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That’s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that’s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.“These claims are enormous – nothing the industry’s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,” said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry’s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn’t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes’ case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an “uphill battle,” Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers’ tickets. “Provided that’s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.”Range of ProtectionsIt’s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.“If you print out one of these tickets, it’s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. “Most people have no idea the limitations they’re presented with.”For example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it’s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines “took immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,” said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. “Importantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes’ tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a “patently unfair” prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged “significant hurdles” for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted “intentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus” for which there’s no vaccine.If the case isn’t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs’ law firms that pursue them do so on a “no win, no fee” basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.Suits’ Allegations“The ship never should have sailed,” Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. “They put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.”He and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship’s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was “not even connected to any flu-like symptoms,” said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator’s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes’ cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship’s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn’t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik’s office said it’s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak “has focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.” She said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival’s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they “may have been exposed.” It was then – two weeks after the voyage began – that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company’s response was reasonable under the circumstances. “This is a generational global event — it’s unprecedented,” he said.Inspections QuestionedBefore the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there’d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers’ experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn’t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes’ lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival’s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean’s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships “typically perform extremely well” during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven’t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. “There are still a lot of ifs” about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.“The industry hasn’t had any calamitous losses – nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,” Klein said.  Bloomberg.com"

Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open. In Canada, Cargill Inc. has idled its beef plant in High River, Alberta, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s processing capacity while JBS SA’s beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, is running at about half capacity.Quebec-based Goodfood Market Corp., which delivers meals on a subscription basis, said it will be substituting its regular boneless chicken for bone-in thighs, legs and drumsticks as the poultry industry shifts away from de-boning to ramp up production.

New Meat SelectionGrocers generally are accepting cuts of meat that require more cutting by their in-house butchers to keep their meat counters as full as possible, said Michael Young, president of Canada Beef.Meat such as sirloin and strip loins that would have typically been sent to restaurants before the pandemic shuttered businesses are now increasingly sold by retailers who are offering them in different sizes to get the price point down, he said. Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called “end cuts” from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks — from the leg of a cow — on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Larger PackagesConsumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill’s protein and salt businesses. While the company’s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.“We know they’re buying cuts that they’ve never bought before,” Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there’s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors’ Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said. A lot more ground meat is typically sold by comparison, which causes an imbalance.“We’re just waiting to see if enough has changed to eat our way out of the problem,” Allen said.Bloomberg.com"

The video is followed by an explanation in English and Spanish. Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world’s largest online retailer. A vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease’s spread within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it’s safe to show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon’s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off — no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon’s efforts echo what’s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic.

Amazon hasn’t said how many of its workers took unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon’s new safety procedures firsthand. Employees who feel they can’t return because they’re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She’s since returned. “I would have stayed home again if they didn’t make the changes they have,” she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is “providing flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” a spokeswoman said in an email. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.” The company said it doesn’t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.

The coronavirus first struck Amazon’s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus’s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company’s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building’s top manager wasn’t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn’t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn’t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it’s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor — ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they’re being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a hallway.

Despite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon’s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. “We have full shifts in all departments, but it’s seasonal workers,” said Jaylen Camp, who works at a facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. “It’s all new people surrounding me daily,” said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week New York’s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing protective gear. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse.         View this post on Instagram           Today's visits by our founder and CEO @JeffBezos to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and @WholeFoods employees.

A post shared by  Amazon (@amazon) on Apr 8, 2020 at 9:05pm PDTSome employees wonder how Amazon will safely accommodate returnees in buildings rearranged to separate workstations and keep people from congregating. Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren’t eligible. An Amazon spokeswoman later said the decision had been reversed.Other employees plan to return to work. One worker at a warehouse in Connecticut, who decided to work part-time as cases spread nearby, said she can’t afford to lose the paycheque. “Everyone thinks it’s just about sick people staying home, but it’s more than that,” she said. “My kids aren’t in school. The unpaid time basically meant that I’ve had a flexible schedule which has allowed me to do what I need to for my girls.”Bloomberg.com"

He didn’t elaborate.

The order, though, will not be limited to Tyson, the person said. It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump’s order sets the stage for a showdown between America’s meat giants, who’ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who’ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products 
 
The White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down. Meat stocks rose on the news.But a union representing plant workers accused the administration of failing to develop meaningful safety requirements that would have helped contain the disruptions.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” said Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.‘Breaking’ Supply ChainTyson Foods extended gains, jumping as much as 5.6 per cent for the biggest intraday advance in three weeks. Hormel Foods Corp. rose 1 per cent, while JBS SA’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.6 per cent.On Sunday, Tyson Foods Chairman John Tyson said in a blog post that the U.S. food supply chain “is breaking,” with millions of pounds of meat set to “disappear” as plants close.Illnesses in the meat-processing industry and shifts in demand after restaurants closed have disrupted the supply chain. Dairy farmers are dumping milk that can’t be sold to processors, broiler operations have been breaking eggs to reduce supplies and some fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields amid labor and distribution disruptions.

Many low-income Americans, meanwhile, have been waiting in long lines at food banks, which have reported shortages.Asked about the country’s food supply, Trump said: “There’s plenty of supply.”The Defense Production Act allows the government broad power to direct industrial production in crises. Trump has previously invoked the law — or threatened to invoke it — in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa’s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities “as soon as it is possible to do so safely.” Iowa produces one-third of the nation’s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Sick WorkersAcross the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with “depopulation and disposal methods” for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African swine fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs.Bloomberg.com"

The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers — a sign of just how distorted the market has become.

The spectre of production shut-downs — and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies — was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It’s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.“We are moving into the end-game,” Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. “Early-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.”In theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it’s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameTorbjorn Tornqvist 
 
The best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.“Monday really focused people’s minds that production needs to slow down,” Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. “It’s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.”Trafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. “The severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,” said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.

North Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state’s total.The output cuts won’t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.“I wouldn’t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,” Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. “In certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.”In emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that’s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it’s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What’s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.

Before the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.Refiners ShutBut before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate.

The fund said it’s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn’t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold “significant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.”

The ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it’s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.“While it is USO’s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,” it said in the filing, adding that USO investors “should expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO’s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.”Easy TargetThe US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn’t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including “a change in regulator accountability levels and position limits” as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that’s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that’s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"

Malls and main-street shops, bastions of community commerce, were already under pressure after two years of weak retail sales, rising property taxes and the shift to e-commerce. Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online — even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That’s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year — a level Sanderson describes as “very tight.”“Many retailers are in trouble,” Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. “I think when we get to the other side of this, there’s a real reckoning to be had.”I think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadRoelof van Dijk 
 
Much will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country’s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country’s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can’t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That’s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.“To be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive — I would guess that some of the ones that won’t survive maybe weren’t in such good shape when this started,” he said in an April 21 interview. “Where we think the tenant should be able to survive, we’re certainly open to discussing further help.”Still he’s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.“Once people feel safe and comfortable — and that may be a full year before we’re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer — I think people will go back to their basic habits,” Sonshine said. “They want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym — all of which nobody can do right now.”Bloomberg.com"

While the second name has yet to emerge in public, BlackRock Inc.’s Jean Boivin is no longer in contention.

Whoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that’s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada’s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank’s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.

“You need someone forceful,” Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “There does have to be some push back.”The outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today’s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons — the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada’s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank’s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that’s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion — a gap that’s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulMark Chandler 
 
With the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada’s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada’s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. “Someday the tensions will ease back and we won’t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,” the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts. It’s one thing for the central bank to finance income support measures, another for it to fund agendas.In the short term, it’s all academic. With the economy in crisis and inflation nowhere in sight, keeping the taps open is the only option.Bloomberg.com"

Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.‘Health Halo’Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.

It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days.

“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”Bloomberg.com"

Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers’ digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu — or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province’s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe’s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon’s dominance.

“People will be able to see what’s available in their region,” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. “There’s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.”Quebec’s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company’s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.“There’s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,” Lecours said. “Still, let’s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it’s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?”Efforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch — including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.’s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV’s beer.

When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer — an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.“An initiative to promote local commerce isn’t an initiative against free trade,” Fitzgibbon said then. “It’s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.”The Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn’t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it’s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the “Buy Quebec” movement to stay.“No one can compete with Amazon,” she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don’t sell on the behemoth’s platform, “we have some exclusivity they don’t have.”‘I Made No Money’Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.’s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling “Black Friday level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault’s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.“I made no money,” he said. Shipping costs “is what’s hurting everyone.”Taillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket’s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers’ attention.“Our goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,” he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, “it will have been worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Brazil, the world’s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.“It’s absolutely unprecedented,” said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. “It’s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.”

New U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin.

The most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.“During this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation’s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,” Smithfield said in a statement Friday. “It’s an awful choice; it’s not one we wish on anyone.”Prices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike’s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.“We’re backing it up already because of the coming — we feel — the coming shortages,” said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven’t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn’t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn’t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there’s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don’t have a place to sell their animals. That’s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It’s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That’s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on “depopulation and disposal methods.”

It’s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling — so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as “elbow-to-elbow.” Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there’s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day — it’s basically the opposite of social distancing.Sick InspectorsAt the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That’s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there’s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS’s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant “are fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.” The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that “employee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.”The closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.“Brazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don’t see progress in agglomeration of people,” said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. “They are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Esteban Duarte,Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces,Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government — which could trigger a downgrade,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg,"April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT","Canada’s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country’s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada’s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada’s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days. 
Shockproofing Canada: Here’s what it will take to reopen the economy
Alberta’s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility
How to help the provinces weather the COVID-19 economic shock
Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.“There is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point” for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.A ‘Weak’ AAACanadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada’s profile as similar to Australia — whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 — and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada’s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.“The fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low — I think that will be very important for the credit rating,” said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada’s top credit rating as “extremely resilient,” citing the central government’s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is “among the weak” AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn’t an automatic trigger for a credit action.Implicit SupportWhile the federal government doesn’t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador’s rating of A1 by Moody’s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of “a high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,” Moody’s said in an April 1 statement. Moody’s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It’s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.“We still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.“Oil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,” said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That’s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.“Provincials are absolutely key for Canada’s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,” said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces’ credit ratings may be “called into question.”Bloomberg.com"

The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems — chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls — after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel’s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"

That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett’s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. “We’ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won’t reopen when this is over,” he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.“There’s no fortress that’s immune to that right now,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book “Margin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.”Some Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See’s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire’s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett’s promise that Berkshire will “forever remain a financial fortress” hasn’t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.“It’s nowhere near business as usual, of course,” he said in an interview. “But keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there’s a coronavirus pandemic.”Schnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he’s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn’t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.’s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire’s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett’s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren’t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this “typhoon,” Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire’s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett’s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett’s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Buffett has yet to announce a similar deal recently, shareholder Thomas Russo said Buffett’s ability to evaluate unique opportunities may help again.“He’s patient,” said Russo, who oversees about US$10 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo & Gardner. “One of the best features is that he is able to see opportunities broadly.”Buffett, 89, is set to host a virtual version of Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, an event that normally draws thousands of visitors to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Investors hope he’ll have the “washtub” that he described in his 2017 annual letter:“Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold,” Buffett wrote. “When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.”Bloomberg.com"

A survey of CFIB members shows 80% of small and medium firms are closed or operating at reduced capacity because of the pandemic, meaning only 20 per cent are fully operational.“Even in the optimistic scenario with full utilization of all of these support programs, I still see no scenario under which there are not tens of thousands of permanent business closures,” Kelly said Wednesday by phone from Toronto.

Small businesses need to be a focus of COVID-19 support, not an afterthought
Ottawa planning rent relief program for smaller businesses
The federal government has stepped up aid to businesses, introducing measures such as a 75 per cent wage subsidy and $40,000 loans, and a rent relief program is expected soon. But the measures weren’t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren’t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government’s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.“The bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that’s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,” Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Take ‘Months’Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. “It’s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.”And if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.“It doesn’t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,” Yussuff said. “This is a very difficult time so workers don’t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.”Bloomberg.com"

Becket called the bracelet’s owner “and told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale or deferred to a live auction at a later date.”But to Becket’s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well — very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. “Clients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,” she says. Some, Becket adds, told her “they’re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.”Everyone, she says, “is waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.”The results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby’s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.“What we’re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,” Becket says, “and actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.” A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of £90,000 (US$110,000) sold for £162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for £50,000, above a high estimate of £32,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that “I could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we’d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.” The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.Investment PotentialThe rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.“Polished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,” Rapaport wrote, while “shipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel’s plummeted by 73 per cent.” Meanwhile, “inventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.”If buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.“I don’t think people were buying for the sake of investment,” Becket says. “We had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.” It’s true, she continues, that “there has been a softening” in the auction market for jewelry as the value of loose stones has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.“The Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,” she explains. “The stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,” because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. “So the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.”A Million Dollars, Sight UnseenNow the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost a million dollars on a bracelet they’ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says, people are most willing to buy things with which they’re familiar: a Cartier “Love” bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a “broadening” of what’s done well at auction. “A multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn’t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,” she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers’ willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.“If these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,” she says, “where people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.”Bloomberg.com"

That briefly catapulted it ahead of Toronto-Dominion Bank on Monday to become the second-most valuable company on Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index, though it fell back to No. 3 on Tuesday as global markets slumped.“It’s tough to make money at the valuation Shopify is trading at,” said Jefferies analyst Samad Samana, one of the most bearish analysts on the stock. Risk-reward is not attractive and it’s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York.

Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is “somewhat surprising” given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company’s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify’s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not “necessarily equate to sales volume.”A likely recession, “if we’re not in one already,” will inevitably see a downturn in sales as “no one is immune” to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify’s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify’s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada’s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"

The strong demand comes at a time of supply disruptions as food makers adapt to dramatic shifts in buying patterns and some processing plants close as workers fall ill. As a result, stores are restricting purchases to prevent items from vanishing from shelves. For shoppers, that can be unnerving.“It’s not a shortage, it’s just that it needs to get from the supplier throughout the supply chain to the stores,” said Diane Brisebois, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Council of Canada. “There’s been an unexpected increase in demand for those products, and if those demands continue, it might take a bit longer to get them to the shelves.”

Overall, there’s enough retail supply, said Heather Garlich, a spokesperson for FMI, a food industry association that represents retailers and producers.But there have been “sporadic challenges” with high-demand products, and 49 per cent of U.S. shoppers report their supermarket has had products out of stock, according to the industry’s tracking. On popular items, “they could consider limits based on where the grocer may be located and when their supplier or wholesalers can get them product,” Garlich said.The dizzying variety of foods on grocery shelves has long been a trademark of North American supermarkets. That’s now changing, leaving shoppers worried. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus to making more of just a few core products, which makes it easier for retailers to restock supplies.

“The thing I’m struck by, in the U.S., we’re so used to walking down a supermarket aisle and having thousands of choices,” said Heidi Heitkamp, a former North Dakota Senator and current member of alliantgroup’s strategic advisory board. “Now that’s not what people see on the shelves and it’s a little unnerving. But what everyone should be grateful for is that you can walk into any supermarket in a major metro area and you can find food to eat. That’s a critically important national security concern.”There are signs that panic buying is waning and shoppers are returning to more traditional patterns. U.S. packaged food sales rose 24 per cent in the week ended April 4 from a year ago, slowing from a gain of 32 per cent a week earlier, according to data compiled by Nielsen. Limits on the number of visitors per store are also affecting sales.Costco Wholesale Corp.’s sales rose in March but not as much as expected. Limits placed on its operations to cope with coronavirus-related demand slowed growth in the back half of the month.

“I honestly think rationing may disappear at some point over the next few weeks because expectations have changed a little bit,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “People have come to accept what’s happening right now.”And while meat aisles remain stocked, the spread of coronavirus among North American slaughterhouses is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores. The shutdown of major U.S. processing plants, including Tyson Foods Inc.’s Waterloo plant in Iowa this week, means more than 15 per cent of the nation’s hog-slaughtering capacity is down.“Once we see the impact of workers testing positive in the packing plants, we’re going to see a shortage of meat,” said Heitkamp, the former senator.Bloomberg.com"

Season four of “The Crown,” an award-winning drama about British royals, is already in post-production, as is “Over the Moon,” an animated project.“We work really far out relative to the industry,” Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. “We don’t anticipate moving things around.”Over the past decade, Netflix has lured more than 180 million customers to its streaming service by offering a never-ending buffet of new shows. Seemingly nothing — not debt, not competition, not bad reviews — could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries.

But the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as a movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.With a lineup that includes “Too Hot to Handle,” “Black AF” and “Space Force,” Netflix isn’t going to run out of shows this quarter. It also has the rights to the Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance,” which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last quarter.“No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages and post-production) will play out,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie “Klaus,” and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It’s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can’t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix “The Lovebirds,” a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things” fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can’t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What’s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That’s why Netflix has minimized the impact of rival studios pulling popular programs like “The Office” and “Friends.”Bloomberg.com"

The average selling price for all homes was $819,665. Detached homes fell 4.6 per cent, dropping just below $1 million.“The state of emergency measures currently in place, including the necessary enforcement of social distancing, has impacted the real estate market in many ways,” TRREB President Michael Collins said in the statement. “Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and indeed their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction.”Home sales declines will likely be steepest in the second quarter as social-distancing measures remain in place for most of the spring, said TRREB. The real estate group forecasts that average prices for the year will likely remain near 2019 levels.“As we recover from this temporary downturn, potentially later this year, home buyers will move off the sidelines in increasing numbers as they satisfy pent-up demand for ownership housing,” said the board’s chief market analyst, Jason Mercer. “Increasingly, these buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the onset of COVID-19.”Bloomberg.com"

The oil market continued to hold investor attention, with Brent crude slumping to a two-decade low before rebounding. American crude surged above US$13 a barrel after President Donald Trump ordered the navy to destroy any Iranian gun boats that harass American ships at sea. The main U.S. oil ETF announced a reverse share split to buoy its flagging price.Investors are continuing efforts to assess the pandemic’s damage to the global economy, with the oil market chaos suggesting it will be deeper or longer than anticipated by those who drove the S&P 500 up 28 per cent from its March lows. Governments are devising ways to return people to work even as they discover infections are more extensive than they insisted only weeks ago.

Netflix forecasts 7.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter — a great quarter under normal circumstances. But investors, who sent the stock to new highs this week, may have wanted more. Though they initially bid Netflix shares up as much as 12% after the close Tuesday, the rally soon fizzled. The stock was little changed as of 5:38 p.m. in New York.“Like other home-entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth,” the company said in a letter to investors. “We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.”

Netflix heard the complaints: You can now turn off that annoying autoplay
How many people really are watching ‘The Mandalorian’? Data firms offer numbers that Disney and Netflix won’t
While COVID-19 has been devastating to the global economy, video-streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have found a captive audience. The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.“What we’re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,” said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter’s results reflected two of Netflix’s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as “The Irishman” and “The Two Popes,” Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. “Tiger King,” about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since “Stranger Things,” according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, “Love Is Blind,” a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, “Too Hot to Handle,” has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally — even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday’s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.“I understand the caution around the response to the stock,” Grous said, before adding, “But we’re not focused too much on quarter to quarter. We’re thinking about the long-term trend here, and that is explosive growth.”Bloomberg.com"

A massive supply glut brought on by the pandemic and a worldwide shortage of storage space have touched off an relentless rout that has shifted the entire forward curve for oil.The meltdown spreading across global oil markets has already wiped out tens of thousands of jobs and frozen billions of dollars in capital spending. Its deflationary effect threatens to further cripple economies around the world already reeling from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers have become overwhelmed by a vast oversupply brought on by an unprecedented plunge in global fuel demand.Oil is a “dangerous market to trade in right now,” said Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP, in a Bloomberg TV interview. The market needs oil production to fall immediately for prices to recover, he said.The price crash spilled into the ETF market, with the biggest crude-tracking fund, the United States Oil Fund LP, moving some of its WTI contracts into later months, according to a regulatory filing. The June/July WTI spread rallied more than US$1 a barrel on the move.Oil Ministers from the OPEC+ coalition held an unscheduled conference call on Tuesday to discuss the collapse without settling on new policy measures. The Texas Railroad Commission, meanwhile, opted to put off a decision on whether to impose oil-production quotas.In London, the immediate contract for Brent crude was at the biggest discount to the following month in data since 2008. U.S. marker WTI’s June contract was halted three times early in New York to manage the volatility, CME Group Inc. said.“If you start to look at the actual supply-demand situation for oil, it’s not so obvious that by the time those contracts expire, the storage situation around Cushing will be very different than what it is in May,” said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “The prices of these futures will need to connect to the physical reality, and they are likely to crack lower.”WTI for June dropped 43 per cent to US$11.57 a barrel in New York. The thinly traded May contract closed at US$10.01 a barrel.Brent crude futures for June slumped 24 per cent to close at US$19.33 a barrel.The collapse is reverberating across the oil industry, with prices trading below zero across America on Monday. WTI Midland in Texas — a flagship marker for the U.S. shale industry — was at -US$13.13 a barrel, while crude in Alaska was at -$US46.63.There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up. Royal Vopak NV, the world’s biggest independent storage company, said almost all of its space is sold.Crude stockpiles at Cushing — America’s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract — have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. U.S. nationwide inventories are estimated to have increased another 14 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Dated Brent benchmark, a global reference for nearly two thirds of the world’s physical flows, plunged to US$13.24 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since 1999, according to price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. That means that key European and African crude streams, including Urals from Russia and Bonny Light from Nigeria, would sell now under $10 a barrel, as they trade at a discount to the Dated Brent benchmark.Bloomberg.com"

But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.The US$4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker USO) slumped about 11 per cent to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32 per cent to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.USO didn’t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract’s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.“Additional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be ‘lights out’ as a partnership and could actually ‘owe’ money,” writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product’s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund’s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. “However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,” according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.“There has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,” she said. “Unclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we’re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.”In the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called “acceleration events” that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"

In Canada’s energy capital, they’re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and “a huge crater” in local government finances.

It’s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada’s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade’s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market’s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there’s an epic glut. Net asking rents — what the landlord receives — for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America’s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Boom, Bust, BustFour buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China’s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.“The office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,” said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.

Canada’s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers’ ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time 
 
“There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,” said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar’s director of market analytics for Canada. “Whereas now, it’s been bust for a long time.” His firm sees the city’s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.“It’s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they’re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,” Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn’t survive or deserted their leased space.Unemployment RisingThe crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary’s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil’s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary’s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.

Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that’s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar’s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.“The question is, ‘Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?’” Van Dijk said. “Whether it’s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s reduced the output of wood chips that pulp mills rely on to make everything from toilet paper and wipes to cardboard boxes and paper bags, said Derek Nighbor, president and chief executive officer of the Ottawa-based Forest Products Association of Canada.Without federal aid to get some sawmill capacity back on line, input costs could rise or there could be a shortage of the materials pulp mills need for household products, he said. Panic buying has already caused shortages of toilet paper and other hygiene products in supermarkets around the world.

“The demand from pulp mills has gone up at a time when we’re starting to see the chip supply become more scarce from the sawmills,” Nighbor said in a telephone interview. “It could drive the cost up or there could be product constraints for sure in the months ahead.”High production costs in Canada squeezed profits for sawmills.

A deal for Caltex Australia would have marked the largest acquisition in the country this year as well as the third-biggest in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The current situation in the world is highly uncertain,” Couche-Tard said in a statement. “The COVID-19 crisis is first and foremost a human tragedy that has impacted millions of people and has also been meaningfully disruptive to economies and businesses around the world, including the Australian fuel and convenience retail industries.”

The Canadian company said it continues to see Caltex Australia as a “strong strategic fit” and plans to re-engage “once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook.” Matthew Halliday, Caltex Australia’s interim chief executive officer, said in an interview that the company has a “reasonably strong” balance sheet and continues to explore an initial public offering or trade sale for its property assets.Shares of Caltex Australia plummeted as much as 9.1 per cent in Sydney on Monday. The stock dropped 7.8 per cent at close, while the country’s benchmark index S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.5 per cent .Couche-Tard’s dropout could shift the focus to bids by other parties including the closely-held EG Group. The U.K.-based company in February offered to pay A$3.9 billion in cash for Caltex’s retail outlets along with shares in a new listed company made up of the remaining fuel refining operations. However, Caltex’s board rejected EG’s bid a month later.Caltex Australia, which has a network of about 2,000 retail fuel sites, hasn’t received any updates since then, Halliday said in the interview on Monday.“It’s fair to say everyone is focused on managing their way through the current situation,” the interim CEO said. “EG remains a very significant customer of ours, so we talk to EG all the time but no meaningful update from a transactional point of view.”Couche-Tard, owner of convenience stores operating under brands including Circle K, first offered to acquire Caltex Australia in October and sweetened its offer a month later to A$34.50 cash per share. Caltex Australia rejected the A$8.6 billion offer but gave the Canadian firm “selected non-public information” for a revised proposal. In February, Couche-Tard boosted its offer for a second time to A$8.8 billion, which is equivalent to A$35.25 apiece in cash.A plunge in oil prices and coronavirus-induced curbs on travel added uncertainty to the business outlook for both Couche-Tard and Caltex Australia. Due diligence for the deal was completed last week, though Halliday said the Canadian convenience-store giant didn’t table a final price.On Monday, Caltex reported an A$29 million net loss for the first quarter, following an earlier announcement that it would extend the maintenance shutdown of its Lytton refinery in Queensland as well as disclosing that its convenience shop sale levels were flat compared to 2019. The company has said it expects jet fuel demand in Australia to drop by as much as 90% as the country’s airlines slash their schedules.Couche-Tard indicated that any deal could be concluded quickly if revived.“We remain convinced of the long-term financial and strategic merits of an acquisition of Caltex and all the benefits it would offer to the shareholders of both companies,” Couche-Tard Chief Executive Officer Brian Hannasch said in the statement. “Our current plan would be to re-engage the process once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook, and the work done to date should mean that we will be able to quickly formalize our proposal at that time.”Bloomberg.com"

Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and largest shareholder, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at the plant in Fremont and would defy the county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He got support from President Donald Trump.The county and six municipalities in the densely-populated region decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let some manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities had the ability to keep stricter measures in place. The Bay area was the first region in the country to lock down via shelter in place orders and has been the most cautious about reopening, citing the need to ramp up testing capacity, contact tracing and making sure that there is an ample supply of PPE, or personal protective equipment.Musk sent an email to employees early Tuesday: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.Two workers who have returned to the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.

The work in Fremont comes as Tesla is actively seeking a new location to build its second gigafactory. Musk has also said that Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas. He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk was not shy about suing Alameda County. Tesla filed suit against the county on Saturday.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen.

But companies are also considering how best to redesign their operations to prevent infections, including by automating some lines altogether. The likely result: higher costs for an industry dominated by the likes of Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS SA that’s been very efficient at pumping out cheap meat.The changes are arriving as concerns mount over mega-plants staffed with low-paid workers operating elbow-to-elbow. More than 10,000 meat workers have been infected by the coronavirus, and at least 30 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.

“Americans want to buy cheaper and cheaper and cheaper food,” said Matthew Wadiak, founder of Cooks Venture, a small chicken producer selling directly to consumers. “We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what’s the cost of a human life? It’s a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout.”Workers at meatpacking plants continue to fall ill, even with barriers placed between them, more protective equipment and enhanced social-distancing measures in common areas including cafeterias and locker rooms.While President Donald Trump has ordered plants to reopen, many are running at slower-than-usual rates to try to reduce the spread. Reducing plants to a third of their capacity and distributing the adequate protective equipment could boost chicken prices at grocery stores by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Sanchoy Das, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what's the cost of a human life? It's a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout 
 
“The 99-cents per pound chicken could be in short supply very quickly,” said Das, whose research focuses primarily on supply chain modelling and analysis.Tyson’s operating costs are sharply higher due to the novel coronavirus and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Chief Executive Officer Noel White and Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said at the BMO Farm to Market virtual conference on Wednesday. That includes US$120 million in bonus for employees, personal protection equipment as well as factory shutdowns and slowdowns.

The bulk of America’s beef and pork are processed in a few dozen giant plants that handle thousands of animals in lines that have been allowed to run faster and faster. Tyson, JBS and Cargill Inc. control about two-thirds of America’s beef. Pork and chicken production is similarly concentrated.The outbreak could also help accelerate automation plans companies have already in the works. Tyson has said it is investing “aggressively” in automating the most difficult tasks within its plants. The company is installing robots in the deboning areas of its poultry plants, and also has initiatives in beef and pork.“You are going to see a bifurcation where the larger, more profitable facilities are going to move toward a vastly more automated meat processing facility,” said Decker Walker, an agribusiness expert at Boston Consulting Group. “Incentives for automation have never been higher.”Incentives for automation have never been higherDecker Walker 
 
Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. was increasing its use of automation and robotics even before the pandemic. The company invested more than US$30 million in automation last year, projects that are helping plants to run efficiently in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.“We believe in automation, we believe in robotics, and we’re going to continue to move down that path,” Chief Executive Officer Jayson Penn said in an April 30 call with analysts.Meat processing is usually a low-margin business, meaning companies will be wary of overspending. While there’s probably going to be a lot of change in the way packers do business, consumers will pay for it in the long run, said Steve Meyer, an economist at consultancy Kerns & Associates.“This whole system was designed to produce quality products at the most reasonable cost possible, so you don’t go and add a lot of extra cost to go handle a once-in-a-100-year situation,” Meyer said. “But you also don’t turn a blind eye to the fact that people are sick and some people died. So I think there will be some changes made.”Another way to reduce infections, especially in poultry plants, would be to produce more whole chickens, as cutting up birds into legs and thighs requires more labor, said Das of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.Consumers in the U.S. can afford to pay a bit more for their meat, said Wadiak of Cooks Venture. That would increase wages and help avoid shared living accommodation, which has been a challenge for meat plant workers looking to adhere to social-distancing practices.“When the budget is tight, it’s hard to put food on the table, it’s hard to feed your family, I really, really get that,” he said. “But if that means you are putting food on your table at the cost of someone else’s life, it’s not worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Earlier this month, an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, also called for Lindsay’s replacement and said the company should divest its energy and coal businesses.Both investors are critical of Teck’s dual-class share structure, which allows the Keevil family — which has been involved with the firm for more than six decades — to control the company.Most of Teck’s A-shares are held by Temagami Mining Co., which is owned by the Keevil family and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Speaking at a Bank of America conference on Tuesday, Lindsay said that only Temagami has the power to dismantle the dual-class structure, which he believes will stay in place “for the foreseeable future.”

Thus far, Lindsay has refrained from commenting directly on the shareholder activism, although the company has issued statements saying he has widespread shareholder support. The miner also says the stock’s decline — 59 per cent in the past year in Toronto — is mostly due to falling commodity prices.Lindsay reiterated that point at the virtual conference and also defended his strategy for the company.“We know that investors tend to be cautious during these phases,” he said, referring to Teck’s “investment cycle” in which it’s ramping up its copper business and trying to boost its steelmaking-coal margins. “We’ve seen something very similar before during financing and construction of another high-altitude copper mine — Antamina — which also coincided with a significant downturn in the market.”‘Penalty Box’Lindsay was referring to construction of the Antamina mine in Peru which was completed in 2001, spokesman Chris Stannell said in an email following the speech.Throughout that period, Teck’s share price was in the “penalty box,” Lindsay reminded analysts. “But our then-CEO and now chairman emeritus Dr. Keevil, he had the vision and the tenacity to see it through.”Since then, Teck has weathered other commodity downturns. In 2015, the company was stripped of its investment grade rating amid the collapse of the commodities supercycle.

They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell’s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March 
 
Worrying ScenarioThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.“Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,” Powell said. “The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.”While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksFed chairman Jerome Powell 
 
Congressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump’s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank’s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.‘Significant’ Risks“While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,” Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would “continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,” but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.“When this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

It far exceeded the maximum loss anticipated by HSBC’s value-at-risk models.HSBC’s loss highlights the extreme nature of the disruption to the gold market in late March, as lockdowns closed refineries and grounded planes, strangling the supply routes that allow physical bullion to move around the globe.

The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London, which usually trade within a few dollars an ounce of one another, diverged by as much as US$70 — the most in four decades. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.HSBC, which had disclosed in a previous filing that it was hit by the gold market disruption, revealed the scale of the loss in a chart this week showing its daily trading profits for the first quarter.The bank described the loss as a “mark-to-market loss mainly associated with gold refining and transportation challenges.” It highlighted the “unprecedented widening of the gold exchange-for-physical basis,” which “affected HSBC’s gold leasing and financing business and other gold hedging activity leading to mark-to-market losses.”HSBC declined to comment.In the past week, the price difference between the New York and London markets has returned to more normal levels of less than US$5 an ounce.Still, HSBC is not the only one struggling with the unusual moves in the gold market. Banks often sell gold futures in New York to hedge their positions in the London market, exposing them to significant losses should the two markets diverge.As a result, some banks have stepped back from trading the EFP in recent weeks. And Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia, for years one of the leading bullion traders with a business that dates back to the 17th century, told staff in April it was shuttering its precious metals unit.Bloomberg.com"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020Musk, 48, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at its plant in Fremont, California, flouting county officials who ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He openly acknowledged he was taking the chance he or his staff may be apprehended, though he wrote in a Twitter post: Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020Health officers for Alameda County and six other San Francisco Bay area municipalities decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May. While Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities could keep stricter measures in place.Overnight, Musk sent an email to employees: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.

Elon Musk unleashes tweet storm, threatening to pull Tesla out of California over ‘absurd and medically irrational’ shutdown
When asked on Twitter how Monday went at the factory, Musk replied Tuesday: “Great.” Tesla’s shares rose as much as 3.9 per cent as of 11:50 a.m. in New York trading. The stock price has doubled this year.Two workers who have returned to work at the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.Musk’s emailed words of encouragement followed tweets in which he claimed Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas and may even cease manufacturing in California. To follow through on those threats, the CEO would have to uproot many of the roughly 20,000 employees the carmaker has in the San Francisco Bay area. About half of the company’s headcount is at the factory.He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk is waging another legal battle. This time, he’s tangling with health officials over measures to contain a virus that he downplayed starting in January.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Alameda County issued a statement Monday saying Tesla’s Fremont plant was operating beyond what was allowed and that it hoped the company would “comply without further enforcement measures.” The county has been in an ongoing dialogue over employee health-screening procedures and said it will continue to review Tesla’s plans.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen. The nation’s top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, warned against reopening the economy too soon during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying that doing so risks new coronavirus outbreaks throughout the U.S.Trump’s supportive Twitter post followed words of encouragement that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offered to Musk on Monday.“He’s one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “California should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely.”Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director and Elon’s brother, shared a story on Mnuchin’s remarks with his more than 107,000 followers. “Only California and @GavinNewsom⁩ could make me a Trump fan,” he wrote.Bloomberg.com"

We’re worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home.”Carrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shook the industry and underscored concern about mental health.

“It’s a very stressful situation,” said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which represents local unions. “The prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points.”Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship’s crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to Covid-19, the company said. Carnival, the world’s largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker’s family.

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 line and owner of Celebrity Cruises, said a crew member went overboard from its Jewel of the Seas about two weeks ago.‘Suicidal’ MessagesCrew members have said the reported deaths have rattled them and dampened morale, said Krista Thomas, a former Norwegian Cruise Line guest manager who’s operating two Facebook pages for stranded crew and their families. In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.“Many of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they’re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,” said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. “Many have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.”The cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.“That one simple question – how do we get you home? – turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,” Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. “Each country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions – and they frequently change without notice.”About 15 countries won’t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.

About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.CDC RequirementsThe business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.“This whole experience has been a nightmare,” said Carrick. “I can’t even think of coming back to a ship.”Bloomberg.com"

To stem the spread of Covid-19, it will implement temperature checks, require masks and prohibit lines for toilets, with lavatories made available on request.The carrier’s push to get planes back in the air clashes with comments from U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said Britons were unlikely to be vacationing abroad this summer. O’Leary said practical measures to resume travel should be worked out over the next several weeks.“By the time we get to the first of July, we think masks and temperature checks will become the norm in train stations, on board trains and undergrounds, on buses, in public transport across Europe,” O’Leary said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday. “It would be a reasonably modest extension to add those to airport terminals and on board aircraft.”Ryanair gained as much as 3.8 per cent in Dublin trading. The stock has tumbled 38 per cent this year.‘Unenforcable’ QuarantineTrouble is, within the European Union, each nation sets its own rules on entry. Britain, which just left the bloc but remains a major hub for flights in the region, plans a two-week quarantine on incoming travellers that executives have decried as tantamount to a ban.“The U.K. 14-day isolation is nonsense,” O’Leary said. “There’s no scientific basis for it whatsoever.”While the European Commission is preparing recommendations for removing border controls, the Ryanair tussle highlights the conflicting priorities that could make the resumption of air travel a bumpy one.Lavish Holidays UnlikelyO’Leary said the airline has seen a surge in bookings since announcing its resumption of service early Tuesday, adding that there’s pent-up demand, especially from families, who want to take their typical two-week summer vacations abroad. That’s after Hancock told ITV it’s “unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible this summer.”Spain’s tourism industry, a key driver of the economy, was also dealt a potential blow when the government decreed this week that all people arriving from abroad will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in “their homes or lodgings.” The measure will stay in force until the current state of emergency is lifted.Ryanair said it would restart flights from most of its bases, and will offer seats starting from 20 euros (US$21.60) one-way. Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.Coordination PlansThe U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.“What it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. “The problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.”The EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a “tourism package” of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers. The EU’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, told lawmakers last week that digital contact-tracing apps might “enable at least some traveling during the summer.”Bloomberg.com"

In 2019, Lindsay’s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck’s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company’s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen.

“At our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck’s shareholders for the company’s strategy,” Brown said by phone.Impala’s letter alleges four projects — the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada’s oilsands — have destroyed over $12 billion in value.“It’s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,” Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. “The company’s paying top dollar for underperformance.”It's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsBob Bishop 
 
Impala’s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay’s strategy as lacking “clear direction or coherence,” and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.

As for Teck’s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: “We have been very clear that if we can’t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.”Impala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.“The dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,” Bishop said. Instead, “it has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.”Chair MeetingIn March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck’s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. “These have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we’re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.”Bishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck’s zinc and copper assets. He also said he’s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.“If they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,” he said.Tribeca DemandsTribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck’s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.“If you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,” he said. “The shareholding structure is probably in the ‘undeliverable’ so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.”Bloomberg.com"

The Fed could curtail Wall Street banks’ ability to pay dividends by cranking up the amount of capital they need to maintain due to the coronavirus crisis, Governor Randal Quarles said Tuesday.“You will get business failures on a grand scale and you will be taking risks that you would go into depression” if shutdowns persist, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said in a video speech from that city Tuesday. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise.Wall Street’s three major averages closed around their session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 457.21 points, or 1.89 per cent, to 23,764.78, the S&P 500 lost 60.2 points, or 2.05 per cent, to 2,870.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 189.79 points, or 2.06 per cent, to 9,002.55. The TSX was down 222 points at 14,881.The disastrous fallout of business closures and stay-at-home orders caused an unprecedented 20.5 million job losses in April, tripling the unemployment rate to 14.7 per cent, the highest since the Great Depression era of the 1930s. A key measure of U.S. consumer prices declined last month by the most on record. A sustained trend of declining prices would spur worries about deflation, exacerbating concern that the recovery from the deep economic downturn will be very slow.Buyers of U.S. stocks after the economy shrank in the first quarter have history on their side, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Private Wealth Management.

Newsom, who allowed manufacturing in parts of the state to restart May 8, said Monday that the county decided to enforce stricter rules around reopening.When asked about Tesla reopening its Fremont plant regardless of Alameda’s order, Newsom said he was unaware.“It was my understanding when I walked up to the podium today that that wasn’t the case,” he said.Alameda’s public health department declined to comment.Musk, 48, tweeted over the weekend that Alameda’s refusal to let Tesla reopen the Fremont factory was “the final straw” and that he’d immediately move Tesla’s headquarters to Nevada or Texas.Newsom said Monday the state has a strong relationship with Tesla, calling it “a company that this state has substantively supported for now many, many years.” Musk then thanked the governor in a tweet.Bloomberg.com"

A halving happens about every four years and slows down the rate at which new tokens are created — an intentional feature designed to control inflation. Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen into the event and jumped after, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies averaged 446 days.Here’s a QuickTake on what Bitcoin’s “halving” means.“So far, Bitcoin’s third halving looks different to prior events and there doesn’t appear to have been such a sustained price run-up,” said Payal Lakhani, director of equity research and product development at CME Group, in a blog post Friday. “Given the reward change has been known since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, and having already seen two such events, investors may have already incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.”The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in lower volumes as some participants focused on non-crypto markets, and some mining operations being affected by these difficult market conditions, Lakhani said.Bloomberg.com"

Parks, factories and restaurants in cities and countries around the world are reopening under rules to keep customers and workers apart amid the threat of second waves and flare-ups of the virus.To reach the gates of Shanghai Disneyland, guests had to pass through body temperature checks and show that their health status has been confirmed using a smartphone app for tracking infected persons. Masks were mandatory, despite the muggy 23 degree Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) weather.

Popcorn and chicken wing stands were open, though fewer than on a normal day.Live theatre shows, areas where children would come into close contact, such as water play spots, and parades have been suspended during the initial reopening to avoid raising infection risks.“The real test will come as those capacity limits are eased and the calendar moves into what is typically the critical peak summer season,” said Ron Merriman, managing director of theme park consultants MR ProFun China. “But I am very optimistic about the park’s prospects for passing that test.”

While Disney is keeping its U.S., Hong Kong and Paris parks closed, the company said last week it would open a limited number of shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs mall outside its resorts in Orlando, Florida, on May 20.Tickets to Shanghai Disneyland during the initial reopening phase are 399 yuan (US$56) for regular days, and 499 yuan for weekends.Disney’s theme parks division contributed about 46 per cent of operating income in the 12 months ended September 2019, more than double the earnings from its studio entertainment business, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Bloomberg.com"

While the loan-loss provisions “figure is certainly higher than what we had estimated, in a vacuum and without comparisons to other banks we think this new information should be viewed as neutral and not terribly surprising,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic wrote in a note to clients. The Canadian banks under international accounting standards “should be expected to book larger provisions” in the second quarter, he said.Toronto-Dominion, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets, is scheduled to report quarterly results on May 28.Bloomberg.com"

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.“We began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,” Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure’s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. “We would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.”Brookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn’t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield’s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia’s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure’s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.“Our outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,” Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a ‘swoosh’ shape than ‘U’ or a ‘V’ with the aid of government stimulus. He said he expects most sectors and businesses to return to a more normal environment by the end of 2020 or first half of 2021, assuming there is not significant second wave of the virus.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The last company to surpass Royal Bank’s market capitalization was drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in July 2015. Months later, the value of the Quebec-based company plunged amid controversies over business practices, accounting and drug pricing. Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. — the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. — crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.’s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada’s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck. The telecommunications-equipment maker ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was liquidated.

The dramatic collapse of two Canadian tech giants in a country more known for being hewers of wood and drawers of water has hung over the country’s corporate psyche for years. So Shopify’s rise has been cheered on by many.“I think it’s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,” said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify “should be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it’s tech sector because it’s been remarkable what they’ve done,” he said. Jackson had owned the company’s stock but doesn’t currently have a position. Its U.S.-listed shares have risen by 43 times since the initial public offering at US$17 in 2015.Too Fast?This year’s rally, which has seen the stock double, has drawn its doubters.“On just about any valuation metric, this is one of the most expensive stocks in Techland,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco told clients in a note Wednesday.

The regulator must work with the CME to determine whether the price moves were a one-time occurrence or a reflection of dynamics in the contract that could recur, Berkovitz said in a statement.A rapid plunge in the final minutes of trading on April 20 that pushed prices to below zero thrust one of the world’s most-traded futures into the spotlight. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said the agency is “conducting a deep dive” to understand the move, but that the negative prices appeared to have been a result of supply and demand related to storage capacity and the global economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.“The WTI contract is a key benchmark in the energy and financial markets,” Berkovitz said in his statement, which was prepared for a meeting of a CFTC advisory committee that he leads. “A futures contract that is disconnected from the physical market cannot serve as a means to discover prices or manage price risks arising from the use of the commodity.”Berkovitz said he’s concerned that many of the same dynamics that drove the move in the May contract haven’t been resolved. The WTI June contract, the next futures to come due, expires on May 19.“There is a high probability that the supply, demand and storage conditions that were present during trading in the May spot month will persist through the upcoming weeks and into the spot month for the June WTI futures contract,” Berkovitz said.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

A representative for Midland, Michigan-based Dow declined comment.The potential divestitures echo moves across the industry to focus on manufacturing chemicals efficiently while hiving off responsibility for running the ground infrastructure, from power supplies to transportation. Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets last year paid Bayer AG and Lanxess AG more than $3.5 billion to take over their chemical park operations, gaining a steady income from long-term service and supply contracts with the companies on site.Dow’s marine and storage operations, known as its Mars unit, includes 136 chemical and liquid hyrdocarbon tanks with 200 million gallons (760 million liters) of capacity, as well as 11 marine docks, according to one of the people. The terminals — including ones in Freeport, Texas, and St. Charles and Plaquemine in Louisiana — are located near railway lines operated by Union Pacific Corp. Open land and unused tank capacity may also be included in a transaction, the person said.More than 70% of Mars revenue last year came from Dow, and the company would seek a 25-year contract with the buyer for marine and terminal services, one of the people said. The business also has third-party customers, most which have a minimum of 15 years remaining on their leases.For the potential rail divestiture, Dow wants a similar long-term partner for infrastructure critical to its manufacturing operations at six sites in North America, another person briefed on the matter said. The plants in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; and in Alberta, Canada, at Calgary and Edmonton, represent the bulk of Dow’s olefins and polyethlene production capacity.Dow has accounted for more than 75% of its rail business’s revenue, which had a compound annual growth rate of about 7% over the last three years, the person said. The company has offered to sign a 25-year agreement with potential suitors. Other existing contracts have roughly 12 years remaining, on average.The company, led by Chief Executive Officer James Fitterling, has seen its stock tumble 42% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 12% drop for the S&P 500 Index.

A separate proposal, which was coordinated by the investor activist group ShareAction and backed by money managers at Amundi SA and Jupiter Asset Management, called for the phase-out of financing activities to the most carbon-intensive energy companies. It received 23.95% support.The vote could go down as a milestone event because it’s the first climate change resolution at a European bank, and demonstrates how banks’ contribution to global warming remains a top priority for investors. It also showed how shareholders can force banks and other large corporations to use their vast resources to combat climate change and other social ills.“Today’s result shows the value of shareholder engagement with banks on climate change,” said Faith Ward, the Bristol-based chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership. “This resolution came about as a direct result of intensive shareholder engagement over the past year, including the first-ever shareholder climate resolution at a major European bank.”While Brunel was among firms that filed the shareholder resolution and had hoped to see both proposals pass, Ward said the shareholder resolution got more than 20% support, which means it surpassed a threshold that requires Barclays to consult with shareholders and explain the views received and actions taken publicly within six months.The shareholder resolution was put forward in January and urged Barclays to say how it will phase out financing for energy companies that don’t align with the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. As a growing number of investors pledged to support the resolution, Barclays in March put forward its own net- zero alternative, which ShareAction criticized for leaving unanswered questions about the bank’s financing activities in the short term.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said today’s votes send “an unequivocal signal not just to the board of Barclays but to the entire global banking sector that all banks must start to phase out” fossil-fuel financing.“Today’s voting results will send shock waves through the banking industry,” Howarth said. “While Barclays is Europe’s largest fossil-fuel financier, it is far from being the only bank to prop up companies that are driving the climate crisis.”Barclays provided more than 100 billion pounds ($123 billion) of funds to fossil-fuel companies since the Paris climate accord was signed, according to data compiled by Rainforest Action Network, which includes information gathered from Bloomberg.For some, London-based Barclays hasn’t gone far enough to change its trajectory.“Rather than backing a resolution that set out a clear pathway for Barclays to finally end its vast contribution to the climate emergency, the bank chose to hoodwink both shareholders and the public with an alternative option — one with distant targets and no substance,”said Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace U.K.’s head of climate finance. “There is nothing wrong with a net-zero target but, without details of how it will get there, Barclays’s ambition is all show and no go.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Martel, who used to head the business jets division before leaving Bombardier for a few years to head Canada’s biggest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, said he hasn’t seen many order cancellations so far. That’s a contrast with December 2014, when cancellations started piling up after oil prices collapsed, he said.“It is moving at a slow pace, there’s no decision being made,” Martel said, adding that customers have asked for information on plane availability and timing as they assess the duration and impact of the pandemic. “We think that when we have more visibility on the pandemic that the activity level will be restarting.”Bigger JetsDemand for bigger private jets seems more solid than for smaller aircraft, Martel said.The Montreal-based company, which suspended its financial forecast in March, said it would offer updated projections when it has greater visibility on the pandemic’s impact.“We have limited exposure today on the light jet versus either 2008 or even 2014,” he said. “We always felt going into those crises that the large-segment market was much more robust. And today, as you know, we are much more dependent on that segment, which makes me believe that our backlog will remain much more solid.”Bloomberg.com"

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.“It will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men’s jobs affected,” according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers — where many women work — is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a “she-cession,” April’s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Construction in CrosshairsBrendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday’s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn’t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. “The hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,” Bernard said by phone.While Friday’s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it’s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University’s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.“That’s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,” Moffatt said. “The job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.”Path to RecoveryThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won’t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.“Once things start to return to normal, it’s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,” Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.“We are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,” Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"

Bitcoin breaks through $10,000 level with traders setting their sights on $11,000
Bitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin’s undergone two prior halvings — or halvenings, as they’re sometimes called — which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world’s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017’s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days — should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there’s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin’s halving, he wrote in a recent note.Price PredictionsTo be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor’s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn’t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.“It is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,” Pal wrote in a recent presentation. “It was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.”Jefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly “Greed & Fear” newsletter recommended investors — including institutions — buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token’s prior price surges around the event.“To invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,” he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification “precisely because of its truly decentralized nature,” he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeAntoni Trenchev 
 
Venture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. “Bitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,” he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels. Though the halving may already be priced in, it will lead to huge appreciation over time, he said.“Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it’s by far the best performing asset of the past decade,” he said. “We’re bullish about its future.”Trenchev is seeing “huge” demand for his firm’s products ahead of the coin’s halving. “We’re not hiring because of the halving per se. We’re hiring because the halving has been lifting Bitcoin and will continue to do so,” he said.Hiring HikeA number of crypto exchanges have also embarked on hiring sprees. Kraken LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. are expanding their workforces, as are OkEx and Coinbase Inc.David Janczewski, the chief executive officer and founder of Cardiff, Wales-based Coincover, said any market event that impacts adoption is a positive for his business.“That’s part of what we see — when the last spike happened, we know that an awful lot of people moved into the market because they felt they ought to get in on the action,” said Janczewski, whose firm offers insurance against crypto thefts and scams. “Ultimately, anything that causes the market to be aware, or wider investment markets to be aware of crypto, tends to be a good thing from our perspective.”Bloomberg.com"

Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more “difficult adjustments” would be put forth in the next two weeks. “Days like this are brutal,” he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a “last wave” in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber’s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees. If the case is successful, the companies could be on the hook for substantial new costs that further jeopardize their business models.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

HSBC said that the gold market “became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,” contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to “market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.” It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC’s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium. The precious metal surged more than 30% in the first three weeks of January, before tumbling at the end of the month.Read More: HSBC, BNP Repeatedly Breached Trading Limits in Market ChaosHSBC is not alone in its recent struggles with precious metals.

As governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he’s pivoting to “phase two” of the nation’s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.

U.S. President Donald Trump declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles.

Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said. “But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”On his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as “warriors” as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.

Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”And while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.“There’ll be more death,” he said. “The virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal.”“But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it,” Trump said. “I think our economy is going to be raging” next year, he added.No Face MaskWhile in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done “safely.”Yet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and Guns N’ Roses’s version of “Live and Let Die.”Senior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn’t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that “doctors” he didn’t name had advised him to close the economy “for a couple of years.”“I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we’ve ever had,” Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. “And then one day they said, ‘we have to close our country.’ Well, now it’s time to open up.”Public-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.Models ‘So Wrong’But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a “fire” that could be extinguished “fast.”He also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriorsDonald Trump 
 
“These models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They’ve been so wrong, they’ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they’re wrong,” the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on “faulty assumptions” about mitigation efforts and didn’t represent federal government projections.“The people of our country are warriors,” Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are “somewhat” or “very” worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.“Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And we’ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,” Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: “No.”Bloomberg.com"

From buying bonds to paying wages, authorities are playing a role in the economy that was unimaginable even a few months ago.To be clear, it’s not like they had much choice. The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market — whether it’s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies — the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come. Cutting and running too soon risks stripping away a vital safety net that both companies and workers may still need. Staying too long risks crowding out private players.Big government may be back, but how long it’s welcome is another story.Global HeadlinesPhase two | President Donald Trump fixed his course on reopening the nation for business, acknowledging that the move would cause more illness and death from the pandemic but insisting it’s a cost he’s willing to pay to get the economy back on track. Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China’s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a “decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the “blame game,” saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. “It’s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,” he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.’s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country’s exit from lockdown. With Europe’s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country’s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled. Trump supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members and sent him a message describing the initiative as a “good idea,” the American ambassador to Moscow told the Interfax news service. Russian mercenaries are engaged in a large-scale effort in Libya to bolster eastern commander Khalifa Haftar providing technical support, direct involvement in combat operations and sophisticated influence campaigns, according to United Nations experts. Ivory Coast arrested 14 soldiers and five civilians on allegations of planning a coup linked to presidential hopeful Guillaume Soro, who was sentenced in absentia last week on charges of embezzlement and money laundering.Tell us how we’re doing or what we’re missing at balancepower@bloomberg.net.And finally … Long a target of the Philippines’ outspoken president, Rodrigo Duterte, the country’s largest media company was ordered to close overnight after its franchise expired.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) — Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a third in six weeks while much of the commodities universe melts down. Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of pandemic-related mine closures, are adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand softened by industrial lockdowns. There will be no swift return to lofty levels last seen over a decade ago, but the metal may still be the only one to end the year with a record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged by a factor of 13 between 2003 and 2007. That hastened a production splurge that put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce more at depressed prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada’s Cameco has suspended production at its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan. Kazakhstan’s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It’s true that almost all metals have seen a blow to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that’s dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers, whose own factories have been shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34 per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others have climbed, too: London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF have recovered from their 2020 nadirs.The real question is what happens next. Even $34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A significant proportion of producers still don’t make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities are sitting on a still-substantial four years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit will keep upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners is close to $55, though existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even an approval today won’t ease the squeeze fast: A new uranium operation takes years.Then there’s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as traditional users find their reactors are aging, and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher: The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide emissions almost equivalent to two years of those related to global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a renewed preoccupation with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses when it comes to a metal that isn’t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling, too. For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

He promised employees that the McLean, Virginia-based firm will give them at least six weeks’ notice once it decides to reopen those sites.That’s one of the strongest signs yet that legions of industry employees using makeshift work stations at home may have to wait much longer to return to their offices, even as many states begin lifting restrictions on public life. Capital One, which earns most of its revenue from its massive credit card business, said in late March that it had more than 40,000 people doing their jobs remotely online — accounting for more than three-quarters of its workforce.Many major financial firms have yet to publicly set dates for reopening offices as they grapple with numerous challenges, such as how to help employees safely commute, ascend elevators and navigate shared workspaces. And those that have weighed in on the topic have expressed caution. At Citigroup Inc., for example, President Jane Fraser said last month that the firm will conduct its own analyses of risks and won’t necessarily reopen offices just because local authorities issue all-clears.Capital One has spent years investing in technology and was among the first U.S. banks to announce it would transition to cloud computing. Those moves have helped the firm operate more effectively during this crisis, Fairbank said in the memo.Decisions to return will vary by location, dependent on local conditions, he said. Meanwhile, most of the lender’s branches have remained open, serving customers with drive-thru or from behind glass.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

She said the lender expects that 30 per cent to 80 per cent of employees may continue to work from home at least some of the time. The Toronto-based bank employed about 45,000 people as of Jan. 31.“We’ve been able to maintain continuity of banking services with far more people working outside the office than we ever thought possible,” Malone said Monday in an interview. “We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we’ve proven through this is that’s actually not the case.”

Chief Executive Officer Darryl White has said “a 2.0 version” of the workplace may include the blended home-and-office arrangements, as big employers worldwide reconfigure offices and routines. Malone said Canadian and U.S. branch employees have “by and large” been going into work during the crisis along with a “small amount” of technology and operations employees, while 95 per cent of those in office towers have been working from home.About two-thirds of the firm’s employees are in Canada, while 13,408 are in the U.S. and 1,578 overseas. The post-COVID plan involves more workers at home including “a ton” of employees with hybrid office-and-home roles, and fewer people working solely at company locations, Malone said.“It’s a blended approach of thinking about productivity and flexibility and for us not a return to the way it used to be,” she said. “It’s about an evolution in the way that we work.”We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we've proven through this is that's actually not the caseMona Malone 
 
As with many companies worldwide, COVID-19 has already upended much of the workforce of Canada’s fourth-largest bank. For example, call-centre agents initially went into offices at the start of the outbreak. Then in the past month, the bank shifted half of its Canadian call-centre staff and 80 per cent of its U.S. agents to home offices.“That’s not a temporary thing,” Malone said. “We don’t have to think about contact centres as just these geographical hubs, and we can use this remote way of working.”The work-from-anywhere trend helps keep employees safe, Malone said. Crowding workers into office towers while dealing with mass transit, elevators and social distancing is “problematic.” She added that the new approach can also present recruitment possibilities.“It allows us to look for new talent in locations where maybe we haven’t before, and tap into talent pools across the country,” she said.The bank has already seen unexpected benefits in deal-making, as investment bankers use time once spent on commuting to communicate with clients. One investment banker in New York expressed surprise that “doing pitches virtually” has been a success, Malone said.“It’s causing this person who’s 25 years an investment banker to rethink what’s possible,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.Hospitals ‘Very Tight’The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute.

Meanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com"

That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It’s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it’s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services.Labor market destruction isn’t unique to Canada.

However, that number has been shrinking as companies that grew too fast and are now dealing with pandemic-related disruptions cut back.Canopy Growth Corp. said Wednesday that it’s cutting 200 jobs in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K., about 5 per cent of its total workforce. That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then COVID-19 came and exacerbated it.”Not everyone is cutting back, however. Trulieve Cannabis Corp., one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies by market value, has hired around 250 people since the pandemic started and still has about 150 open positions.The Florida-based company has doubled the number of vehicles in its delivery fleet and saw its call centre volume spike from 25,000 calls a week to 65,000 as customers adapted to the new realities of pandemic shopping. It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

As for high-end Los Angeles real estate, it’s not exactly a seller’s market at the moment. Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings. Fewer buyers were coming from China, Russia and the Middle East amid international tensions, and limits on state and local tax deductions dampened the appeal of owning California homes for wealthy U.S. buyers.

National Post

Tim Bray, a vice president and veteran engineer with the company’s cloud-computing division, said in a post on his personal blog that he quit “in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.”Bray, who was born in Alberta, went to University of Guelph and who worked in Vancouver, was a distinguished engineer, a coveted title large tech companies award to senior technologists. The decision will likely cost him more than $1 million in loss of salary and unvested Amazon stock, “not to mention the best job I ever had,” he said. Amazon has been fighting the spread of coronavirus cases in its logistics network and a public-relations battle against critics who say the company hasn’t done enough to make warehouses safe. Small groups of workers at facilities around the U.S. have walked off the job in protest, and an employee activist group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, called for corporate employees to call in sick after two of its members were fired.Amazon has said the workers were fired for violating corporate policy forbidding them from speaking publicly about internal matters. The company declined to comment on Bray’s resignation.

Bray, who last year signed the employee group’s open letter urging Amazon to do more to fight climate change, said he raised concerns about the firings internally. Having done that, he said, “remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned.”

 He said he believed both that Amazon was making massive investments to keep workers safe during the pandemic, and that workers who have spoken out have legitimate concerns. In the essay, Bray said the company was treating warehouse workers like “fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.” He chalked up some of what he sees as Amazon’s failings to its success in a capitalist system not set up incentivize good treatment of workers.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward, Bray wrote.Don’t say it can’t be done, because France is doing it.”“Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets,” Bray wrote. “It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”Bray, whose last day was Friday, said that Amazon Web Services, the division he worked for, treated workers humanely and “is by and large an ethical organization.”Bloomberg.com"

And those who are eligible must show at least a 70 per cent drop in revenue compared with pre-virus times.Cooper said his companies would try to use the program. “But in the meantime, people have paid April’s rent, tomorrow’s May 1, so there’s a lot of confusion,” he said. “Hopefully it will work out over time, but it won’t be working out smoothly.”Dream Office REIT holds a portfolio of office buildings with about 6 million square feet of space, the majority of it in downtown Toronto.

Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year’s event will likely lack “the celebratory feel that it had in the past.”There’s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown.

OccidentalBuffett’s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental’s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire’s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW’s Shields.“I certainly don’t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, ‘Hey, this is expensive, but it’s got this great ringing endorsement,’ because that’s not how it’s working out,” Shields said.Berkshire’s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Insurance ClaimsChubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers’ compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire’s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers’ compensation insurance.“It’s so different based on the insurance product line,” Shields said. “There are some lines that have major questions,” especially with business-interruption coverage.Succession QuestionsBuffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire’s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire’s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year’s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year’s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.“It’s really, really important,” Shields said. While there’s no indication that any change would happen now, “at some point in time, it’s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it’s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.”Pandemic FalloutCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See’s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF’s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn’t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire’s breadth — with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations — gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.“Buffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,” Cook said.Bloomberg.com"

The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board.

“There’s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,” said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn’t received the letter. “I can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,” Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.

“The Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck’s management,” Sheila Murray, Teck’s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.Stock PlungeThe activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company’s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because “enough is enough,” Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca’s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world’s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn’t working with other investors. Teck’s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Management MovesLast year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn’t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck’s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.“There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,” the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years 
 
Teck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada’s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.“I don’t see this as a ‘Keevils or nothing’ issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,” Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.ESG PushThe hedge fund’s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn’t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund’s investments are in oil transportation and service providers. The metallurgical coal produced by Teck is used mainly for steel making and not for burning in power plants.Even so, it believes that cutting off oil and coal would attract the rising pool of pension funds and family offices that are restricting their investments in companies based on their environmental impact.“You can either do something now and see a material upside or you can continue to de-rate and be an orphan stock in the global materials universe,” Cleary said.Bloomberg.com"

This is not democratic, this is not freedom,” the chief executive officer said after reporting Tesla’s first-ever profit to start a year. “Give people back their goddamn freedom.”Tesla is worried about being able to resume production in the San Francisco Bay area, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May. The Model 3 maker’s only assembly plant in the U.S. still produces the majority of the company’s cars and has been idle since March 23.Investors shrugged off the outburst, with Tesla shares finishing the late trading session up 8.7 per cent. The company’s third straight quarterly profit and revenue of almost US$6 billion both beat analysts’ estimates, extending an advance for a stock that’s already the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year.

Elon Musk and Tesla bulls are so over this COVID-19 panic
“It was vintage Elon. I wish he hadn’t done it,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “But most investors don’t care. It doesn’t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.”The stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.“It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,” Tesla said in its quarterly update. “Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.”During the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to “comfortably” exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.“Gross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. “On the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn’t talk about demand at all.”Tesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla’s semi truck again to 2021 — roughly two years later than initially planned — as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.“Tesla investors are looking past the June quarter,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. “The bulls could take this and run.”Bloomberg.com"

U.S. Federal Reserve holds rate, warns of hardship caused by coronavirus: Read the official statement
Officials Wednesday left unchanged their vague guidance on the future path of rates. The statement repeated language from March 15 saying the committee would keep the benchmark target range near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”U.S. stocks held gains after the Fed’s statement while yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged up slightly to 0.62 per cent.Regarding asset purchases, the FOMC used wording similar to last month, saying the buying of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will continue “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.”Time frame extendedWednesday’s statement acknowledged the extent and breadth of the damage being wraught by the ongoing contagion.“The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world,” the committee said. “The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.”It made specific mention of lower oil prices and their role in holding down inflation.Policy makers also began to extend cautiously the time frame within which they see the economic blow from the virus lasting, though they are still offering no precise forecast.Medium Term“The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,” the committee said.The central bank has mounted an unprecedented push to limit the economic harm of the virus, which has plunged the global economy into recession and likely sent U.S. unemployment well above 10% after businesses shuttered to slow the contagion.Government data released earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 4.8 per cent rate in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank’s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed’s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"

The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"

Oanh Ha,Legal jargon on cruise tickets may foil class-action suits,"‘If you print out one of these tickets, it's like 20 pages of gobbledygook. Most people have no idea the limitations they're presented with’",https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/legal-jargon-on-cruise-tickets-may-foil-virus-class-action-suits,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cruise.jpg,"April 29, 2020 5:01 AM EDT","After two passengers on their luxury cruise tested positive for Covid-19 in March, Emilio and Barbara Hernandez were so frantic to get off the ship, they wrote a note to the captain.The Costa Luminosa sailed on with them still onboard, and they ended up with the virus. Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers’ lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits – lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That’s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that’s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.“These claims are enormous – nothing the industry’s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,” said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry’s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn’t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes’ case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an “uphill battle,” Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers’ tickets. “Provided that’s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.”Range of ProtectionsIt’s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.“If you print out one of these tickets, it’s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. “Most people have no idea the limitations they’re presented with.”For example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it’s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines “took immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,” said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. “Importantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes’ tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a “patently unfair” prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged “significant hurdles” for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted “intentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus” for which there’s no vaccine.If the case isn’t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs’ law firms that pursue them do so on a “no win, no fee” basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.Suits’ Allegations“The ship never should have sailed,” Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. “They put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.”He and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship’s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was “not even connected to any flu-like symptoms,” said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator’s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes’ cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship’s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn’t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik’s office said it’s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak “has focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.” She said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival’s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they “may have been exposed.” It was then – two weeks after the voyage began – that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company’s response was reasonable under the circumstances. “This is a generational global event — it’s unprecedented,” he said.Inspections QuestionedBefore the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there’d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers’ experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn’t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes’ lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival’s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean’s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships “typically perform extremely well” during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven’t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. “There are still a lot of ifs” about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.“The industry hasn’t had any calamitous losses – nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,” Klein said.  Bloomberg.com"

Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open. In Canada, Cargill Inc. has idled its beef plant in High River, Alberta, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s processing capacity while JBS SA’s beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, is running at about half capacity.Quebec-based Goodfood Market Corp., which delivers meals on a subscription basis, said it will be substituting its regular boneless chicken for bone-in thighs, legs and drumsticks as the poultry industry shifts away from de-boning to ramp up production.

“Poultry suppliers are still facing labour shortages and many of them are operating with less than 50 per cent of their regular workforce,” Goodfood Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ferrari wrote in an email to customers. “To ensure the essential supply of chicken for Canadians across the country, the poultry industry as a whole is shifting away from de-boning chicken legs to increase their production capacity.”Ferrari also wrote that the company is working to secure a frozen beef supply in case shutdowns at Alberta’s beef suppliers disrupt the supply chain.

New Meat SelectionGrocers generally are accepting cuts of meat that require more cutting by their in-house butchers to keep their meat counters as full as possible, said Michael Young, president of Canada Beef.Meat such as sirloin and strip loins that would have typically been sent to restaurants before the pandemic shuttered businesses are now increasingly sold by retailers who are offering them in different sizes to get the price point down, he said. Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called “end cuts” from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks — from the leg of a cow — on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Larger PackagesConsumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill’s protein and salt businesses. While the company’s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.“We know they’re buying cuts that they’ve never bought before,” Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there’s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors’ Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said. A lot more ground meat is typically sold by comparison, which causes an imbalance.“We’re just waiting to see if enough has changed to eat our way out of the problem,” Allen said.Bloomberg.com"

The video is followed by an explanation in English and Spanish. Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world’s largest online retailer. A vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease’s spread within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it’s safe to show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon’s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off — no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon’s efforts echo what’s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic.

Amazon hasn’t said how many of its workers took unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon’s new safety procedures firsthand. Employees who feel they can’t return because they’re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She’s since returned. “I would have stayed home again if they didn’t make the changes they have,” she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is “providing flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” a spokeswoman said in an email. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.” The company said it doesn’t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.

The coronavirus first struck Amazon’s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus’s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company’s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building’s top manager wasn’t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn’t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn’t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it’s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor — ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they’re being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a hallway.

Despite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon’s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. “We have full shifts in all departments, but it’s seasonal workers,” said Jaylen Camp, who works at a facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. “It’s all new people surrounding me daily,” said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week New York’s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing protective gear. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse.         View this post on Instagram           Today's visits by our founder and CEO @JeffBezos to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and @WholeFoods employees.

A post shared by  Amazon (@amazon) on Apr 8, 2020 at 9:05pm PDTSome employees wonder how Amazon will safely accommodate returnees in buildings rearranged to separate workstations and keep people from congregating. Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren’t eligible. An Amazon spokeswoman later said the decision had been reversed.Other employees plan to return to work. One worker at a warehouse in Connecticut, who decided to work part-time as cases spread nearby, said she can’t afford to lose the paycheque. “Everyone thinks it’s just about sick people staying home, but it’s more than that,” she said. “My kids aren’t in school. The unpaid time basically meant that I’ve had a flexible schedule which has allowed me to do what I need to for my girls.”Bloomberg.com"

He didn’t elaborate.

The order, though, will not be limited to Tyson, the person said. It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump’s order sets the stage for a showdown between America’s meat giants, who’ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who’ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products 
 
The White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down. Meat stocks rose on the news.But a union representing plant workers accused the administration of failing to develop meaningful safety requirements that would have helped contain the disruptions.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” said Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.‘Breaking’ Supply ChainTyson Foods extended gains, jumping as much as 5.6 per cent for the biggest intraday advance in three weeks. Hormel Foods Corp. rose 1 per cent, while JBS SA’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.6 per cent.On Sunday, Tyson Foods Chairman John Tyson said in a blog post that the U.S. food supply chain “is breaking,” with millions of pounds of meat set to “disappear” as plants close.Illnesses in the meat-processing industry and shifts in demand after restaurants closed have disrupted the supply chain. Dairy farmers are dumping milk that can’t be sold to processors, broiler operations have been breaking eggs to reduce supplies and some fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields amid labor and distribution disruptions.

Many low-income Americans, meanwhile, have been waiting in long lines at food banks, which have reported shortages.Asked about the country’s food supply, Trump said: “There’s plenty of supply.”The Defense Production Act allows the government broad power to direct industrial production in crises. Trump has previously invoked the law — or threatened to invoke it — in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa’s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities “as soon as it is possible to do so safely.” Iowa produces one-third of the nation’s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Sick WorkersAcross the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with “depopulation and disposal methods” for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African swine fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs.Bloomberg.com"

The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers — a sign of just how distorted the market has become.

The spectre of production shut-downs — and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies — was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It’s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.“We are moving into the end-game,” Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. “Early-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.”In theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it’s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameTorbjorn Tornqvist 
 
The best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.“Monday really focused people’s minds that production needs to slow down,” Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. “It’s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.”Trafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. “The severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,” said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.

North Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state’s total.The output cuts won’t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.“I wouldn’t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,” Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. “In certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.”In emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that’s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it’s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What’s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.

Before the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.Refiners ShutBut before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate. U.S. oil refiners processed just 12.45 million barrels a day on the week to April 17, the lowest amount in at least 30 years, except for hurricane-related closures.More refinery shutdowns are coming, oil traders and consultants said, particularly in the U.S. where lockdowns started later than in Europe and demand is still contracting. Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, said that global refineries could halt as much as 25 per cent of total capacity in May.“No one is going to be able to dodge this bullet.”Bloomberg.com"

The fund said it’s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn’t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold “significant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.”

The ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it’s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.“While it is USO’s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,” it said in the filing, adding that USO investors “should expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO’s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.”Easy TargetThe US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn’t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including “a change in regulator accountability levels and position limits” as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that’s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that’s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"

Malls and main-street shops, bastions of community commerce, were already under pressure after two years of weak retail sales, rising property taxes and the shift to e-commerce.

Much will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country’s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country’s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can’t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That’s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.“To be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive — I would guess that some of the ones that won’t survive maybe weren’t in such good shape when this started,” he said in an April 21 interview. “Where we think the tenant should be able to survive, we’re certainly open to discussing further help.”Still he’s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.“Once people feel safe and comfortable — and that may be a full year before we’re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer — I think people will go back to their basic habits,” Sonshine said. “They want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym — all of which nobody can do right now.”Bloomberg.com"

Whoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that’s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada’s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank’s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.

“You need someone forceful,” Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “There does have to be some push back.”The outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today’s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons — the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada’s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank’s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that’s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion — a gap that’s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulMark Chandler 
 
With the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada’s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada’s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. “Someday the tensions will ease back and we won’t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,” the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts.

They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They’re stress baking, but they’re also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.‘Health Halo’Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.

It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago — packaged foods in particular have been given new life.“Traditionally, food has a comforting role,” Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world’s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.

“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”Bloomberg.com"

Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers’ digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu — or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province’s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe’s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon’s dominance.

“People will be able to see what’s available in their region,” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. “There’s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.”Quebec’s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company’s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.“There’s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,” Lecours said. “Still, let’s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it’s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?”Efforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch — including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.’s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV’s beer.

When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer — an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.“An initiative to promote local commerce isn’t an initiative against free trade,” Fitzgibbon said then. “It’s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.”The Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn’t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it’s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the “Buy Quebec” movement to stay.“No one can compete with Amazon,” she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don’t sell on the behemoth’s platform, “we have some exclusivity they don’t have.”‘I Made No Money’Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.’s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling “Black Friday level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault’s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.“I made no money,” he said. Shipping costs “is what’s hurting everyone.”Taillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket’s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers’ attention.“Our goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,” he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, “it will have been worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Brazil, the world’s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.“It’s absolutely unprecedented,” said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. “It’s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.”

New U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin.

The most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.“During this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation’s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,” Smithfield said in a statement Friday. “It’s an awful choice; it’s not one we wish on anyone.”Prices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike’s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.“We’re backing it up already because of the coming — we feel — the coming shortages,” said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven’t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn’t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn’t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there’s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don’t have a place to sell their animals. That’s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It’s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That’s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on “depopulation and disposal methods.”

It’s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling — so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as “elbow-to-elbow.” Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there’s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day — it’s basically the opposite of social distancing.Sick InspectorsAt the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That’s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there’s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS’s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant “are fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.” The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that “employee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.”The closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.“Brazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don’t see progress in agglomeration of people,” said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. “They are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Esteban Duarte,Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces,Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government — which could trigger a downgrade,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg,"April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT","Canada’s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country’s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada’s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada’s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days.

How to help the provinces weather the COVID-19 economic shock
Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.“There is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point” for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.A ‘Weak’ AAACanadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada’s profile as similar to Australia — whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 — and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada’s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.“The fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low — I think that will be very important for the credit rating,” said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada’s top credit rating as “extremely resilient,” citing the central government’s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is “among the weak” AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn’t an automatic trigger for a credit action.Implicit SupportWhile the federal government doesn’t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador’s rating of A1 by Moody’s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of “a high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,” Moody’s said in an April 1 statement. Moody’s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It’s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.“We still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.“Oil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,” said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That’s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.“Provincials are absolutely key for Canada’s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,” said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces’ credit ratings may be “called into question.”Bloomberg.com"

The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems — chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls — after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel’s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"

That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett’s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. “We’ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won’t reopen when this is over,” he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.“There’s no fortress that’s immune to that right now,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book “Margin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.”Some Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See’s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire’s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett’s promise that Berkshire will “forever remain a financial fortress” hasn’t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.“It’s nowhere near business as usual, of course,” he said in an interview. “But keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there’s a coronavirus pandemic.”Schnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he’s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn’t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.’s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire’s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett’s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren’t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this “typhoon,” Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire’s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett’s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett’s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Buffett has yet to announce a similar deal recently, shareholder Thomas Russo said Buffett’s ability to evaluate unique opportunities may help again.“He’s patient,” said Russo, who oversees about US$10 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo & Gardner. “One of the best features is that he is able to see opportunities broadly.”Buffett, 89, is set to host a virtual version of Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, an event that normally draws thousands of visitors to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Investors hope he’ll have the “washtub” that he described in his 2017 annual letter:“Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold,” Buffett wrote. “When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.”Bloomberg.com"

Ottawa planning rent relief program for smaller businesses
The federal government has stepped up aid to businesses, introducing measures such as a 75 per cent wage subsidy and $40,000 loans, and a rent relief program is expected soon. But the measures weren’t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren’t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government’s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.“The bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that’s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,” Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Take ‘Months’Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. “It’s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.”And if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.“It doesn’t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,” Yussuff said. “This is a very difficult time so workers don’t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.”Bloomberg.com"

After some discussion, the client agreed to put the piece of jewelry up for auction at the major spring sale at Sotheby’s New York, which was supposed to be held in late April.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Live auctions were called off, and Sotheby’s pivoted to online sales. With global economies faltering, U.S. equity markets whipsawing, and people stuck at home indefinitely, the success of online jewelry sales was far from certain. Becket called the bracelet’s owner “and told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale or deferred to a live auction at a later date.”But to Becket’s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well — very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. “Clients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,” she says. Some, Becket adds, told her “they’re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.”Everyone, she says, “is waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.”The results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby’s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.“What we’re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,” Becket says, “and actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.” A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of £90,000 (US$110,000) sold for £162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for £50,000, above a high estimate of £32,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that “I could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we’d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.” The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.Investment PotentialThe rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.“Polished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,” Rapaport wrote, while “shipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel’s plummeted by 73 per cent.” Meanwhile, “inventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.”If buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.“I don’t think people were buying for the sake of investment,” Becket says. “We had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.” It’s true, she continues, that “there has been a softening” in the auction market for jewelry as the value of loose stones has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.“The Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,” she explains. “The stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,” because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. “So the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.”A Million Dollars, Sight UnseenNow the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost a million dollars on a bracelet they’ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says, people are most willing to buy things with which they’re familiar: a Cartier “Love” bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a “broadening” of what’s done well at auction. “A multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn’t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,” she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers’ willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.“If these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,” she says, “where people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.”Bloomberg.com"

Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is “somewhat surprising” given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company’s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify’s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not “necessarily equate to sales volume.”A likely recession, “if we’re not in one already,” will inevitably see a downturn in sales as “no one is immune” to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify’s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify’s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada’s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"

The strong demand comes at a time of supply disruptions as food makers adapt to dramatic shifts in buying patterns and some processing plants close as workers fall ill. As a result, stores are restricting purchases to prevent items from vanishing from shelves. For shoppers, that can be unnerving.“It’s not a shortage, it’s just that it needs to get from the supplier throughout the supply chain to the stores,” said Diane Brisebois, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Council of Canada. “There’s been an unexpected increase in demand for those products, and if those demands continue, it might take a bit longer to get them to the shelves.”

Overall, there’s enough retail supply, said Heather Garlich, a spokesperson for FMI, a food industry association that represents retailers and producers.But there have been “sporadic challenges” with high-demand products, and 49 per cent of U.S. shoppers report their supermarket has had products out of stock, according to the industry’s tracking. On popular items, “they could consider limits based on where the grocer may be located and when their supplier or wholesalers can get them product,” Garlich said.The dizzying variety of foods on grocery shelves has long been a trademark of North American supermarkets. That’s now changing, leaving shoppers worried. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus to making more of just a few core products, which makes it easier for retailers to restock supplies.

“The thing I’m struck by, in the U.S., we’re so used to walking down a supermarket aisle and having thousands of choices,” said Heidi Heitkamp, a former North Dakota Senator and current member of alliantgroup’s strategic advisory board. “Now that’s not what people see on the shelves and it’s a little unnerving. But what everyone should be grateful for is that you can walk into any supermarket in a major metro area and you can find food to eat. That’s a critically important national security concern.”There are signs that panic buying is waning and shoppers are returning to more traditional patterns. U.S. packaged food sales rose 24 per cent in the week ended April 4 from a year ago, slowing from a gain of 32 per cent a week earlier, according to data compiled by Nielsen. Limits on the number of visitors per store are also affecting sales.Costco Wholesale Corp.’s sales rose in March but not as much as expected. Limits placed on its operations to cope with coronavirus-related demand slowed growth in the back half of the month.

“I honestly think rationing may disappear at some point over the next few weeks because expectations have changed a little bit,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “People have come to accept what’s happening right now.”And while meat aisles remain stocked, the spread of coronavirus among North American slaughterhouses is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores. The shutdown of major U.S. processing plants, including Tyson Foods Inc.’s Waterloo plant in Iowa this week, means more than 15 per cent of the nation’s hog-slaughtering capacity is down.“Once we see the impact of workers testing positive in the packing plants, we’re going to see a shortage of meat,” said Heitkamp, the former senator.Bloomberg.com"

But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last quarter.“No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages and post-production) will play out,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie “Klaus,” and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It’s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can’t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix “The Lovebirds,” a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things” fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can’t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What’s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That’s why Netflix has minimized the impact of rival studios pulling popular programs like “The Office” and “Friends.”Bloomberg.com"

Detached homes fell 4.6 per cent, dropping just below $1 million.“The state of emergency measures currently in place, including the necessary enforcement of social distancing, has impacted the real estate market in many ways,” TRREB President Michael Collins said in the statement. “Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and indeed their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction.”Home sales declines will likely be steepest in the second quarter as social-distancing measures remain in place for most of the spring, said TRREB. The real estate group forecasts that average prices for the year will likely remain near 2019 levels.“As we recover from this temporary downturn, potentially later this year, home buyers will move off the sidelines in increasing numbers as they satisfy pent-up demand for ownership housing,” said the board’s chief market analyst, Jason Mercer. “Increasingly, these buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the onset of COVID-19.”Bloomberg.com"

The oil market continued to hold investor attention, with Brent crude slumping to a two-decade low before rebounding. American crude surged above US$13 a barrel after President Donald Trump ordered the navy to destroy any Iranian gun boats that harass American ships at sea. The main U.S. oil ETF announced a reverse share split to buoy its flagging price.Investors are continuing efforts to assess the pandemic’s damage to the global economy, with the oil market chaos suggesting it will be deeper or longer than anticipated by those who drove the S&P 500 up 28 per cent from its March lows. Governments are devising ways to return people to work even as they discover infections are more extensive than they insisted only weeks ago.

Netflix forecasts 7.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter — a great quarter under normal circumstances. But investors, who sent the stock to new highs this week, may have wanted more. Though they initially bid Netflix shares up as much as 12% after the close Tuesday, the rally soon fizzled. The stock was little changed as of 5:38 p.m. in New York.“Like other home-entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth,” the company said in a letter to investors. “We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.”

Netflix heard the complaints: You can now turn off that annoying autoplay
How many people really are watching ‘The Mandalorian’? Data firms offer numbers that Disney and Netflix won’t
While COVID-19 has been devastating to the global economy, video-streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have found a captive audience. The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.“What we’re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,” said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter’s results reflected two of Netflix’s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as “The Irishman” and “The Two Popes,” Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. “Tiger King,” about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since “Stranger Things,” according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, “Love Is Blind,” a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, “Too Hot to Handle,” has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally — even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday’s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.“I understand the caution around the response to the stock,” Grous said, before adding, “But we’re not focused too much on quarter to quarter. We’re thinking about the long-term trend here, and that is explosive growth.”Bloomberg.com"

A massive supply glut brought on by the pandemic and a worldwide shortage of storage space have touched off an relentless rout that has shifted the entire forward curve for oil.The meltdown spreading across global oil markets has already wiped out tens of thousands of jobs and frozen billions of dollars in capital spending. Its deflationary effect threatens to further cripple economies around the world already reeling from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers have become overwhelmed by a vast oversupply brought on by an unprecedented plunge in global fuel demand.Oil is a “dangerous market to trade in right now,” said Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP, in a Bloomberg TV interview. The market needs oil production to fall immediately for prices to recover, he said.The price crash spilled into the ETF market, with the biggest crude-tracking fund, the United States Oil Fund LP, moving some of its WTI contracts into later months, according to a regulatory filing. The June/July WTI spread rallied more than US$1 a barrel on the move.Oil Ministers from the OPEC+ coalition held an unscheduled conference call on Tuesday to discuss the collapse without settling on new policy measures. The Texas Railroad Commission, meanwhile, opted to put off a decision on whether to impose oil-production quotas.In London, the immediate contract for Brent crude was at the biggest discount to the following month in data since 2008. U.S. marker WTI’s June contract was halted three times early in New York to manage the volatility, CME Group Inc. said.“If you start to look at the actual supply-demand situation for oil, it’s not so obvious that by the time those contracts expire, the storage situation around Cushing will be very different than what it is in May,” said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “The prices of these futures will need to connect to the physical reality, and they are likely to crack lower.”WTI for June dropped 43 per cent to US$11.57 a barrel in New York. The thinly traded May contract closed at US$10.01 a barrel.Brent crude futures for June slumped 24 per cent to close at US$19.33 a barrel.The collapse is reverberating across the oil industry, with prices trading below zero across America on Monday. WTI Midland in Texas — a flagship marker for the U.S. shale industry — was at -US$13.13 a barrel, while crude in Alaska was at -$US46.63.There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up. Royal Vopak NV, the world’s biggest independent storage company, said almost all of its space is sold.Crude stockpiles at Cushing — America’s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract — have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. U.S. nationwide inventories are estimated to have increased another 14 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Dated Brent benchmark, a global reference for nearly two thirds of the world’s physical flows, plunged to US$13.24 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since 1999, according to price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. That means that key European and African crude streams, including Urals from Russia and Bonny Light from Nigeria, would sell now under $10 a barrel, as they trade at a discount to the Dated Brent benchmark.Bloomberg.com"

But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.The US$4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker USO) slumped about 11 per cent to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32 per cent to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.USO didn’t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract’s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.“Additional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be ‘lights out’ as a partnership and could actually ‘owe’ money,” writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product’s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund’s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. “However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,” according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.“There has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,” she said. “Unclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we’re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.”In the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called “acceleration events” that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"

In Canada’s energy capital, they’re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and “a huge crater” in local government finances. 
Alberta’s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility
Anxiety mounts among Albertans as province faces ‘profound adversity’ not seen since the 1930s
What will our post-pandemic energy future look like? It could very well be a brave new world
It’s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada’s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade’s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market’s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there’s an epic glut. Net asking rents — what the landlord receives — for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America’s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Boom, Bust, BustFour buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China’s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.“The office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,” said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.

Canada’s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers’ ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time 
 
“There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,” said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar’s director of market analytics for Canada. “Whereas now, it’s been bust for a long time.” His firm sees the city’s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.“It’s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they’re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,” Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn’t survive or deserted their leased space.Unemployment RisingThe crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary’s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil’s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary’s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.

Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that’s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar’s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.“The question is, ‘Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?’” Van Dijk said. “Whether it’s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s reduced the output of wood chips that pulp mills rely on to make everything from toilet paper and wipes to cardboard boxes and paper bags, said Derek Nighbor, president and chief executive officer of the Ottawa-based Forest Products Association of Canada.Without federal aid to get some sawmill capacity back on line, input costs could rise or there could be a shortage of the materials pulp mills need for household products, he said. Panic buying has already caused shortages of toilet paper and other hygiene products in supermarkets around the world.

“The demand from pulp mills has gone up at a time when we’re starting to see the chip supply become more scarce from the sawmills,” Nighbor said in a telephone interview. “It could drive the cost up or there could be product constraints for sure in the months ahead.”High production costs in Canada squeezed profits for sawmills. The U.S. housing market remains under pressure as the coronavirus spreads, and lumber futures plunged a record 32 per cent in March.The industry is optimistic that Canada’s government can tweak its wage subsidy program to help forest operators qualify and bolster their access to cash to help them survive the coming quarters, Nighbor said. Canada exports the bulk of its pulp, paper and packaging products and the U.S. is one of its major markets, he said.“We’re in a crisis here,” Nighbor said. “We need more of our sawmills running.”Bloomberg.com"

A deal for Caltex Australia would have marked the largest acquisition in the country this year as well as the third-biggest in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The current situation in the world is highly uncertain,” Couche-Tard said in a statement. “The COVID-19 crisis is first and foremost a human tragedy that has impacted millions of people and has also been meaningfully disruptive to economies and businesses around the world, including the Australian fuel and convenience retail industries.”

The Canadian company said it continues to see Caltex Australia as a “strong strategic fit” and plans to re-engage “once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook.” Matthew Halliday, Caltex Australia’s interim chief executive officer, said in an interview that the company has a “reasonably strong” balance sheet and continues to explore an initial public offering or trade sale for its property assets.Shares of Caltex Australia plummeted as much as 9.1 per cent in Sydney on Monday. The stock dropped 7.8 per cent at close, while the country’s benchmark index S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.5 per cent .Couche-Tard’s dropout could shift the focus to bids by other parties including the closely-held EG Group. The U.K.-based company in February offered to pay A$3.9 billion in cash for Caltex’s retail outlets along with shares in a new listed company made up of the remaining fuel refining operations. However, Caltex’s board rejected EG’s bid a month later.Caltex Australia, which has a network of about 2,000 retail fuel sites, hasn’t received any updates since then, Halliday said in the interview on Monday.“It’s fair to say everyone is focused on managing their way through the current situation,” the interim CEO said. “EG remains a very significant customer of ours, so we talk to EG all the time but no meaningful update from a transactional point of view.”Couche-Tard, owner of convenience stores operating under brands including Circle K, first offered to acquire Caltex Australia in October and sweetened its offer a month later to A$34.50 cash per share. Caltex Australia rejected the A$8.6 billion offer but gave the Canadian firm “selected non-public information” for a revised proposal. In February, Couche-Tard boosted its offer for a second time to A$8.8 billion, which is equivalent to A$35.25 apiece in cash.A plunge in oil prices and coronavirus-induced curbs on travel added uncertainty to the business outlook for both Couche-Tard and Caltex Australia. Due diligence for the deal was completed last week, though Halliday said the Canadian convenience-store giant didn’t table a final price.On Monday, Caltex reported an A$29 million net loss for the first quarter, following an earlier announcement that it would extend the maintenance shutdown of its Lytton refinery in Queensland as well as disclosing that its convenience shop sale levels were flat compared to 2019. The company has said it expects jet fuel demand in Australia to drop by as much as 90% as the country’s airlines slash their schedules.Couche-Tard indicated that any deal could be concluded quickly if revived.“We remain convinced of the long-term financial and strategic merits of an acquisition of Caltex and all the benefits it would offer to the shareholders of both companies,” Couche-Tard Chief Executive Officer Brian Hannasch said in the statement. “Our current plan would be to re-engage the process once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook, and the work done to date should mean that we will be able to quickly formalize our proposal at that time.”Bloomberg.com"

Australia, for example, said last month all foreign takeovers will need government approval, no matter how small.Canada will leave the enhanced measures in place until the economy recovers from the pandemic, according to the policy statement.The shutdown of non-essential businesses and social distancing measures to curb the spread of the virus has brought the Canadian economy to a near halt and caused company values to plummet.

The government has received a total of 6.2 million unique applications under the two benefit programs since March 16, the government official said.The government’s flagship program for business — a wage subsidy of 75 per cent — is worth a much larger $73 billion (US$50 billion) over a 12 week period, and is expected to start within a few weeks.The government estimates direct spending programs will cost a total of $107 billion by June, representing just less then 5 per cent of economic output. The government’s plan provides at least another $155-billion worth of business credit and temporary tax deferrals.Bloomberg.com"

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada’s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What’s more, its households are among the world’s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.

“I think it is the Great Reckoning,” says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. “We’ve been in a period for so long where it didn’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.”Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. “Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?” asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. “Where exactly do we draw the line?”A ‘Flammable’ MarketThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada’s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there’s not much that can pick up the slack — certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven’t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer — they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.

That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It’s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city’s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up — “Don’t use your house like an ATM” — as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted 
 
Today, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 — a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt — an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country’s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.“You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,” says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. “And this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.”Airbnb Customers VanishIt doesn’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That’s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.

Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada’s Airbnb hosts — who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 — need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.“It’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter’s grandchildren aren’t even going to be able to pay this off,” says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. “What’s the plan after?”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said the online retail giant is developing COVID-19 testing capabilities as a first step toward a system of regular checks on its employees globally.In an annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire founder outlined other steps the e-commerce giant has taken to curb the coronavirus, from shutting down non-essential services like Amazon Books to overhauling processes at Whole Foods. The next step was regular testing for all staff — including those who showed no symptoms, he said. On Thursday, Bezos said his company had assembled a team comprising scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its first testing lab soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” Bezos said in the letter, which offers a rare window into the thinking of the world’s richest man and his plans for the company he founded. Bezos in recent years has rarely done media interviews or commented publicly on events.

Bezos also reiterated previous company announcements that Amazon has distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at facilities around the world. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company was crowding together would-be recruits at job fairs — flouting official guidelines urging people to stay at least six feet apart. In the letter, Bezos said: “We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.”Bezos, as is his custom, included in his note a copy of his 1997 letter to shareholders. It’s a way of reminding his audience that Amazon’s strategy of prioritizing long-term thinking and customer satisfaction over short-term profits has paid off handsomely for investors.Last year, Bezos used his annual letter to advance an argument that Amazon’s growth had benefited third-party merchants that sell on its site. The comments were widely interpreted as a rejoinder to critics who say Amazon has amassed too much market power and should be broken up.Bloomberg.com"

Assuming they pass, they’ll move inside to greet their supervisors behind plexiglass wickets and slather themselves with hand sanitizer.The new safety measures — a sampling from a 20-page list of COVID-19 requirements, according to Chief Executive Officer Sean Boyd — become most challenging as the workers enter the giant elevator for a 45 minute trip that takes them three kilometres underground.“Normally in the cage you’re jammed in there like sardines,” Boyd said in an interview Tuesday. “We’ve reduced the capacity in the cage by more than 50 per cent.

But with 6 million people seeking income support in the face of an unprecedented economic slump, pressure is building among the country’s provinces for a return to work. The effort will likely be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks — and it will be months, if not longer, before the country is running anywhere near capacity.

Quebec, the province with 52 per cent of the country’s cases and 44 per cent of its deaths, took an initial step this week by making mining and home construction priority sectors, enabling their return to business. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has struck a cabinet committee to craft a recovery plan, while British Columbia may reveal more details this week on potential ways to consider relaxing some social-distancing restrictions.“We don’t want to add a housing crisis on top of the current crisis,” Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Monday during a daily press briefing, in explaining why the province has changed its mind about construction.Following ChinaOn both sides of the border, regional governments are keen to control what reopens first and when. In Canada, provinces have control over many economic policies as well as public services from education to health. California and some of America’s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has “total” authority to reopen the world’s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is “coordinating” his country’s response.“We are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,” he said a news conference in Ottawa. “We recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We’re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we’re going to reopen the economy. It’s just that it’s going to be a while still.”Discussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillJustin Trudeau 
 
In Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company’s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company’s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.“We can’t be locked down forever,” she said in a phone interview. “The virus will still be around us. It won’t be eradicated so it’s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.”Any return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Cautious StepsDr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions “to get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,” but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak’s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.“We will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,” Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back onlineFrances Donald

The company has 900 permanent staff at the LaRonde mine.“It will be gradual and if we see things that we’re uncomfortable with, clearly we won’t go forward with it.”Bloomberg.com"

Occidental had been paying cash since Buffett invested US$10 billion last year to help fund the company’s US$37 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., demanding an 8 per cent annual dividend.Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub survived a bitter 10-month campaign by Icahn to seize control of the company by granting him board seats and corporate governance changes. But as the COVID-19 pandemic destroys demand for crude and strips producers of cash, her most immediate challenge is to tackle the debt pile Occidental accrued last year to beat Chevron Corp. in the bidding war for Anadarko.

With US$11 billion of debt due by 2022, Occidental is looking for any and all possible ways to save cash after being downgraded to junk last month. It has slashed employees’ pay, reduced its regular dividend to common shareholders for the first time in 30 years and asked workers to appeal for government financial aid for the oil industry.Occidental’s share registration doesn’t mean Berkshire and its affiliates will necessarily sell any stock, according to the filing Wednesday. It’s unclear whether Berkshire will eventually sell down its common stock stake in the oil producer, has already chipped away at that holding in recent months, or might buy more shares. Berkshire was Occidental’s ninth biggest common shareholder at Dec. 31, with a 2.1 per cent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While Buffett has been known to keep some of his investments for decades, he’s also been willing to trim stakes at times. Recently, his Omaha, Nebraska-based company sold some shares in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as the coronavirus ravaged the airline industry.Occidental is the second-worst performing member of the S&P 500 Energy Index since its interest in Anadarko became known a year ago, plunging 79 per cent in that span, while the index fell 51 per cent.Occidental declined 12 per cent at 11:44 a.m. in New York, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 3.1 per cent to US$19.50 a barrel.The Occidental bet was one of Buffett’s largest deals in recent years and mimicked some of the famous financial crisis-era moves that allowed him to get preferred stock in companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The transaction allowed Buffett to deploy a large sum of his cash pile and accrue generous dividends.Buffett has been struggling in recent years to find attractive ways to deploy his cash, which was close to a record US$128 billion at the end of last year. The billionaire investor noted in his annual report that Occidental’s dividends on his preferred stock could be paid in cash or in shares of the oil producer.Berkshire didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment sent to Buffett’s assistant.

It’s not just the billionaires. Corporate insiders have been significant buyers of their companies’ shares, a show of confidence that the crisis will pass, even as the nation’s leaders debate exactly when Americans can safely return to work.The volume of transactions in beaten-down industries, from travel to health care to gaming, suggests executives and directors are more bullish than they’ve been at most other points in the past decade, according to Sundial Capital Research.The wealth gap, it’s only going to get wider with what’s going on nowMatt Maley 
 
Carnival Corp. board member Randall Weisenburger bought US$10 million of stock in the beleaguered cruise-line operator last week. The shares have jumped 56 per cent since the purchase.Others are going further to maximize returns. UBS Group AG is seeing ultra-wealthy clients ramp up borrowing to place more wagers in what they see as a cheap market. Mortgage brokers to the rich have said more clients are seeking loans backed by real estate to help them repay other debt, invest in businesses and snap up other assets.There have been massive losers among the moneyed set. Many in the oil and gas industry have been hammered by the collapse in crude prices including wildcatter Harold Hamm, whose fortune is down 64 per cent to US$3.7 billion. Emerging-market billionaires aren’t reaping the same rewards as those in the U.S. and there have been margin calls and forced sales.But there also have been remarkable gains.

Alice, Jim and Rob Walton now have a combined net worth of US$169 billion, up almost 5 per cent since the start of the year.

Leading the group is Bezos, who has added almost US$24 billion to his fortune in 2020, as well as MacKenzie Bezos, who was left with a 4 per cent stake in Amazon as part of the couple’s recent divorce settlement. Her net worth has climbed US$8.2 billion to US$45.3 billion, and she’s now No. 18 on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, ahead of Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person, and Mexico’s Carlos Slim.Shares of rival retailer Walmart Inc. have also advanced, buoying the fortunes of the world’s richest family.

The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.

Why Trudeau should put aside his personal agenda and ask Bank of Canada's Poloz to delay retirement
Canada is at a critical juncture — if we don’t transform our economy then we will face a greater crisis
One thing he’s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada’s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That’s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, “you’d be saying ‘look, we’ve got your back,’” Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province’s debt to buy?Expanding PurchasesThe central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “To do this, they would likely target a ‘zone’ for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,” Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Provide ClarityAustralia’s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the “economic recovery is well underway.” More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"

The news was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper.

“If Bridging were to press existing borrowers out of the portfolio in order to satisfy unusual redemptions in the funds, the effect would be to cut off funding to these businesses during an unprecedented economic emergency,” the firm said in the letter seen by Bloomberg News. It could also result in investors being treated unfairly “if Bridging were to be asked to sell positions at a discount given the lack of a normal market.”The firm said in the letter that many of its borrowers — which work in everything from milling flour to delivering groceries, repairing Coast Guard vessels and monitoring train tracks — are experiencing higher demand for their products as people need more of the basic services they provide.Last month, Sharpe said the firm had a surge in calls from companies desperate for loans. He said at the time that his team was speeding up work to accommodate some of the requests for urgent loans ranging from $10 million to $50 million, he said.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported last month.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately $2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations.”Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corporation have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to the people familiar with the matter.Bloomberg.com"

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockGita Gopinath, IMF's chief economist 
 
While the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF’s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency. 
Advanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs

In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.“This crisis is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. “Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.”As with the virus’s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.“Many countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,” the IMF said. “Risks of a worse outcome predominate.”The grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF’s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that “global growth appears to be bottoming out.” Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund’s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged “more dire scenarios” were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF’s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF’s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries. The program has been pared down to mostly media briefings and private meetings, skipping the typical seminars and public discussions.Bloomberg.com"

Coronavirus-related market gyrations led Tesla shares to drop as much as a 61 per cent from a record high on Feb. 19. The stock has been steadily advancing since the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter deliveries on April 2 and is back to the levels it was trading at in early March.“There is some clear optimism from the bulls,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote to clients on Monday. China production and demand appear poised for a significant rebound and should be a key growth driver over the coming quarter, he said.Even so, it is now a “virtual impossibility” that Tesla will be able to reach its original annual delivery forecast of at least 500,000 units, according to Ives. Bullish investors are also looking past the shutdown of the company’s vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, which could last at least another month, further complicating the delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, he said.Credit Suisse’s Levy also sees Tesla coming up short of its full-year deliveries guidance and is now estimating the company will hand over about 400,000 electric vehicles to customers this year, down from his previous projection for 550,000.While Levy estimates Tesla is burning about US$300 million of cash every week that its Fremont factory is down, he believes the company will emerge from the crisis with advantages over other automakers.“It likely has a lead in batteries, its liquidity is improved and it has shown signs of improvements in basic auto execution,” Levy said.Bloomberg.com"

‘Brutal education’: Inside the mad rush to make masks to battle COVID-19
Last week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a temporary rule that would require all exports of certain masks, gloves and other materials used in the U.S.’s coronavirus response to get “explicit approval” from FEMA.The rule included a single exemption — for covered materials that are made by or on behalf of U.S. manufacturers with continuous export agreements with customers in other countries. And the exemption only applies if at least 80 per cent of that manufacturer’s domestic production was distributed in the U.S. in the past year.Within hours of publishing that rule, FEMA and CBP representatives were flooded with emails and phone calls asking for clarity.Exemption DefinitionsOn a conference call the agencies held last week, companies and their lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rule: What if a multinational firm ships products to one of its offices overseas because they’re needed for personal protection, but not for sale? One participant noted that their shipment, addressed to a U.S. military base in the Middle East, was halted because it didn’t fit the definition of the exemption under the rule, three people familiar with the call said.“This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masks,” said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “But it shows the danger of regulating trade in vital medical supplies unilaterally by anecdote rather than after careful review and consultations with key trading partners.”This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masksRufus Yerxa 
 
The CBP memo, dated April 9, adds that the focus of the ban is on “commercial quantities,” which it defines as shipments valued at US$2,500 and containing more than 10,000 units of gloves, masks and other covered materials.A CBP spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.While the internal guidance is seen as a way to help administer the export ban, the document has not been made public, leaving exporters in the dark on any modification that may have been made to the rule.The rule reserved the right for the FEMA Administrator to establish additional exemptions “that he determines are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defence and will announce any such exemptions by notice in the Federal Register.”Such a notice has yet to be published.Bloomberg.com"

That prompted the bank’s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn’t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a “bad recession” and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.“Given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,” Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. “The first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do – outside of our ordinary course of business – to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.”Some of the damage was offset by gains in the bank’s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income — revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors — by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion.

Some 213,000 were handled in the first nine days of the program, and total requests reached 500,000 by April 3.“People have had a chance now to catch their breath a little bit and take stock in their personal financial situation,” Neil Parmenter, president and chief executive officer of the association, said in an interview. He described the response in the first week as “unprecedented.”

Initial demand may have been fuelled by unwarranted homeowner fears that the relief program was a “first-come, first-serve” limited-time offer combined with the approaching start of the month, when payments would be due, Parmenter said. The cooling pace of deferral requests doesn’t mean demand has peaked.“I don’t know if we can say it’s behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming in,” he said. “The traffic continues to be elevated from where it’d normally be.”I don't know if we can say it's behind us because the requests are absolutely still coming inNeil Parmenter 
 
Canada’s six largest banks have deferred about 12 per cent of the mortgages in their combined portfolios so far, and small and midsize banks have also deferred a “significant” number of the mortgages on their books, the association said. Some banks have reported that more than 90% of those seeking a deferral are approved.Number GrowingThe cash flow freed up by Canadians from deferrals completed to date is about $778 million (US$561 million) a month, or $2.3 billion a quarter, according to estimates from the association using an average monthly mortgage payment of $1,326. That number will grow in the weeks ahead, as more deferral requests are processed, the association said.The federal government’s $25-billion Canada Emergency Business Account has also shown strong pickup, with the country’s five biggest banks approving more than 72,000 loans for small-business clients on Friday, the program’s first day. That’d be worth about $2.89 billion in loans, assuming clients took up the full $40,000 of interest-free government-backed loans offered to them.“We knew the demand was obviously going to be heavy,” Parmenter said of the small-business relief program.Bloomberg.com"

The dollar’s surge has been particularly painful for countries that ran up borrowing in greenbacks and which will now struggle to cover the loans, especially as their exports tumble.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will convene by conference call on Wednesday. They are planning to offer lower income countries a freeze on bilateral government loan repayments for six or nine months or possibly into 2021, the Financial Times reported, citing an official.That fits a plan championed by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass. The World Bank in March estimated that US$14 billion in service payments are due this year.The fear is that if the emerging markets lag behind, “it means more of a U-shaped or an L-shaped kind of recovery for the U.S. and global economies,” said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury official who’s now chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.While the U.S., Europe and Japan have opened up the monetary and budgetary spigots to fight Covid-19 and its economic after-effects, many emerging economies lack the scope to do so.Morgan Stanley economists predict that emerging markets, excluding China, will shrink 4.1 per cent in the current quarter, a deeper dive than the 3.1 per cent of the first quarter of 2009 when the world was last in crisis, though shallower than what’s expected in richer economies. They also estimated in an April 3 report that the peak rate of growth during the recovery for those economies will be 6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus 7.7 per cent in the same period of 2010.The problem is even more acute in the poorest nations, where many denizens can’t easily practice the social distancing and regular hand washing that has become de-rigueur in rich countries.Such an environment leaves the IMF reckoning that emerging market and developing countries will need trillions of dollars in external financing to fight the virus, only part of which they can cover on their own, leaving gaps of hundreds of billions of dollars. Half of the international lending organization’s 189 members are already looking to it for aid.Georgieva is trying to rally the world into a unified display of support at the Fund’s semi-annual meeting, which starts Tuesday as a virtual gathering after the typical spring gathering in Washington was re-imagined.“Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other,” Georgieva said in an April 9 speech. “The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery.”There are questions, though, about whether the Fund has enough to counter the crisis, especially if it proves protracted.While the IMF says it has a US$1 trillion war chest, Ted Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the maximum amount available for new lending is US$787 billion, after taking into account existing commitments and other factors. “The IMF will need more” from the U.S. and the rest of the G20, he said.And it’s not just the amount of resources that are at issue. It’s what kind they are.The crisis has exposed a gaping hole at the center of the global economy. There’s no ultimate lender of last resort who can provide the liquidity that’s demanded in a financial emergency.Funds PulledSome $62 billion was yanked out of emerging markets in the first quarter in a global dash for cash by investors, twice the size of outflows at the peak of the world financial crisis, according to the Institute of International Finance.While there are signs that pressure is easing — Indonesia, for example, sold $4.3 billion of dollar bonds last week to help finance virus relief measures — there are risks the outflows could resume as the hit to emerging market growth becomes more evident, IIF analysts said.The Federal Reserve has moved to partly fill the void, including opening up dollar liquidity swap lines with Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Sheets said it should do the same with India, Indonesia and Chile.The IMF also has to step up and be willing to set its aside its traditional playbook for dealing with countries in trouble, in which it demands economic reforms in return for financial assistance.“This is much more of an exogenous shock,” said former U.S. Treasury official Mark Sobel, now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank focused on economic policy and central banking. “There needs to be some recalibration by the IMF to provide far more liberal and fast liquidity to members.”The fund seems to be trying to do just that.It’s looking at the use of precautionary short-term loans to get cash to countries, as well as other funding options like the increased use of reserve assets called special drawing rights, steps that would require the approval of rich nations.One problem with the IMF stepping up, said ex-IMF official Taimur Baig: Many countries don’t like turning to the organization because they fear being tarred as a nation in trouble.Repayment Pause“Drawing on to IMF resources has an element of stigma and it is still seen as the last resort of a crisis-hit nation,” said Baig, who’s now chief economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.For some emerging economies with balance of payment challenges, the “more expedient” currency-stabilizing measure is to draw on swap lines or repurchase agreements, as Indonesia has done, said Baig, questioning why the IMF doesn’t also offer those facilities.In the 2008-09 crisis, the G-20 banded together to come up with an action plan.That’s been more difficult this time for a group riven by rivalries — the U.S. and China over trade, Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil, and the U.K. and the European Union over Brexit.IIF President Tim Adams said the G-20 must rise to the occasion, nonetheless.“There will be enormous attention and enormous expectations” focused on this week’s gatherings, he said. “Not meeting them could be detrimental for markets and for confidence.”Bloomberg.com"

Apple iPhone sales grow again, pushing profits above expectations
Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.This year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.Bloomberg.com"

And now I would like to ask you: ‘Do you agree with these terms?’”In Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. “I go with the consensus. I agree,” he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico’s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless.

“We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,” he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. “I’m more than happy.”For the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world’s major oil producers to rein in output.We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and aliveSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman 
 
But the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world’s biggest economies.“The OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,” said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.Negative ReactionThe deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market — 20 per cent of global production.Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19…..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020For the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world’s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don’t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7 per cent to US$30.63 a barrel.Deal MakerThe biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation’s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He’s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise.

“Trump views himself as a deal maker,” said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So “Trump went to the oil market’s red phone.”The president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbour’s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn’t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Price WarSunday’s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia’s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group’s existing curbs at their current level.

Angered by Russia’s refusal to cut and Novak’s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25 per cent from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it’s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30 per cent in seconds — the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.Month of ChaosWhat followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market’s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time 
 
Brent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above US$70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to US$21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world’s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs. Whiting Petroleum Corp., once North Dakota’s biggest producer, filed for bankruptcy on April 1.Saudi SurgeAs Whiting was going bust, thousands of miles in Saudi Arabia engineers at Aramco were busy pushing their oil wells to the limit.At at exactly 11.29 a.m. on March 31, the giant video wall at the company’s operational nerve centre flashed total production surpassing 12 million barrels a day for the first time in history. Employees celebrated by snapping pictures, arms raised in triumph, according to photographs seen by Bloomberg News.

The next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day — enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.‘Wiped Out’It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world’s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be “wiped out.”Saudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.”Of 
 
 done in his life, this has to be the biggest” source=”Daniel Yergin” /]“You are waging economic warfare on Texas,” Senator Ted Cruz told the Saudi ambassador in Washington in a private conference call.Recalling the conversation in a media interview afterward, Cruz said: “Their response is, ‘But Russia. But Russia.’ And I said, ‘But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You’re supposed to be our friend. And so don’t screw with us.”By then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.“We see a huge oversupply in the oil market,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump TweetTrump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn’t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2020Brent crude jumped more than 45 per cent in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21 per cent — the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia’s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America’s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal’s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world’s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren’t in its interest.“Trump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,” said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. “Of all the deals he’s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.”Bloomberg.com"

As OPEC's tentative deal falls short, Canadian producers fear 1.7 million barrels a day will be shut in
OPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day — just below the initial plan of 10 million. Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels — less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were “horrifying.”West Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn’t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico’s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20. The group, however, didn’t mention any curbs in its communique following a meeting on Friday, only saying it would take measures to ensure stability.Bloomberg.com"

Cannabis bankruptcies start to roll in as pandemic halts financing
Global stock meltdown is a disaster for cannabis industry already on the brink
The long-term investment thesis for the industry hasn’t changed as legalization spreads and demand grows, but first companies need to survive long enough to see it, said MJBiz Daily analyst Mike Regan.Many cannabis companies were running low on cash and struggling to raise more before the pandemic, which only made the situation more difficult as equity markets tumbled and volatility spiked. The total amount of capital raised by the industry fell 69 per cent in March from a month earlier as funding sources dried up, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.This has weighed on stock prices. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index fell more than 50 per cent between mid-February and its recent low on March 18, and had already lost two-thirds of its value in the 12 months before that.Based on an analysis of 1,400 consumer stocks during the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, Regan said pot stocks are likely to fall even further. In those two bear markets, valuations typically compressed 30 per cent to 50 per cent, falling to 2.4x sales or 7.5x EBITDA. While pot stocks have lost more than 50 per cent on average, many are still trading above those multiples. This is particularly true in Canada, where the average enterprise valuations are 5x sales and 11.3x EBITDA.Those that do survive will rebound sharply, but the trick will be picking the winners, he said.“Even if the long-term cannabis investment thesis is intact, it’s going to come down to executing on that idea to actually realize that return,” Regan said.Bloomberg.com"

Compared to other groups at the same point in their lives, people in their 20s and 30s have relatively low levels of home ownership, net worth and real income, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper.“They’re walking a tight rope and there are cliffs on either side,” said Kathryn Edwards, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. “It’s hard to imagine someone making it through both of these recessions in this age group really unscathed.”Economic downturns are inevitable, but they’re not usually so severe.

People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been “much larger” than previous downturns.

Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person’s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn’t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.“I worry about the younger guys more,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They’re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, “I worry even more about the people without college diplomas.”

While white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won’t be able to afford a hospital visit.“It makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,” he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won’t retire on schedule.“You’re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,” he said. Millennials “will have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.”Already millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.“It could be a problem if the unemployment stops,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Private-sector forecasters now expect a historic contraction in second quarter U.S. output, followed by a rebound in the second half of the year.In an evening teleconference following the March 15 announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that he expected the virus to run its course and the U.S. economy to resume a normal level of activity. But he said “in the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible.”Since then, the U.S. central bank has begun rolling out a number of emergency lending programs first deployed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Those include measures to fund short-term borrowings of companies in the commercial paper market and clean up the balance sheets of dealer banks and money-market mutual funds by accepting a wide range of securities as collateral in exchange for cash loans.The Fed has also since announced new lending programs which would see them extend support to large companies through purchases of longer-term corporate debt, as well as facilities that will offer lifelines to small and medium-sized businesses. Investors also increasingly expect the central bank to intervene in the market for municipal debt as states and cities face an increasingly dire financial situation brought about by government-mandated shutdowns, which have decimated tax revenues.Bloomberg.com"

Core debt in the region reversed gains. France’s first-quarter output shrank the most since World War II, the latest indicator of the severity of the shock to the world’s biggest trading region. Spain confirmed having Europe’s most-extensive outbreak of the disease, with deaths and infections rising the most in four days.While the S&P 500 briefly reached a more-than 20 per cent gain from its March low this week, investors remain reluctant to take big risks while forecasts are for the virus to grow rapidly in some of the biggest economies — the U.S., Japan, Germany, France and the U.K. They’re also concerned that fiscal stimulus measures will be too late or not enough to counter the effects of the pandemic as efforts to formulate a European response drag on.“As the quarter progresses, investors start to understand that everything we’re seeing is in the form of assistance and aid to just tide the economy over,” Bob Michele, global chief investment officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, said on Bloomberg TV. “It’s not stimulus that gets the economy going at a much higher rate than where it is.”Elsewhere, the Australian dollar slipped after S&P Global Ratings cut the country’s credit-rating outlook to negative from stable.

That compares with the 140-basis point spread it offered on $750 million of 10-year debt last year.The price Suncor is paying to borrow is by far outpacing the increase in risk premiums broadly in the Canadian company bond market in the past month amid global credit volatility. As of Monday, investors were demanding 245 basis points over government securities to hold Canadian corporate debt, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. That compares with 118 basis points buyers required when Suncor last tapped the market in May. The company’s new notes were priced to yield 5.039 per cent, compared with 3.128 per cent in the previous deal.

Still CovetedSuncor sold debt at a time when Alberta is asking the Canadian government for an aid package that will help energy companies deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and an oil-price crisis.Despite spiking funding costs, Suncor is still rated investment-grade at Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, making it one of the highest rated firms in an industry that has largely moved to the riskier high-yield category. This may explain why 75 investors took part in today’s transaction, placing enough orders to cover the deal size by more than three times, according to people familiar with the matter.In response to the plunge in crude prices, the company slashed its planned capital spending for the year by about 26 per cent to a range of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion to conserve cash. It’s also cutting operating expenditures and adjusting refinery utilization. “Suncor’s liquidity is good,” Moody’s said in a statement today, adding that the company would take needed action to maintain its capital structure and cash flow should oil prices remain low.A representative for Calgary-based Suncor didn’t provide immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg.Bloomberg.com"

Workers get an extra 10 personal days to help with daycare issues and the ability to change schedules and do split shifts.When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, Toronto-Dominion expects to keep work-from-home as an option for call centre staff.“There’s no telling what this is going to look like when we’re all done and how people are going to feel, but I would like to continue to allow agents to work from home even after the crisis,” Smith said. “And that would be solely for flexibility.”Bloomberg.com"

He also said measures to deal with the crises may cause Alberta’s budget deficit this year to almost triple to $20 billion.“I cannot overstate how grave the implications of this will be for jobs, the economy, and the financial security of Albertans,” Kenney said.

Kenney also said that the province won’t be able to start relaxing social-distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus until the end of May. Once the province does start to relax those measures, it will mimic other jurisdictions like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea that have managed to both contain the virus while keeping their economies functioning, he said.That will include aggressive mass testing to identify positive cases and those with immunity, precise targeting of close contacts, border screening, strict enforcement of quarantine orders and encouraging the use of masks in crowded public spaces, he said.Kenney also released projections for the numbers of potential infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus in the province under different scenarios:Under the “probable” scenario, Alberta may see as many as 800,000 infections and 400 to 3,100 deathsUnder the less likely “elevated” scenario, the province may see as many as 1 million infections and 500 to 6,600 deaths. If the province implemented no social-distancing measures, it could have experienced as many as 1.6 million infections and 32,000 deaths.“These models are not a done deal,” Kenney said. “I want Albertans to see them as a challenge.

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.

Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”The U.S. Policy Response“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”Potential Treatments“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”Getting Back to Normal“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”Japan’s Response“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.”Business Recovery“Economically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.”“Countries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.”Bloomberg.com"

Then one of the bank’s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: “The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr’s note.”The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's note 
 
More than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan’s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they’re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home.

“We’ve stated many times that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to,” said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. “We have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor’s note.”Those tensions aren’t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It’s the finance industry’s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where “essential” workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Trading DelugeSome investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it’s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank’s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn’t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it’s trying to be respectful of people’s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.

Traders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn’t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked “important” last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. “We remain open,” the memo said. “Driving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.” Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown — even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Skeleton CrewsMost big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm’s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor’s note to work from home.

Inside Natixis SA’s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: “Highly Confidential: COVID-19 — Staff Infection List.”Workers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.“Natixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,” said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. “We have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees’ health and help slow the propagation of the virus.”‘Push Everyone’Market swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it’s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York’s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan’s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank’s global head of markets, “continues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,” Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna’s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn’t have been possible if they’d been working from home.“With the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,” Adragna wrote. “Let’s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET’S GO.”

JPMorgan’s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders’ dealings. It isn’t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven’t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems “reasonably designed” to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she’s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she’ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier that deaths were showing signs of hitting a plateau in the state that has become the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak.

The mostly upbeat tone in markets followed another negative week, and the mood among investors remains divided.

As of last week’s close, the stake was worth $369.4 million.The Saudis are getting a bargain-bin price for Carnival — it’s down 81 per cent this year — as the cruise industry faces unprecedented risks. The Public Investment Fund has invested abroad previously, including stakes in Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. But it isn’t generally known for making distressed investments.Now, it owns a slice of the dominant cruise operator, with a fleet of more than 100 ships and no customers to sail on them — at least for now.Carnival’s operations came to an almost complete stop last month after a series of coronavirus outbreaks at sea. Carnival’s Diamond Princess had more than 700 coronavirus cases, the biggest outbreak outside of mainland China for a time.Rival operators Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. have also shut down.The cruise industry was left out of the US$2.2 trillion U.S. stimulus bill, which excluded non-U.S. businesses. Although it is headquartered in Miami, Carnival is technically incorporated in Panama — an arrangement that allows it to avoid U.S. income taxes and minimum-wage requirements.Competitors are also domiciled outside the U.S.Raising FundsSince the halt of operations, Carnival has raised US$6.25 billion to help meet expenses, but it’s paying a steep price. Some US$4 billion in bonds were priced with an 11.5 per cent coupon last week. The shares were acquired before a planned stock offering by Carnival, so the percentage holding will change.In an interview Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said Carnival may turn to major shipbuilding nations such as Italy or Germany for lower-cost loans.“Yes, those are definitely potential sources,” he said. “And there are others.”Bloomberg.com"

Pot companies completed two capital raises worth just US$5.6 million the week ended March 27, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors. That’s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn’t able to recover from.

“The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,” the company said in a statement, “making it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.”There are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company’s weak revenue in the quarter — just US$7.3 million — prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges. Revised debt covenants require it to raise $40 million in equity by April 30, a “startling sum” that “could mean severe downward pressure” on the stock, according to CIBC analyst John Zamparo. If it can’t secure that financing, that “would put its going concern status at risk,” said BMO’s Tamy Chen.Although cannabis sales jumped as self-isolation orders took effect last month, providing a rare respite for the struggling industry, there are already signs the initial spike is starting to wane.After a notable increase in mid-March, “sales velocity meaningfully decelerated” on the Ontario Cannabis Store website last weekend, “suggesting that this recent surge may be transitory unless COVID-19 quarantine measures are meaningfully extended,” Chen said in a note. “We believe the COVID-19 fallout presents incremental downside for industry sales over the balance of this year.”Bloomberg.com"

At the other end of the spectrum, 4CAST projects a net loss of 100,000, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. puts it at 175,000.Such disparity may reflect just how quickly the virus has overwhelmed Canada’s economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out massive fiscal support to encourage employers to keep workers on payrolls, but it’s unclear how effective those programs will be.Prior to the pandemic, the biggest decline in Canadian employment was 125,000 in January 2009.Last month’s potentially epic loss was foreshadowed by jobless claims that have already reached records, with more than 2 million Canadians applying for employment insurance in the second half of March.Statistics Canada conducted its labor force survey between March 15 and March 21, meaning the results should capture the early days of the disruption.The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey of 19 economists is for a drop of 500,000 jobs.

Canada’s energy sector has been collateral damage in the Saudi-Russia oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Storage tanks worldwide are brimming with crude as the global pandemic destroys demand, while Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a fight for market share.At one point last week, a benchmark of Canadian heavy crude tumbled as low as US$3.82 a barrel. The price of Western Canadian Select for May was US$16.25 below West Texas Intermediate Thursday, according to NE2 Group.And while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opened the government’s coffers to businesses in an effort to save the Canadian economy, nothing specific has been done for the energy sector yet. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week that further relief measures, specifically for the oil and gas and airline sectors, will come in the “not too distant future.”The twin shock has taken its toll on all energy producers, big and small.Canadian oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. said last week it will shut in one of its two production lines at its two-year-old, 194,000 barrel-a-day Fort Hills oil sands mine. Additionally, demand losses could see commercial inventory levels to be breached within two to three weeks if Canadian production isn’t further reduced, Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this week.RBC’s Pardy said Canadian oil producers will need to shut in or curtail about 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, or one-quarter to one-third of supply, in the second and third quarters of this year.“We have fielded a number of queries regarding the potential role that policymakers in Canada could play in providing energy sector support,” he said. “We believe that Shut & Swap — a conceptual arrangement aimed at revenue smoothing — could be a partial remedy.”Bloomberg.com"

But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don’t apply.From the shale patch of Texas and the oilsands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won’t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, “there could soon be no place for their oil to go.”Every imaginable space — from tanks and pipelines to rail cars — is filling to the brim. It’s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that’s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing.

“It’s important to think about who’s going to shut in. It’s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview. “It’s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.”Staggering DestructionThe rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it’ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts — in itself a mammoth undertaking —the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America’s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation’s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is “homeless,” with “literally nowhere to go,” consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.Production is starting to buckle everywhere.IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oilsands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.Brazil’s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador, Citigroup Inc. said, “isn’t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.”Producers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most “immune,” Goldman’s Currie said. Those “sitting behind thousands of miles of pipe” are the most exposed.Russia VulnerableRussia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.Neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face “severe offtake issues,” said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.While logistics are critical, oil’s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At US$25 a barrel crude, about 5 per cent of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.Companies are also slashing spending. BP Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about US$5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren’t economical at current oil prices.“In the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,” said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc.Emerging WinnerAmid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than US$10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world — from Egypt to Japan.Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil’s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country’s free-market ethics.But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.“The market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “That horse has left the barn.”Bloomberg.com"

Oil rallied on expected output curbs.The S&P 500 fell for the third time in four days as investors digested the abysmal jobs report that captured data in the period largely before government-mandated shutdowns went into widespread effect.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what’s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.“This is freezing the market,” John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. “The best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don’t think anyone’s really expecting anything before that.”

Real estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada’s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it’s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it’s all but shut down in Quebec.‘No Buyers Are Out’It’s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven’t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.“We’re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it’s ridiculous,” he says. “Why would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.”Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a “tough but temporary blow” to Canada’s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt 
 
How quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.“The longer this goes, the more it’s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,” said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. “So it’ll affect qualifications.”The uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.“People aren’t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,” Collu said in a phone interview. “Purchase activity is going to be curtailed.”Rebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.“We see the outlook improving markedly next year,” RBC’s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. “Exceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.”Papailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and “you can go outside without getting your children or parents sick — I think the market is going to go bananas.”Elton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there’s a broader recession — and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.“There’s the big unknown — the elephant south of the border,” said Ash.Bloomberg.com"

He also tweeted that the cut could be up to 15 million barrels.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!— Donald J.

Canadian WCS surged $3.80 to $9.09. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t spoken to the Saudi crown price and hasn’t agreed to cut oil production to boost prices, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a text message.The Middle East kingdom also didn’t confirm the cuts, but called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC+ producer alliance to reach a “fair deal” that would restore balance in oil markets, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Any curbs by the group would be conditional on other countries joining, according to a delegate.

“The 10, 15 million barrel a day cut is just not going to happen. On top of that, Russia has older oil wells, so they can’t restart in the same way that Saudi Arabia can,” said Tariq Zahir, a fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.He added that there is a chance that the countries might agree to some sort of curb, but if there was a supply reduction of that size, it would come from inventories filling up storage, leading to economic shuts in. The move comes after oil was already climbing following China’s instruction to government agencies to start buying cheap crude for its strategic reserves.Despite the U.S. president’s optimism, Saudi Arabia hasn’t appeared to relent on its bid to flood the market yet, saying on Wednesday it was pumping at a record and had this week loaded almost 19 million barrels of oil in a single day. Meanwhile, Russia has said it’s not satisfied with the oil price.If collective action does remove 10 million barrels a day from the market, that would be the equivalent of about 10 per cent of world demand prior to the impact of coronavirus crisis.That may not be enough to stop the pain that’s rippled across the energy industry as demand craters with the coronavirus outbreak shutting down economies around the world, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura. The trading house raised its consumption-loss estimate to around 35 million barrels a day.“We have no hope of production cuts matching the demand destruction,” he told Bloomberg, adding that by the middle to late April, “oil will have come out of the ground and will struggle to find a home.”That view is consistent with a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note earlier this week, citing that any conceivable oil production cut by the U.S., OPEC+ and Canada would still “fall well short” of its estimated 26 million barrels a day of demand loss and only provide “fleeting support to inland crude prices.”Meanwhile, the physical crude market continues to show deepening signs of strain.Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s physical supply, was assessed at $15.135 on Wednesday, the lowest since at least 1999. Crude has slipped below $10 in some areas including Canada and shale regions in the U.S., Belarus wants to buy Russian oil for $4, while some grades have posted negative prices.As supply balloons, there are growing signs that the world is running out of places to store the glut.Bloomberg.com"

Once the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, Whiting lost money in four of the last five years and spiralled deeper into debt just as the COVID-19 outbreak crushed energy demand. The company’s Bakken primacy won it little praise because the region was already falling out of favour as drillers shifted to lower-cost prospects in the Permian Basin.Touted as one of the “comeback kids” of U.S. shale by Canaccord Genuity in late 2015, Whiting said Wednesday that it’s agreed to hand most of its ownership to noteholders in exchange for erasing more than US$2.2 billion in debt, according to a statement.US$262 Million MaturityAs many as 40 per cent of U.S. oil and gas companies could crater into bankruptcy or distress over the next two years as they grapple with a market crash and the coronavirus outbreak, according to asset manager Pickering Energy Partners LP.Shale drillers aren’t the sole sub sector clobbered by the crash. Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc., which specializes in hauling gear to offshore drilling sites and production platforms, disclosed Wednesday that it’s negotiating a plan with creditors to ease a US$1.2 billion debt burden. The company is planning a Chapter 11 filing.On Wednesday, Denver-based Whiting faced the maturity of US$262 million in convertible-notes . Whiting filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the Southern District of Texas, listing debt of US$3.6 billion and assets worth US$7.6 billion in its bankruptcy petition.Even before the viral pandemic sent crude prices tumbling to the lowest in almost two decades, Whiting was struggling and never fully recovered from the last market crash of 2014-2016. In December 2015, as crude prices were just weeks from dipping to a 13-year low, Canaccord analyst Stephen Berman listed Whiting among a group of potential “comeback kids” in the U.S. shale industry.US$20 OilWhen former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executive Brad Holly took the reins as Whiting’s chief in late 2017, oil prices were rising and at one point breached US$75 a barrel. But the debt load remained stubbornly high, prompting Holly last year to fire one-third of his workforce and scale back production targets after posting an unexpected quarterly loss.Oil now trades around US$20 a barrel, well below the US$50 level that Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum estimates Whiting requires to stay afloat. The company, which had a market capitalization of US$11 billion in 2014, was valued at about US$62 million as of Tuesday. Whiting’s bankruptcy filing followed that of shale drillers Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Sanchez Energy Corp., which sought protection last year.Moelis & Co. is Whiting’s financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser and Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser.The case is Whiting Petroleum Corporation, 20-32021, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District.Bloomberg.com"

Investors are grappling with the reality that the world’s biggest economy will stay crippled for longer after Trump heeded advice from the government’s top doctors that re-opening the U.S. in two weeks risks greater loss of life. The president said that social distancing guidelines would remain until at least April 30. But traders also continue to try to plumb the bottom and look for bright spots, such as in health-care companies that could produce products that help curb the outbreak.

"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Doug Alexander,Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts,Canada’s mortgage rates are creeping up — even though the country’s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.,https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada,,"March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT","Canada’s mortgage rates are creeping up — even though the country’s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That’s due to the “enormous pressure” Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.“The costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,” Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. “Every single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.”The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada’s large domestic lenders were also offering “prime minus” deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Funding CostsTypical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.“The big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,” he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they’re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.“The banks just can’t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,” Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.“I believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,” Cooper said. “I don’t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the automaker might be able to help make much-needed ventilators, the scarce breathing machines used to keep coronavirus patients alive.The deal would help the company, which has had tense relations with Trump. It would help the administration, which faced charges that the pandemic caught it napping. Most importantly, it would help the sickest patients, those facing death without machines to breathe for them.But not 10 days later, Trump accused GM of foot-dragging and price-gouging in its effort to replenish the supply of medical equipment. “Always a mess with Mary B,” Trump tweeted, hours before invoking the Defense Production Act, which allowed him to order GM to move.As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2020Newly revealed details show that GM has been continuously engaged in the effort — order or no order — and company officials say the sprint from first phone call to production will take about a month. A parallel effort by Ford Motor Co. isn’t expected to bear fruit until June, though the company has said it’s speeding up its work. Trump did an about-face Sunday, saying GM is doing a “fantastic job.”Even as Trump was excoriating GM on Friday, the automaker and its Seattle-area partner, Ventec Life Systems Inc., were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN: ventilator, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulizer. When they start in mid-April, it will culminate a lightning-fast effort to convert an auto-parts plant into a medical-equipment complex.

“The speed has been challenging,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s global vice president of manufacturing, said in a Sunday evening interview. “But we know it will save thousands of lives. Making cars is cool, but it doesn’t compare to what we’re doing.”Trump’s criticism of GM boiled down to the company asking the federal government to “show me the the money” before it would put the venture into high gear, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. In initial discussions with the administration, GM and its partner were seeking about US$250 million for Ventec and its components suppliers to get production moving. The government wanted to contribute a fraction of that, people familiar with the deliberations said.“You can’t get to the finish line unless you first go to the starting gate,” Navarro, who was appointed last week to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, said in an email to Bloomberg News.Stop the SpreadThe sprint started with exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called Stop the Spread. It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to COVID-19. The group is led by retired American Express Co. Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson, founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc.Making cars is cool, but it doesn't compare to what we're doingGerald Johnson 
 
They asked Barra’s team what they needed to make ventilators. GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force.For his part, Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise, factories and a workforce to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals.Exponential GrowthManagers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help Ventec go from building a maximum of 250 ventilators a month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year. The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year. It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic’s early weeks.“They produce millions of cars a year in the U.S.,” Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks said of GM. “We produce hundreds of ventilators a month. They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale.”The next day, Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in. Kudlow, one of the administration’s primary pitchmen, floated the idea on television. He cited GM as an example of a company that was stepping up “on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.”

But GM was still studying how to make it happen. On March 19, Phil Kinley, vice president of manufacturing and labour and the plant-floor leader of the project, flew with engineers to Ventec’s site in Washington, Johnson said. Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator’s 700 parts to GM’s Tech Center in Warren, north of Detroit.GM’s purchasing team went to work, Johnson said. They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows to wipers. They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses. By March 22, GM had most parts lined up.“The supply base really stepped up,” Johnson said.Painstaking AssemblyThe VOCSN, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017, is primarily used for critical-care ventilation. It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient, and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs, secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep the patient’s chest clear.The company boasts on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment. To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven, a GM assembly plant was ill suited. The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of a Buick. Making a ventilator is more like building a watch: Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs.That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines.

The facility has 300 on staff and will need 1,000 to achieve the production levels GM and Ventec want to reach. The carmaker has started evaluating new hires and is seeking volunteers among the staff idled by the shutdown of parts production in Kokomo and metal stamping in nearby Marion, Indiana.GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process, Johnson said.“This is truly a major step at a critical moment,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime watcher of Detroit’s automakers. “GM was written off and appears to be coming through.”Money MattersGM and Ventec now need to decide how the units will be distributed and paid for. Negotiations continue with the government, which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to people familiar with the matter.That assumes a deal gets done. To the surprise of GM and Ventec, Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing. He tweeted that GM officials “want top dollar.”GM said it’s building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec, which is the major player in negotiations with the government. The machines normally cost about US$18,000 apiece, while some ventilators can run as high as US$50,000.Another benefit of Ventec’s VOCSN is it replaces four other pieces of hardware typically needed for acute respiratory care. Using it could lower costs for hospitals because they won’t need to buy oxygenators, nebulizers and devices to clear the lungs.When Trump complained last week about pricing, people in the GM-Ventec venture thought that the device’s five-in-one therapy capabilities may not have been completely understood. People familiar with negotiations said there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline, and they were caught off guard when the president complained.As negotiations go on, GM and Ventec say they are progressing fast. “The responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need,” Brooks said.There’s already been a change in sentiment from Trump. At his press briefing on Sunday, he said, “I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now.”Bloomberg.com"

Regina: Layoffs and Brides in TearsFour months ago, Ryan Urzada reopened the Atlas Hotel in Saskatchewan’s capital city after a $10-million (US$7.1 million) renovation that included a new indoor water park.

With bill deferments, he figures he’ll be able to hang on for two or three months. But he worries longer term.“The cash flow requirement this fall when all these bills come due for the whole economy is going to be overwhelming,” he said, suggesting that deferrals are going to have be turned into forgiveness. “You can defer all you want but everyone’s going to have their hands out in September.”Montreal: Restaurant Workers in NeedMandatory closures hit restaurants in Montreal, Quebec, a city known for its bustling food scene.

Applicants to the fund include Robin Wattie, a 36-year-old musician who saw her European tour canceled and lost her bar tending and waitressing jobs. She’s awaiting a response to her application for unemployment benefits but worries she should have filed for provincial assistance instead.For now she makes do with a tiny cash stash and her credit card, and plans to ask for a new income replacement announced last week by Trudeau that gives $2,000 a month.“It’s like this big stressful puzzle,” she said.Calgary: A Blow for Sioux NationPaul Poscente has been getting calls every hour from his oil and gas clients, cancelling projects.His company, Backwoods Energy Services, provides a variety of services, including clearing timber and brush from work sites and building access roads and bridges. He’s now expecting a 30 per cent to 50 per cent decline in business as Alberta takes the hit from the Russian-Saudi oil price war. Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta. It employs about 300 workers from the community, and its $140 million in annual revenue provides its largest independent source of funds.“It feels like I’m doing a disservice to my family,” Poscente said. “It’s materially devastating to the community, and it feels personal.”Still, Poscente, 57, said the company has grown with an “ultra-conservative” balance sheet since he took over as CEO in 2015 and expects it to withstand the economic troubles better than most competitors.Toronto: Air Attendant GroundedFlight attendant Max Audet got notice a week ago he’d be laid off from Air Canada Rouge on April 3.“The main thing on my mind is that I don’t know how long it’s going to be for,” said Audet, 28, who is also a rep for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents flight attendants. “It really adds to the stress.”

Audet has immediately cut back. He’s reduced automatic savings to his retirement account for his final paycheques and is being careful what he buys at the grocery store. He takes comfort from the fact that with five years under his belt, he’s still senior to 62 per cent of Air Canada staff, thanks to a big hiring spree at the airline in recent years.“I’m definitely worried about the lasting impact it will have on airlines,” he said. “Will we see people doing less travel, which could definitely affect staffing levels over time?”Toronto: Scared for the HomelessOutside the Church of the Redeemer on Toronto’s Mink Mile, one of Canada’s ritziest shopping districts, the drop-in lunch program had plenty of customers.On a normal day, The Common Table provides about 80 lunches to the city’s must vulnerable residents, but with similar programs closing, the number has spiked.

The White House had no immediate comment and didn’t release a summary of the call.The U.S. president has earlier said he does not want to see the energy sector “wiped out” after Russia and Saudi Arabia “both went crazy” and launched into a conflict that depressed oil prices.

“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.”Crude oil futures tumbled as much as 7.7 per cent in New York, touching an 18-year low.The Trump-Putin call came at the request of the U.S. and was “prolonged,” according to the Kremlin, which didn’t specify how long it lasted.Trump’s view on the the dispute marks a shift from earlier this month, when he likened the plunge in oil prices to a “tax cut” for Americans. The U.S. president spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 9 about the dispute.Trump has long argued that improving relations between Washington and Moscow could help solve international disputes. The president said he wanted to discuss trade with Putin, though he said he expected the Russian president to raise objections to U.S. sanctions. State-run Tass quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin didn’t ask Trump for sanctions relief on the call.Oil tumbled earlier to its lowest point in nearly two decades, heading for the worst quarter on record as coronavirus lockdowns cascaded through the world’s largest economies, leaving the market overwhelmed by cratering demand and a ballooning surplus.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates consumption will drop by 26 million barrels a day this week. Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months, despite U.S. warnings against flooding the market.Some analysts argue Russia’s motivations extend well beyond oil and are complicated by the federation’s anger over U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia to Germany. And the price for getting Russia to back down could be too high.“Russia’s concerns with the U.S. go beyond market share. Putin is frustrated with sanctions and may be more interested in punishing the U.S. than Saudi Arabia,” said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and chief executive of drilling services company Canary LLC. “If Trump wants an agreement with Putin, he may have to promise to ease up on sanctions. I am not sure he can deliver without the backing of congress.”Rosneft PJSC over the weekend sold its assets in Venezuela to the Russian government, a move that shields the Russian oil giant from further U.S. sanctions while keeping Moscow behind the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Fears of broader sanctions have grown after the U.S. in recent months slapped restrictions on Rosneft trading companies for handling business with Venezuela.Talks between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies broke down in early March as Russia refused to sign on to larger production cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia. The failure to reach an agreement prompted the Saudis to unleash a price war which, combined with the devastating effect of the virus pandemic, caused the market to crash.Global demand is slumping by as much as 20 million barrels a day, about 20 per cent, as billions of people go into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The outlook remains dire, with traders, banks and analysts forecasting a huge oversupply as governments effectively shut their economies.Oil industry leaders, trade groups and some Republican senators have pressed the Trump administration to seek a diplomatic solution with Saudi Arabia. Six senators from oil-producing states last week urged Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia, while highlighting several “powerful tools at our disposal,” including sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.“Trump would have better success pressing Saudi Arabia than Russia since they are dependent on the U.S. for protection, intelligence and arms sales,” Eberhart said.On the coronavirus, the two sides expressed concern about the scale of its spread, according to the Kremlin.

While this is the first plant in the region to shut, refineries across the U.S. and Canada are cutting back as the gasoline and jet fuel markets seize up. Measures to slow the spread of coronavirus may result in an unprecedented plunge in fuel demand, with estimates that global consumption is shrinking by 20 per cent or more.U.S. government data show that the amount of refined products supplied to the market fell by more than 2 million barrels a day in the week ended March 20. With coronavirus cases in the U.S. on the rise since then, and more parts of the country shutting down businesses and limiting travel, consumption has likely slid further.Valero Energy Corp. has reduced processing rates across about half of its refineries, and Phillips 66 said many of its refineries are near minimum rates. Suncor Energy Inc. said it’s adjusting its refinery utilization. With refineries using less crude, the oil market is starting to seize up, with at least one pipeline asking producers to reduce output.Refineries globally have been cutting back activity. Last week, Gruppo API SpA indefinitely stopped its Falconara facility in Italy until fuel demand recovers. The nation’s fuel consumption has declined by about 85 per cent, a spokesman for the company said, citing a union of retail gas stations. Meanwhile, huge refineries across Asia are cutting back as billions of people stay home.Bloomberg.com"

Refineries are starting to shut down because nobody needs the fuels they produce. In physical oil markets, barrels are already changing hands for less than US$10, and in a few landlocked markets producers are paying consumers to take away their crude.“The physical oil market has seized up,” said Gary Ross, an influential oil watcher and chief investment officer of Black Gold Investors LLC. “The logistics are struggling to cope because we are facing a catastrophic loss of demand.”

‘Very, very frightening’: Calls for government bailout grow louder as oilpatch faces bleak outlook
Oil traders say it’s likely to get worse this week.The root cause is an accelerating plunge in consumption that’s without precedent since a steady flow of oil became essential to the global economy more than a century ago. The great crash of 1929, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the global financial crisis don’t come close. The world normally uses 100 million barrels of oil day, and traders and analysts reckon as much as a quarter of that has disappeared in just a few weeks.The global airline industry is grounded, countless businesses and factories are shuttered and billions of people have been forced to stay home.“Demand clearly is off, in some parts of the world, very dramatically,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV.The immediate problem is a lack of storage in the right places. With demand running 20 million barrels a day below supply, the world won’t have enough tanks to store the surplus in two or three months. But the issue is even more pressing because global tank capacity, mostly concentrated in a few hubs like Rotterdam, the Caribbean and Singapore, isn’t available to every producer. For those without access to pipelines and ports, local storage will run out in days, traders and consultants say.

For those with access to the coast, one solution is to use the supertanker fleet as floating storage tanks, and that’s happening at an unprecedented rate. The CEO of the world’s largest tanker owner, Frontline Ltd., said on Friday that he’d never known such demand to hire ships for long-term storage. Traders could put 100 million barrels at sea, he estimated, but even that accounts for just a few days’ oversupply.In the U.S., one of the largest pipeline companies, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has asked oil producers to voluntarily cut output to avoid overwhelming the network that connects well heads to refineries through thousands of miles of pipelines.The world is running out of places to put oil because the shutdown of vast swathes of the economy has been catastrophic for demand. The collapse in commercial air travel has cut jet fuel use by up to 75 per cent, or almost 5 million barrels a day.As for gasoline, American drivers are the single biggest source of demand, using more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. As whole states, including California and New York, have told people to stay home, billions of car journeys have been lost. It’s a pattern repeated in Europe and Asia.“Demand destruction is unprecedented,” said Ben Luckock, co-head of trading at Trafigura Group, the second-largest independent oil trader. He estimates the hit to consumption will total 22 million barrels a day in April.We are facing a catastrophic loss of demandGary Ross 
 
Around the world, about 700 refineries turn crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. They are starting to dial down production and even shut outright because demand for the fuel they produce is so dire. In India, for example, where 1.3 billion people are under lockdown until mid-Aptil, the nation’s biggest refinery has cut processing rates at most plants by as much as 30 per cent.A small refiner in Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s virus outbreak, shut on Friday because demand for fuel plunged 85 per cent.As the refining system withers, the crude oil market is suffering. Many crudes, especially sticky, sulfurous grades that refiners find hard to process, trade at hefty discounts to international benchmarks. Western Canadian Select, a tarry blend squeezed from Alberta’s oilsands, reached a record low of US$4.51 a barrel on Friday.

In the U.S., Oklahoma Sour is changing hands at US$5.75, Nebraska Intermediate at US$8, while Wyoming Sweet prices at US$3 a barrel.In one obscure corner of the American crude market, prices have already turned negative. Wyoming Asphalt Sour, a dense oil used mostly to produce paving bitumen, was bid at minus 19 cents a barrel in mid-March by Trading Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.The surprise, perhaps, is that benchmark futures are still trading as high as they are. Brent, the North Sea grade that sets the price for about two-thirds of the world’s oil, ended last week at US$24.93 a barrel, well above the historic low of US$9.55 a barrel in 1998.Luckock at Trafigura says future prices are likely to fall another US$10. Black Gold’s Ross also says Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will be trading in the teens within days.The next stage of the oil market’s meltdown will be widespread production shutdowns as drillers decide the only option is to leave it in the ground until better days return. There are signs this is starting to happen.Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras has announced it will reduce output by 100,000 barrels a day this year because of the lack of demand. In Canada, some producers have shut down output, and Glencore Plc., the world’s largest commodity trading house, has shut down its production in Chad.Many producers are reluctant to shut wells because even though they’re losing money at today’s prices, some cashflow is often better than none at all. But as more refineries idle, the pipeline system grinds to a halt and storage tanks fill to the brim, they will soon have no choice.“The problem is no one wants to be the first to shut-in,” Black Gold’s Ross said.Bloomberg.com"

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection.

A handful of experts is saying that will happen again.The comeback trail would be steep and long. The spread of coronavirus is crushing demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia are creating a glut. Everybody agrees U.S. production will take a bigger hit than last time, when it dipped before soaring. As many as 70% of the 6,000 shale drillers may go bankrupt, and one-third of shale-patch workers are expected to lose their jobs. Wall Street, which financed the last boom, has cut off the cash spigot.But some experts are saying the future, however far off, will be better. They’re looking past the dire forecasts and vertical chart lines and cautioning against despair. They’re echoing a widespread view that’s mostly unspoken during the market meltdown: Yes, America can shock the world again. The boom-and-bust cycle will shift, and shale is in a position, with its infrastructure, its ability to ramp-up quickly and its plentiful reserves, to rise from the ashes stronger than ever.When the dust settles in the Permian Basin and other American shale fields, the survivors will be leaner and more tech savvy, according to Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit Ltd. That means lower production costs and a greater ability to respond to the next price rebound with the last thing Moscow and Riyadh want — another boom.“Companies go bankrupt, but rocks don’t go bankrupt,” Yergin said in an interview. “When this all shakes out, there will be other people to develop shale.”Noah Barrett also believes the growth engine of U.S. crude production will be humbled, but won’t flicker out. That’s because shale has extensive infrastructure that isn’t going anywhere.“The resource is still there, the pipeline capacity, the processing capacity,” said Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. “Those are still there.”Even if predictions are correct, that overall American oil output will slide to 8 million or 9 million barrels a day, down about one-third from the current 13 million, the U.S. would still count among the world’s very top producers, Barrett said.Bloomberg Intelligence is forecasting a more-modest production falloff of about 1.5 million barrels a day.The weakest companies “will go into stronger hands,” said Vincent G. Piazza, BI’s senior oil analyst. “The industry is going to be in a lot better shape than in 2014-2016. The balance sheet is in a lot better shape. I wouldn’t underestimate the ability of this industry to re-create itself.”Fereidun Fesharaki is a shale believer, too. The chairman of global energy consultant FGE said he also expects the price squeeze to force explorers to become more efficient and cost-competitive.Still, any rays of optimism must penetrate a very dense, dark cloud. In the market cataclysm that’s still unfolding, crude and fuel prices around the world have sunk to levels not seen in nearly two decades.As if by evil magic, the Covid-19 outbreak has chased tens of millions of people from streets, stores, factories and travel hubs, suddenly degrading demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel across the world’s largest economies.Veteran crude analyst Roger Diwan expects global consumption to plunge by more than 14 million barrels a day — the biggest demand shock since the birth of the oil age. The pipeline that hauls 60% of the East Coast’s gasoline supply from the Gulf Coast is cutting capacity by one-fifth. In Chicago, wholesale gasoline tumbled to 15 cents a gallon, the lowest since at least 1992.The virus-driven calamity has been compounded by the disintegration earlier this month of the Russia-Saudi cooperation pact that capped global crude supplies. Because of the rapidly expanding worldwide glut of crude, a barrel of oil in some parts of Texas recently fetched about $16. In Canada, oil traded for less than $10.The price plunge instantly made thousands of prospective shale sites money-losing propositions. Companies have been in such a hurry to cut losses that some have paid early-termination penalties on rigs and other gear to halt work before contracts are up.Slashing SpendingEven Chevron Corp. is retrenching. The California giant, widely recognized as holding some of the richest acreage in the Permian, said Tuesday it was slashing spending by $4 billion and halting share buybacks to conserve cash.In the final three months of 2019, nine explorers and six service companies filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone LLC. That represented $13.5 billion in debt. This year’s churn is just getting started. Mizuho Securities analyst Paul Sankey expects as many as 70% of the 6,000 or so shale drillers to go bankrupt before the cycle turns.But private-equity firms that swooped in to buy ailing explorers and tempting assets during the last bust won’t be able to unfurl a safety net this time. The buy-and-flip model that underpinned their foray into shale has disappeared, forcing those firms to become oilfield operators, which in turn means tapping their own credit facilities, said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy Group, the biggest owner of non-operated U.S. shale assets.Only about one-third of the Permian and other U.S. fields count as sweet spots that can harvest oil profitably at $30 a barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate traded at $21.42 on Friday.“Private equity’s going to be out of the game,” Rainbolt said. “It’s a very, very tough fund-raising market.”In the meantime, service providers — the hired hands of the oil industry who do everything from stack steel pipes to frack wells — will experience extreme pressure, along with the explorers who are demanding price cuts, said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, an indexing and research company. Pipeline owners are somewhat insulated because oil and natural gas still need to be shipped to refiners and export terminals, she said.Shale Threshold“The market is going to be out of balance for quite some time,” Morris said.Yergin, the confidante of oil ministers and chief executives, sees the threshold for reinvigorating shale between $50 and $60 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading above the $50 level as recently as Feb. 26.“At $50, we’ll start to see a recovery and a step up in investment, so long as people feel safe about the price floor beneath them,” he said.It’s funny that Yergin should put it that way. A big part of shale’s resilience lies in its unique geology. Unlike the so-called conventional fields in Saudi Arabia and Russia, North American shale is rock so dense that it doesn’t degrade or collapse on itself if oil production is interrupted. In other parts of the world, disrupting output can do irreversible damage.That’s why the bulk of Chevron’s $4 billion spending cut will take place in the Permian, CEO Mike Wirth said Tuesday. It’s a rare field where production can be turned off almost instantly without adverse long-term impacts.With shale, “the assets don’t go away because you haven’t destroyed the field,” said Ken Medlock, senior director of Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. “We’ll see a thinning of the herd but the assets will still be there.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The small Kansas plant in the heart of rural America was offering just $1.75 a barrel for Wyoming sweet crude.With more than two billion people on virus lockdown from India to California, energy demand has plunged. In corners of the U.S., Canada, Russia and China, oil prices at the well-head are collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented glut.And with it, the industry is bracing for something that last happened on this scale 35 years ago: producers shutting down their wells as pumping crude makes no economic sense.“I have never seen anything like this in the markets,” said Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder of Gunvor Group Ltd., a large commodity trading house. “We’ve never seen anything even close to today.”The oil market — hit by the double blow of a demand slump and a supply surge as Saudi Arabia and Russia wage a price war — is battling a surplus of as much as 20% of global consumption.The consequences are brutal: prices are now low enough to force a widespread suspension of production, or a shut-in as it’s known in the industry. For those waging the price war, it counts as a victory — as long as the shut-ins happen elsewhere.Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarks closely followed in Wall Street, are hovering around $25 a barrel. But in the world of physical oil — where actual barrels change hands — producers are getting much less.The industry is navigating what Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst at Mizuho Bank Ltd, described as “uncharted waters to unknown lands.”Wyoming Sweet, a landlocked crude with few outlets other than American refineries like Coffeyville, is paradigmatic of how the dynamics of the oil market are forcing output cuts. There are others: North Dakota Light Sweet has traded at $9.97 a barrel. Across the border, Western Canadian Select has plunged to $6.45. In Siberia, Russian crude has changed hands for less than $10 and Chinese domestic prices have fallen to single digits.Ultra-low oil prices are starting to work: Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run producer, is cutting output by 100,000 barrels a day from high-cost offshore platforms. Glencore Plc., the commodity giant, is shutting down its oilfields in Chad. In Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. has partially shutdown its Fort Hills oil sands mine.As the pain spreads, industry executives believe many other companies will stem production in the next few days.“We need to cut crude supply by 10 million barrels a day pretty quickly,” said Russel Hardy, the head of top independent oil trader Vitol Group. “Oil prices will need to go lower, to bring the prices to a level that triggers a response.”The last time the oil industry faced widespread shut-ins was in 1986, when Saudi Arabia also ravaged the market in a price war. During the price battles of 1998-99 and 2015-16 the industry also saw cuts, but not on a large scale.Put simply, the world cannot continue pumping at the current level of about 100 million barrels a day while demand is as much as 20% lower. The surplus would overwhelm storage capacity within weeks.In some emerging markets, where infrastructure is less developed, it’s already happening. Pakistan has told refiners to stop importing gasoline and diesel as the tanks are already brimming.Rush to SeaWhere there’s access to the sea, traders use tankers to store oil — and wait for prices to go up. Crude is now moving onto ships at a record pace, according to one of the industry’s largest shipowners.But inland, producers are reliant on sending crude to local refineries like Coffeyville and the lack of storage capacity will be decisive.“The surge in inventory in coming weeks will inevitably saturate local infrastructure, in our view, forcing many inland producers to shut-in wells,” said Damien Courvalin, oil analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Some producers will prefer to take the hit of negative prices — paying someone to take the oil off their hands — to the long-term costs of shutting down a well. In the aftermath of the last major downturn, a North Dakota sour crude went to a negative 50 cents.But as storage fills up, production will have to respond. IHS Markit Ltd., a consultant, estimates the Canadian province of Alberta has inland tanks able to store the equivalent of just 3.2 days of daily production. The central U.S., which includes Wyoming, has room for just 12.8 days’ output.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The credit package was announced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on March 13, but since then the economy has deteriorated.

It also has $55 billion worth of tax deferrals for households and businesses.Parliament approved the government’s fiscal stimulus package early Wednesday.The discussions come at a time when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is also asking banks to provide relief for consumers, including cutting credit card interest rates.“I can assure you that the Finance Minister has had conversations directly with the banks about credit card interest rates. We recognize that they are a significant challenge for many Canadians at this point,” Trudeau said Thursday.Bloomberg.com"

With only an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of storage capacity still available, producers will be forced to cut output because by June there’ll be no place left to put the unwanted crude, it said.The oil market has been hammered by falling demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Saudi Arabia vows to flood the market with crude at deep discounts, following the collapse of the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full. Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, two of the world’s top merchants, say there’s heavy interest in storing while several traders have booked supertankers to hoard barrels at sea.

Supply may exceed demand by 12.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, with other traders, banks and consultants also forecasting bumper surpluses, IHS said. Vitol said on Wednesday that demand has fallen as much as 20 million barrels a day from last year.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”U.S. ConcernsThere are already signs in prices about a potential scarcity of storage space. In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world’s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said. Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up. Saudi Arabia has 18 days, and the U.S. has 30.Nigeria, the biggest producer in Africa, is the most vulnerable among the areas measured by IHS. Estimated first-quarter 2020 daily production of 1.9 million barrels a day would fill up available local storage in 1 1/2 to two days, the firm said.Consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. also sees storage tanks filling in the coming months.“With OPEC pushing output to record highs, inventories will quickly get out of hand,” the firm said in a note. “We will run out of crude storage capacity by early Q3 20, with product containment arriving earlier.”Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada’s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers.

“More stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,” Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They’ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program — between $50 billion and $75 billion — to be announced at the central bank’s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.“The BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,” Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.“There is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy — but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,” Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.“We can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,” CIBC’s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"

Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced. Customers in good standing who have been impacted by the pandemic can apply, with deferrals available for an indefinite period and no deadline to apply, according to the association.Under the plan, payments are skipped for a period of time, and interest accrued is added to the mortgage’s outstanding balance. The additional interest is incorporated into future monthly payments when they resume, or upon renewal at the end of the mortgage’s term.Canadian banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals, since the relief plan was introduced.“Last week, our contact centres in Canada received close to 80,000 calls per day, with calls to our mortgage and loan teams up 500 per cent,” Scotiabank Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter said in a March 22 statement.Toronto-Dominion is “receiving thousands of requests daily for mortgage deferrals, and have processed thousands already,” spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo said in an emailed statement. “We are moving quickly through applications so that we can help provide our customers some immediate financial relief.”Bloomberg.com"

A survey of 1,005 U.S. consumers by MKM Partners found that demand for pot appears to be just as inelastic as demand for alcohol.When asked whether they were spending more or less on various discretionary categories as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, media, alcohol and cannabis were the categories that showed the highest indications of spending.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump’s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn’t require members to travel to Washington — as long as the bill does not have any “poison pills” Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the “the president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation’s economy as we work through this crisis.”The size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation’s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third — and biggest — plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing. It also will send tens of billions in fresh aid to states.Bloomberg.com"

Employees at the plant, who declined to be identified citing company policy, say they’ve been recalled to work and have resumed vehicle-assembly operations.Tesla has roughly 20,000 employees in the San Francisco Bay area and 10,000 at the factory, which makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y. The county warned earlier this week that Tesla appeared to be in violation of its work-stoppage order.

“If the reports we have received are true, Tesla is engaging in work beyond Minimum Basic Operations, and is in violation of the health officer order,” Colleen Chawla, the county Health Care Services Agency director, said in a letter Monday. “We hope that Tesla — like other businesses who have been notified of noncompliance — comes into compliance with the order without the need for additional enforcement measures.”Shares of the company pared a decline of as much as 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, falling 4.3 per cent to US$774.25 as of 12:17 p.m. in New York. California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning that the state is prepared to enforce its stay-at-home rules if needed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.County health officers issued an unusual statement late Tuesday after reviewing the company’s latest safety plan. It said Tesla can prepare “for a possible reopening as soon as next week” if it follows some additional safety recommendations, and public health indicators remain stable or improve. The officials said they would work with local police “to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing, and agreed-upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production.”

Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and largest shareholder, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at the plant in Fremont and would defy the county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He got support from President Donald Trump.The county and six municipalities in the densely-populated region decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let some manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities had the ability to keep stricter measures in place. The Bay area was the first region in the country to lock down via shelter in place orders and has been the most cautious about reopening, citing the need to ramp up testing capacity, contact tracing and making sure that there is an ample supply of PPE, or personal protective equipment.Musk sent an email to employees early Tuesday: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.Two workers who have returned to the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.

The work in Fremont comes as Tesla is actively seeking a new location to build its second gigafactory. Musk has also said that Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas. He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk was not shy about suing Alameda County. Tesla filed suit against the county on Saturday.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen.

But companies are also considering how best to redesign their operations to prevent infections, including by automating some lines altogether. The likely result: higher costs for an industry dominated by the likes of Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS SA that’s been very efficient at pumping out cheap meat.The changes are arriving as concerns mount over mega-plants staffed with low-paid workers operating elbow-to-elbow. More than 10,000 meat workers have been infected by the coronavirus, and at least 30 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.

“Americans want to buy cheaper and cheaper and cheaper food,” said Matthew Wadiak, founder of Cooks Venture, a small chicken producer selling directly to consumers. “We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what’s the cost of a human life? It’s a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout.”Workers at meatpacking plants continue to fall ill, even with barriers placed between them, more protective equipment and enhanced social-distancing measures in common areas including cafeterias and locker rooms.While President Donald Trump has ordered plants to reopen, many are running at slower-than-usual rates to try to reduce the spread. Reducing plants to a third of their capacity and distributing the adequate protective equipment could boost chicken prices at grocery stores by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Sanchoy Das, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what's the cost of a human life? It's a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout 
 
“The 99-cents per pound chicken could be in short supply very quickly,” said Das, whose research focuses primarily on supply chain modelling and analysis.Tyson’s operating costs are sharply higher due to the novel coronavirus and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Chief Executive Officer Noel White and Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said at the BMO Farm to Market virtual conference on Wednesday. That includes US$120 million in bonus for employees, personal protection equipment as well as factory shutdowns and slowdowns.

The bulk of America’s beef and pork are processed in a few dozen giant plants that handle thousands of animals in lines that have been allowed to run faster and faster. Tyson, JBS and Cargill Inc. control about two-thirds of America’s beef. Pork and chicken production is similarly concentrated.The outbreak could also help accelerate automation plans companies have already in the works. Tyson has said it is investing “aggressively” in automating the most difficult tasks within its plants. The company is installing robots in the deboning areas of its poultry plants, and also has initiatives in beef and pork.“You are going to see a bifurcation where the larger, more profitable facilities are going to move toward a vastly more automated meat processing facility,” said Decker Walker, an agribusiness expert at Boston Consulting Group. “Incentives for automation have never been higher.”Incentives for automation have never been higherDecker Walker 
 
Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. was increasing its use of automation and robotics even before the pandemic. The company invested more than US$30 million in automation last year, projects that are helping plants to run efficiently in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.“We believe in automation, we believe in robotics, and we’re going to continue to move down that path,” Chief Executive Officer Jayson Penn said in an April 30 call with analysts.Meat processing is usually a low-margin business, meaning companies will be wary of overspending. While there’s probably going to be a lot of change in the way packers do business, consumers will pay for it in the long run, said Steve Meyer, an economist at consultancy Kerns & Associates.“This whole system was designed to produce quality products at the most reasonable cost possible, so you don’t go and add a lot of extra cost to go handle a once-in-a-100-year situation,” Meyer said. “But you also don’t turn a blind eye to the fact that people are sick and some people died. So I think there will be some changes made.”Another way to reduce infections, especially in poultry plants, would be to produce more whole chickens, as cutting up birds into legs and thighs requires more labor, said Das of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.Consumers in the U.S. can afford to pay a bit more for their meat, said Wadiak of Cooks Venture. That would increase wages and help avoid shared living accommodation, which has been a challenge for meat plant workers looking to adhere to social-distancing practices.“When the budget is tight, it’s hard to put food on the table, it’s hard to feed your family, I really, really get that,” he said. “But if that means you are putting food on your table at the cost of someone else’s life, it’s not worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Earlier this month, an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, also called for Lindsay’s replacement and said the company should divest its energy and coal businesses.Both investors are critical of Teck’s dual-class share structure, which allows the Keevil family — which has been involved with the firm for more than six decades — to control the company.Most of Teck’s A-shares are held by Temagami Mining Co., which is owned by the Keevil family and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Speaking at a Bank of America conference on Tuesday, Lindsay said that only Temagami has the power to dismantle the dual-class structure, which he believes will stay in place “for the foreseeable future.”

Thus far, Lindsay has refrained from commenting directly on the shareholder activism, although the company has issued statements saying he has widespread shareholder support. The miner also says the stock’s decline — 59 per cent in the past year in Toronto — is mostly due to falling commodity prices.Lindsay reiterated that point at the virtual conference and also defended his strategy for the company.“We know that investors tend to be cautious during these phases,” he said, referring to Teck’s “investment cycle” in which it’s ramping up its copper business and trying to boost its steelmaking-coal margins. “We’ve seen something very similar before during financing and construction of another high-altitude copper mine — Antamina — which also coincided with a significant downturn in the market.”‘Penalty Box’Lindsay was referring to construction of the Antamina mine in Peru which was completed in 2001, spokesman Chris Stannell said in an email following the speech.Throughout that period, Teck’s share price was in the “penalty box,” Lindsay reminded analysts. “But our then-CEO and now chairman emeritus Dr. Keevil, he had the vision and the tenacity to see it through.”Since then, Teck has weathered other commodity downturns. In 2015, the company was stripped of its investment grade rating amid the collapse of the commodities supercycle.

They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell’s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March 
 
Worrying ScenarioThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.“Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers’ careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,” Powell said. “The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life’s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.”While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksFed chairman Jerome Powell 
 
Congressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump’s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank’s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.‘Significant’ Risks“While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,” Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would “continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,” but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.“When this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London, which usually trade within a few dollars an ounce of one another, diverged by as much as US$70 — the most in four decades. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.HSBC, which had disclosed in a previous filing that it was hit by the gold market disruption, revealed the scale of the loss in a chart this week showing its daily trading profits for the first quarter.The bank described the loss as a “mark-to-market loss mainly associated with gold refining and transportation challenges.” It highlighted the “unprecedented widening of the gold exchange-for-physical basis,” which “affected HSBC’s gold leasing and financing business and other gold hedging activity leading to mark-to-market losses.”HSBC declined to comment.In the past week, the price difference between the New York and London markets has returned to more normal levels of less than US$5 an ounce.Still, HSBC is not the only one struggling with the unusual moves in the gold market. Banks often sell gold futures in New York to hedge their positions in the London market, exposing them to significant losses should the two markets diverge.As a result, some banks have stepped back from trading the EFP in recent weeks.

While Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities could keep stricter measures in place.Overnight, Musk sent an email to employees: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.

Elon Musk unleashes tweet storm, threatening to pull Tesla out of California over ‘absurd and medically irrational’ shutdown
When asked on Twitter how Monday went at the factory, Musk replied Tuesday: “Great.” Tesla’s shares rose as much as 3.9 per cent as of 11:50 a.m. in New York trading. The stock price has doubled this year.Two workers who have returned to work at the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.Musk’s emailed words of encouragement followed tweets in which he claimed Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas and may even cease manufacturing in California. To follow through on those threats, the CEO would have to uproot many of the roughly 20,000 employees the carmaker has in the San Francisco Bay area. About half of the company’s headcount is at the factory.He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk is waging another legal battle. This time, he’s tangling with health officials over measures to contain a virus that he downplayed starting in January.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Alameda County issued a statement Monday saying Tesla’s Fremont plant was operating beyond what was allowed and that it hoped the company would “comply without further enforcement measures.” The county has been in an ongoing dialogue over employee health-screening procedures and said it will continue to review Tesla’s plans.Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen. The nation’s top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, warned against reopening the economy too soon during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying that doing so risks new coronavirus outbreaks throughout the U.S.Trump’s supportive Twitter post followed words of encouragement that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offered to Musk on Monday.“He’s one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “California should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely.”Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director and Elon’s brother, shared a story on Mnuchin’s remarks with his more than 107,000 followers. “Only California and @GavinNewsom⁩ could make me a Trump fan,” he wrote.Bloomberg.com"

The two dancers on Celebrity Cruises’s Infinity say being held aboard ships for almost two months has left them emotionally drained.“I cried all day,” said Carrick, 29. “We need to have alcohol to sleep — that’s how bad it is. We’re worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home.”Carrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shook the industry and underscored concern about mental health.

The ship set sail from Miami with 900 crew members and no passengers and has been wandering the seas since then.

“It’s a very stressful situation,” said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which represents local unions. “The prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points.”Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship’s crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to Covid-19, the company said. Carnival, the world’s largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker’s family.

‘If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me’: Elon Musk says Tesla will defy California county and reopen car plant
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 line and owner of Celebrity Cruises, said a crew member went overboard from its Jewel of the Seas about two weeks ago.‘Suicidal’ MessagesCrew members have said the reported deaths have rattled them and dampened morale, said Krista Thomas, a former Norwegian Cruise Line guest manager who’s operating two Facebook pages for stranded crew and their families. In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.“Many of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they’re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,” said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. “Many have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.”The cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.“That one simple question – how do we get you home? – turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,” Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. “Each country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions – and they frequently change without notice.”About 15 countries won’t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.

About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.CDC RequirementsThe business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.“This whole experience has been a nightmare,” said Carrick. “I can’t even think of coming back to a ship.”Bloomberg.com"

To stem the spread of Covid-19, it will implement temperature checks, require masks and prohibit lines for toilets, with lavatories made available on request.The carrier’s push to get planes back in the air clashes with comments from U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said Britons were unlikely to be vacationing abroad this summer. O’Leary said practical measures to resume travel should be worked out over the next several weeks.“By the time we get to the first of July, we think masks and temperature checks will become the norm in train stations, on board trains and undergrounds, on buses, in public transport across Europe,” O’Leary said at a Financial Times conference Tuesday. “It would be a reasonably modest extension to add those to airport terminals and on board aircraft.”Ryanair gained as much as 3.8 per cent in Dublin trading. The stock has tumbled 38 per cent this year.‘Unenforcable’ QuarantineTrouble is, within the European Union, each nation sets its own rules on entry. Britain, which just left the bloc but remains a major hub for flights in the region, plans a two-week quarantine on incoming travellers that executives have decried as tantamount to a ban.“The U.K. 14-day isolation is nonsense,” O’Leary said. “There’s no scientific basis for it whatsoever.”While the European Commission is preparing recommendations for removing border controls, the Ryanair tussle highlights the conflicting priorities that could make the resumption of air travel a bumpy one.Lavish Holidays UnlikelyO’Leary said the airline has seen a surge in bookings since announcing its resumption of service early Tuesday, adding that there’s pent-up demand, especially from families, who want to take their typical two-week summer vacations abroad. That’s after Hancock told ITV it’s “unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible this summer.”Spain’s tourism industry, a key driver of the economy, was also dealt a potential blow when the government decreed this week that all people arriving from abroad will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine in “their homes or lodgings.” The measure will stay in force until the current state of emergency is lifted.Ryanair said it would restart flights from most of its bases, and will offer seats starting from 20 euros (US$21.60) one-way. Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.Coordination PlansThe U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.“What it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. “The problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.”The EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a “tourism package” of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers. The EU’s digital chief, Margrethe Vestager, told lawmakers last week that digital contact-tracing apps might “enable at least some traveling during the summer.”Bloomberg.com"

In 2019, Lindsay’s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck’s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company’s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen.

“At our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck’s shareholders for the company’s strategy,” Brown said by phone.Impala’s letter alleges four projects — the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada’s oilsands — have destroyed over $12 billion in value.“It’s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,” Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. “The company’s paying top dollar for underperformance.”It's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsBob Bishop 
 
Impala’s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay’s strategy as lacking “clear direction or coherence,” and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.

As for Teck’s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: “We have been very clear that if we can’t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.”Impala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.“The dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,” Bishop said. Instead, “it has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.”Chair MeetingIn March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck’s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. “These have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we’re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.”Bishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck’s zinc and copper assets. He also said he’s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.“If they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,” he said.Tribeca DemandsTribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck’s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.“If you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,” he said. “The shareholding structure is probably in the ‘undeliverable’ so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.”Bloomberg.com"

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise.Wall Street’s three major averages closed around their session lows.

Amazon doesn’t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday. AMC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The trade publication Deadline reported Monday morning that “there are no talks,” citing unidentified sources.

AMC shares rose as much as US$2.31 to US$6.41 in New York trading. They were up as little as 19 per cent minutes after the Deadline report and were up 36 per cent to US$5.58 at 11:28 a.m. The stock was down 43 per cent this year through last week, battered along with the rest of the cinema industry by a worldwide shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic.AMC’s bonds surged on reports of the talks with Amazon, and were among the top gainers in the U.S. high-yield market on Monday, according to Trace bond-trading data. AMC’s senior subordinated bonds due 2026 were up as much as 10 cents on the dollar to 32 cents, data shows.The reported talks are unlikely to spark a price war for AMC, Bloomberg Intelligence media analyst Amine Bensaid said in a note. “Movie-going is unlikely to fully bounce back in a post-COVID-19 world and may create risks for an acquirer,” he said. “AMC’s elevated debt load and unavoidable fixed costs mean the company’s near-term financial flexibility will be severely challenged.”AMC showed its concern about existential threats with its reaction to last month’s straight-to-streaming release of the kids movie “Trolls World Tour,” which Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures crowed about as a high-grossing success. AMC said it would no longer show Universal’s movies.Chinese real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, who spent billions of dollars building one of the world’s biggest cinema operators, controls AMC through his closely held Wanda Group. Wanda acquired AMC in 2012 for US$2.6 billion as part of its expansion into entertainment. It subsequently acquired Nordic, Carmike and Odeon & UCI Cinemas.Along with its vast retail and web-services operations, Amazon is an active player in streaming with its Prime Video platform, along with releasing original films. Like Netflix Inc., Amazon is eager to shore up its burgeoning position in Hollywood as new and old players scrap for content deals. Buying a theatre chain would guarantee another outlet for its movies.Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley FBR, wrote to clients Monday that a cash offer for AMC, which is on track for its fourth straight year of stock declines, wouldn’t appeal to investors. A cash offer would be more likely than a stock deal, given AMC’s depressed stock price, he said.Bloomberg.com"

The market is in a state of information and position overload, exacerbating the potential for volatile moves.”

A halving happens about every four years and slows down the rate at which new tokens are created — an intentional feature designed to control inflation. Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen into the event and jumped after, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies averaged 446 days.Here’s a QuickTake on what Bitcoin’s “halving” means.“So far, Bitcoin’s third halving looks different to prior events and there doesn’t appear to have been such a sustained price run-up,” said Payal Lakhani, director of equity research and product development at CME Group, in a blog post Friday. “Given the reward change has been known since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, and having already seen two such events, investors may have already incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.”The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in lower volumes as some participants focused on non-crypto markets, and some mining operations being affected by these difficult market conditions, Lakhani said.Bloomberg.com"

Disney is struggling to recoup earnings at its theme park and film businesses pummelled by the virus crisis, while China’s government is grappling with the challenges of incrementally reopening the country. Parks, factories and restaurants in cities and countries around the world are reopening under rules to keep customers and workers apart amid the threat of second waves and flare-ups of the virus.To reach the gates of Shanghai Disneyland, guests had to pass through body temperature checks and show that their health status has been confirmed using a smartphone app for tracking infected persons. Masks were mandatory, despite the muggy 23 degree Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) weather.

New cases in the country where the pathogen first emerged have dwindled, and China has reported no deaths since April 14, according to the National Health Commission.Visitors to the US$5.5 -billion theme park had relatively short waits for rides. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction, for example, had a maximum of five minutes standing in line mid-morning, according to an app that tracks waits at the park. The longest line for a ride at the time was 20 minutes, according to the app.

In the afternoon, some lines started to stretch to 30 minutes, maximum.On a typical spring day under normal conditions, visitors might wait more than one hour for the most popular attractions.The Disney World shop, which sells toys and T-shirts, required use of hand sanitizer to enter, and had few shoppers. Popcorn and chicken wing stands were open, though fewer than on a normal day.Live theatre shows, areas where children would come into close contact, such as water play spots, and parades have been suspended during the initial reopening to avoid raising infection risks.“The real test will come as those capacity limits are eased and the calendar moves into what is typically the critical peak summer season,” said Ron Merriman, managing director of theme park consultants MR ProFun China. “But I am very optimistic about the park’s prospects for passing that test.”

Shanghai Disneyland was the first of the entertainment giant’s parks to close on Jan. 25 as the coronavirus began to spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan, 520 miles (840 kilometres) west of the country’s business capital.Disney blamed the pandemic for lopping US$1.4 billion off profit last quarter, largely by forcing it to shut resorts around the world. While Disney is keeping its U.S., Hong Kong and Paris parks closed, the company said last week it would open a limited number of shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs mall outside its resorts in Orlando, Florida, on May 20.Tickets to Shanghai Disneyland during the initial reopening phase are 399 yuan (US$56) for regular days, and 499 yuan for weekends.Disney’s theme parks division contributed about 46 per cent of operating income in the 12 months ended September 2019, more than double the earnings from its studio entertainment business, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Bloomberg.com"

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.“We began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,” Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure’s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. “We would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.”Brookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn’t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield’s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia’s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure’s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.“Our outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,” Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a ‘swoosh’ shape than ‘U’ or a ‘V’ with the aid of government stimulus. He said he expects most sectors and businesses to return to a more normal environment by the end of 2020 or first half of 2021, assuming there is not significant second wave of the virus.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The last company to surpass Royal Bank’s market capitalization was drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in July 2015. Months later, the value of the Quebec-based company plunged amid controversies over business practices, accounting and drug pricing. Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. — the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. — crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.’s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada’s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck. The telecommunications-equipment maker ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was liquidated.

The dramatic collapse of two Canadian tech giants in a country more known for being hewers of wood and drawers of water has hung over the country’s corporate psyche for years. So Shopify’s rise has been cheered on by many.“I think it’s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,” said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify “should be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it’s tech sector because it’s been remarkable what they’ve done,” he said. Jackson had owned the company’s stock but doesn’t currently have a position. Its U.S.-listed shares have risen by 43 times since the initial public offering at US$17 in 2015.Too Fast?This year’s rally, which has seen the stock double, has drawn its doubters.“On just about any valuation metric, this is one of the most expensive stocks in Techland,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco told clients in a note Wednesday. Shopify also holds the highest sales multiple, though has the largest sales growth outlook, RBC added. The bank rates Shopify with the equivalent of a buy.The rally has made founder and chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, Canada’s fourth-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 39-year-old has added US$2.8 billion to his wealth this year, and is now worth US$6.3 billion. The billionaire has about 7 per cent of Shopify, according to its 2019 proxy circular.

Lutke, a German immigrant with vivid blue eyes and a penchant for tweed caps, began building software to launch an online snowboard store in 2004. It became obvious that the software was more valuable than the snowboards, according to his website profile, and he went on to launch the Shopify platform in 2006. RBC was incorporated in 1869.Shopify sells tools to help companies set up an online store, a business model seen flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic that has shuttered bricks and mortar stores. In April, the company’s chief technology officer tweeted Shopify was handling “Black Friday-level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Amazon ComparisonAt Bloomberg’s Sooner Than You Think conference in New York last year, Lutke said Shopify isn’t competing with Amazon.com Inc. but helping other people do so.“They’ve obviously become the anti-Amazon, they’re all about empowering everybody else except Amazon on the online e-commerce world to be successful and they’ve expanded and expanded their suite of services,” Jackson said.He believes Shopify has the opportunity to keep rising and have a market value of several hundred billion dollars in the years ahead.“They are still just getting going. People who complain they are ‘too expensive’ don’t understand how much revenue and profits they’ll drive in the years ahead,” Jackson said.Bloomberg.com"

The regulator must work with the CME to determine whether the price moves were a one-time occurrence or a reflection of dynamics in the contract that could recur, Berkovitz said in a statement.A rapid plunge in the final minutes of trading on April 20 that pushed prices to below zero thrust one of the world’s most-traded futures into the spotlight. CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said the agency is “conducting a deep dive” to understand the move, but that the negative prices appeared to have been a result of supply and demand related to storage capacity and the global economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.“The WTI contract is a key benchmark in the energy and financial markets,” Berkovitz said in his statement, which was prepared for a meeting of a CFTC advisory committee that he leads. “A futures contract that is disconnected from the physical market cannot serve as a means to discover prices or manage price risks arising from the use of the commodity.”Berkovitz said he’s concerned that many of the same dynamics that drove the move in the May contract haven’t been resolved. The WTI June contract, the next futures to come due, expires on May 19.“There is a high probability that the supply, demand and storage conditions that were present during trading in the May spot month will persist through the upcoming weeks and into the spot month for the June WTI futures contract,” Berkovitz said.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

A representative for Midland, Michigan-based Dow declined comment.The potential divestitures echo moves across the industry to focus on manufacturing chemicals efficiently while hiving off responsibility for running the ground infrastructure, from power supplies to transportation. Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets last year paid Bayer AG and Lanxess AG more than $3.5 billion to take over their chemical park operations, gaining a steady income from long-term service and supply contracts with the companies on site.Dow’s marine and storage operations, known as its Mars unit, includes 136 chemical and liquid hyrdocarbon tanks with 200 million gallons (760 million liters) of capacity, as well as 11 marine docks, according to one of the people. The terminals — including ones in Freeport, Texas, and St. Charles and Plaquemine in Louisiana — are located near railway lines operated by Union Pacific Corp. Open land and unused tank capacity may also be included in a transaction, the person said.More than 70% of Mars revenue last year came from Dow, and the company would seek a 25-year contract with the buyer for marine and terminal services, one of the people said. The business also has third-party customers, most which have a minimum of 15 years remaining on their leases.For the potential rail divestiture, Dow wants a similar long-term partner for infrastructure critical to its manufacturing operations at six sites in North America, another person briefed on the matter said. The plants in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; in Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; and in Alberta, Canada, at Calgary and Edmonton, represent the bulk of Dow’s olefins and polyethlene production capacity.Dow has accounted for more than 75% of its rail business’s revenue, which had a compound annual growth rate of about 7% over the last three years, the person said. The company has offered to sign a 25-year agreement with potential suitors. Other existing contracts have roughly 12 years remaining, on average.The company, led by Chief Executive Officer James Fitterling, has seen its stock tumble 42% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 12% drop for the S&P 500 Index.

A separate proposal, which was coordinated by the investor activist group ShareAction and backed by money managers at Amundi SA and Jupiter Asset Management, called for the phase-out of financing activities to the most carbon-intensive energy companies. It received 23.95% support.The vote could go down as a milestone event because it’s the first climate change resolution at a European bank, and demonstrates how banks’ contribution to global warming remains a top priority for investors. It also showed how shareholders can force banks and other large corporations to use their vast resources to combat climate change and other social ills.“Today’s result shows the value of shareholder engagement with banks on climate change,” said Faith Ward, the Bristol-based chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership. “This resolution came about as a direct result of intensive shareholder engagement over the past year, including the first-ever shareholder climate resolution at a major European bank.”While Brunel was among firms that filed the shareholder resolution and had hoped to see both proposals pass, Ward said the shareholder resolution got more than 20% support, which means it surpassed a threshold that requires Barclays to consult with shareholders and explain the views received and actions taken publicly within six months.The shareholder resolution was put forward in January and urged Barclays to say how it will phase out financing for energy companies that don’t align with the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. As a growing number of investors pledged to support the resolution, Barclays in March put forward its own net- zero alternative, which ShareAction criticized for leaving unanswered questions about the bank’s financing activities in the short term.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said today’s votes send “an unequivocal signal not just to the board of Barclays but to the entire global banking sector that all banks must start to phase out” fossil-fuel financing.“Today’s voting results will send shock waves through the banking industry,” Howarth said. “While Barclays is Europe’s largest fossil-fuel financier, it is far from being the only bank to prop up companies that are driving the climate crisis.”Barclays provided more than 100 billion pounds ($123 billion) of funds to fossil-fuel companies since the Paris climate accord was signed, according to data compiled by Rainforest Action Network, which includes information gathered from Bloomberg.For some, London-based Barclays hasn’t gone far enough to change its trajectory.“Rather than backing a resolution that set out a clear pathway for Barclays to finally end its vast contribution to the climate emergency, the bank chose to hoodwink both shareholders and the public with an alternative option — one with distant targets and no substance,”said Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace U.K.’s head of climate finance. “There is nothing wrong with a net-zero target but, without details of how it will get there, Barclays’s ambition is all show and no go.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

Bombardier burned through US$1.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter, with as much as half of that coming from slow orders for planes and trains, temporary factory shutdowns and the inability to deliver aircraft amid government travel restrictions.

Martel, who used to head the business jets division before leaving Bombardier for a few years to head Canada’s biggest electric utility, Hydro-Quebec, said he hasn’t seen many order cancellations so far. That’s a contrast with December 2014, when cancellations started piling up after oil prices collapsed, he said.“It is moving at a slow pace, there’s no decision being made,” Martel said, adding that customers have asked for information on plane availability and timing as they assess the duration and impact of the pandemic. “We think that when we have more visibility on the pandemic that the activity level will be restarting.”Bigger JetsDemand for bigger private jets seems more solid than for smaller aircraft, Martel said.The Montreal-based company, which suspended its financial forecast in March, said it would offer updated projections when it has greater visibility on the pandemic’s impact.“We have limited exposure today on the light jet versus either 2008 or even 2014,” he said. “We always felt going into those crises that the large-segment market was much more robust. And today, as you know, we are much more dependent on that segment, which makes me believe that our backlog will remain much more solid.”Bloomberg.com"

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.“It will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men’s jobs affected,” according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers — where many women work — is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a “she-cession,” April’s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Construction in CrosshairsBrendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday’s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn’t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. “The hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,” Bernard said by phone.While Friday’s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it’s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University’s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.“That’s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,” Moffatt said. “The job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.”Path to RecoveryThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won’t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.“Once things start to return to normal, it’s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,” Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.“We are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,” Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"

The internet is glutted with second-by-second countdown clocks and the mania is even spurring a hike in hiring by crypto firms worldwide.

Bitcoin breaks through $10,000 level with traders setting their sights on $11,000
Bitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin’s undergone two prior halvings — or halvenings, as they’re sometimes called — which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world’s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017’s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days — should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there’s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin’s halving, he wrote in a recent note.Price PredictionsTo be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor’s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn’t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.“It is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,” Pal wrote in a recent presentation. “It was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.”Jefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly “Greed & Fear” newsletter recommended investors — including institutions — buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token’s prior price surges around the event.“To invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,” he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification “precisely because of its truly decentralized nature,” he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeAntoni Trenchev 
 
Venture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. “Bitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,” he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels. Though the halving may already be priced in, it will lead to huge appreciation over time, he said.“Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it’s by far the best performing asset of the past decade,” he said. “We’re bullish about its future.”Trenchev is seeing “huge” demand for his firm’s products ahead of the coin’s halving. “We’re not hiring because of the halving per se. We’re hiring because the halving has been lifting Bitcoin and will continue to do so,” he said.Hiring HikeA number of crypto exchanges have also embarked on hiring sprees. Kraken LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. are expanding their workforces, as are OkEx and Coinbase Inc.David Janczewski, the chief executive officer and founder of Cardiff, Wales-based Coincover, said any market event that impacts adoption is a positive for his business.“That’s part of what we see — when the last spike happened, we know that an awful lot of people moved into the market because they felt they ought to get in on the action,” said Janczewski, whose firm offers insurance against crypto thefts and scams. “Ultimately, anything that causes the market to be aware, or wider investment markets to be aware of crypto, tends to be a good thing from our perspective.”Bloomberg.com"

Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more “difficult adjustments” would be put forth in the next two weeks. “Days like this are brutal,” he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a “last wave” in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber’s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees. If the case is successful, the companies could be on the hook for substantial new costs that further jeopardize their business models.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

HSBC said that the gold market “became highly illiquid on news of refinery closings,” contributing to its unusual swings in trading profits in March.The price difference between the New York and London markets, usually no more than a few dollars an ounce, blew out to as much as $70. The divergence hit banks that are active in trading the so-called EFP, or Exchange for Physical, the mechanism by which traders switch positions between the New York and London markets.Read More: Nervous Bankers Leave Gold Market Stuck in DisconnectHSBC said that its trading revenue from metals had decreased due to “market volatility and unfavorable valuation adjustments on exchange for physical transactions.” It reported a $1 million loss in metals trading revenue for the quarter, compared with a $38 million profit for the same period a year earlier. The bank has reported metals trading revenues averaging $215 million a year in the past three years.Gold was not the only reason why HSBC’s trading models breached its daily expected profit-and-loss threshold so many times in the first quarter. The bank also cited volatility in credit spreads and interest rates in March, and said there were two unusual profits and one unusual loss in January because of volatility in palladium.

As governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work, Trump said he’s pivoting to “phase two” of the nation’s response to the pandemic, a step that will include disbanding the White House coronavirus task force, a group of public health experts that has been advising the administration on how to confront the outbreak.The president has for more than a month clamored for a return to normal, stuck between the devastating human cost of the pandemic and the calamity that has befallen the economy as social-distancing measures pushed more than 30 million people into unemployment in a matter of weeks.

Tuesday marked the first time he clearly and unreservedly laid out his own cost-benefit analysis of the situation.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said. “But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”On his visit to a Phoenix Honeywell International Inc. factory producing medical masks, Trump encouraged Americans to think of themselves as “warriors” as they consider leaving their homes, a tacit acknowledgment of deep public reservations about reopening the country too soon.The U.S. continues to endure the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 70,000 killed so far.

Speaking separately in an ABC News interview broadcast on Tuesday evening, Trump said closing down the nation was “the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”And while as recently as April 22, he criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for reopening salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and gyms, on Tuesday he was resolute about getting people back to work.“There’ll be more death,” he said. “The virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal.”“But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it,” Trump said. “I think our economy is going to be raging” next year, he added.No Face MaskWhile in Phoenix, Trump encouraged states to ease social-distancing measures and allow businesses to reopen, though he cautioned that it should be done “safely.”Yet the president declined to set an example for the nation by engaging in one government-recommended safety protocol himself: wearing a face mask. As he toured the Honeywell plant, Trump wore only safety goggles. Music from his standard campaign rally soundtrack played over loudspeakers, including Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and Guns N’ Roses’s version of “Live and Let Die.”Senior White House officials also did not don the masks, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend when social distancing isn’t possible. Factory workers, members of the press and other support staff did. Trump also lamented that he had to stand six feet apart from two supporters during his speech, including one who was wearing a sequined denim vest with his campaign slogan.Trump said that “doctors” he didn’t name had advised him to close the economy “for a couple of years.”“I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest that we’ve ever had,” Trump said, referring to what had been the key argument of his re-election campaign. “And then one day they said, ‘we have to close our country.’ Well, now it’s time to open up.”Public-health experts have repeatedly warned the country risks a second wave of infections if restrictions are lifted too early, which could lead to another round of shutdowns and economic damage.Models ‘So Wrong’But even as Trump said a full-scale reopening could lead to more deaths, he expressed optimism the virus would go away. And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a “fire” that could be extinguished “fast.”He also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriorsDonald Trump 
 
“These models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They’ve been so wrong, they’ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they’re wrong,” the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on “faulty assumptions” about mitigation efforts and didn’t represent federal government projections.“The people of our country are warriors,” Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are “somewhat” or “very” worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.“Mike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening. And we’ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,” Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: “No.”Bloomberg.com"

From buying bonds to paying wages, authorities are playing a role in the economy that was unimaginable even a few months ago.To be clear, it’s not like they had much choice. The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market — whether it’s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies — the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come. Cutting and running too soon risks stripping away a vital safety net that both companies and workers may still need. Staying too long risks crowding out private players.Big government may be back, but how long it’s welcome is another story.Global HeadlinesPhase two | President Donald Trump fixed his course on reopening the nation for business, acknowledging that the move would cause more illness and death from the pandemic but insisting it’s a cost he’s willing to pay to get the economy back on track. Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China’s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a “decoupling” of the world’s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the “blame game,” saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. “It’s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,” he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.’s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country’s exit from lockdown. With Europe’s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country’s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled. Trump supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a summit of the five UN Security Council permanent members and sent him a message describing the initiative as a “good idea,” the American ambassador to Moscow told the Interfax news service. Russian mercenaries are engaged in a large-scale effort in Libya to bolster eastern commander Khalifa Haftar providing technical support, direct involvement in combat operations and sophisticated influence campaigns, according to United Nations experts. Ivory Coast arrested 14 soldiers and five civilians on allegations of planning a coup linked to presidential hopeful Guillaume Soro, who was sentenced in absentia last week on charges of embezzlement and money laundering.Tell us how we’re doing or what we’re missing at balancepower@bloomberg.net.And finally … Long a target of the Philippines’ outspoken president, Rodrigo Duterte, the country’s largest media company was ordered to close overnight after its franchise expired.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) — Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a third in six weeks while much of the commodities universe melts down. Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of pandemic-related mine closures, are adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand softened by industrial lockdowns. There will be no swift return to lofty levels last seen over a decade ago, but the metal may still be the only one to end the year with a record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged by a factor of 13 between 2003 and 2007. That hastened a production splurge that put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce more at depressed prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada’s Cameco has suspended production at its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan. Kazakhstan’s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It’s true that almost all metals have seen a blow to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that’s dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers, whose own factories have been shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34 per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others have climbed, too: London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF have recovered from their 2020 nadirs.The real question is what happens next. Even $34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A significant proportion of producers still don’t make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities are sitting on a still-substantial four years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit will keep upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners is close to $55, though existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even an approval today won’t ease the squeeze fast: A new uranium operation takes years.Then there’s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as traditional users find their reactors are aging, and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher: The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide emissions almost equivalent to two years of those related to global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a renewed preoccupation with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses when it comes to a metal that isn’t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling, too. For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund’s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.“The Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,” the company said in a fund document on its website. “The social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.”The fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company’s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.‘Pandemic Effects’The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada’s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely “to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.” The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn’t say how long the freeze would last to “avoid building unrealistic expectations”.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

He promised employees that the McLean, Virginia-based firm will give them at least six weeks’ notice once it decides to reopen those sites.That’s one of the strongest signs yet that legions of industry employees using makeshift work stations at home may have to wait much longer to return to their offices, even as many states begin lifting restrictions on public life. Capital One, which earns most of its revenue from its massive credit card business, said in late March that it had more than 40,000 people doing their jobs remotely online — accounting for more than three-quarters of its workforce.Many major financial firms have yet to publicly set dates for reopening offices as they grapple with numerous challenges, such as how to help employees safely commute, ascend elevators and navigate shared workspaces. And those that have weighed in on the topic have expressed caution. At Citigroup Inc., for example, President Jane Fraser said last month that the firm will conduct its own analyses of risks and won’t necessarily reopen offices just because local authorities issue all-clears.Capital One has spent years investing in technology and was among the first U.S. banks to announce it would transition to cloud computing. Those moves have helped the firm operate more effectively during this crisis, Fairbank said in the memo.Decisions to return will vary by location, dependent on local conditions, he said. Meanwhile, most of the lender’s branches have remained open, serving customers with drive-thru or from behind glass.©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

She said the lender expects that 30 per cent to 80 per cent of employees may continue to work from home at least some of the time. The Toronto-based bank employed about 45,000 people as of Jan. 31.“We’ve been able to maintain continuity of banking services with far more people working outside the office than we ever thought possible,” Malone said Monday in an interview. “We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we’ve proven through this is that’s actually not the case.”

Chief Executive Officer Darryl White has said “a 2.0 version” of the workplace may include the blended home-and-office arrangements, as big employers worldwide reconfigure offices and routines. Malone said Canadian and U.S. branch employees have “by and large” been going into work during the crisis along with a “small amount” of technology and operations employees, while 95 per cent of those in office towers have been working from home.About two-thirds of the firm’s employees are in Canada, while 13,408 are in the U.S. and 1,578 overseas. The post-COVID plan involves more workers at home including “a ton” of employees with hybrid office-and-home roles, and fewer people working solely at company locations, Malone said.“It’s a blended approach of thinking about productivity and flexibility and for us not a return to the way it used to be,” she said. “It’s about an evolution in the way that we work.”We thought it was critical that we were in the office to make something happen, and what we've proven through this is that's actually not the caseMona Malone 
 
As with many companies worldwide, COVID-19 has already upended much of the workforce of Canada’s fourth-largest bank. For example, call-centre agents initially went into offices at the start of the outbreak. Then in the past month, the bank shifted half of its Canadian call-centre staff and 80 per cent of its U.S. agents to home offices.“That’s not a temporary thing,” Malone said. “We don’t have to think about contact centres as just these geographical hubs, and we can use this remote way of working.”The work-from-anywhere trend helps keep employees safe, Malone said. Crowding workers into office towers while dealing with mass transit, elevators and social distancing is “problematic.” She added that the new approach can also present recruitment possibilities.“It allows us to look for new talent in locations where maybe we haven’t before, and tap into talent pools across the country,” she said.The bank has already seen unexpected benefits in deal-making, as investment bankers use time once spent on commuting to communicate with clients.

“Even with the eventual reopening of businesses, sales of non-essential items could be thin gruel compared to the pre-COVID-19 world,” pollster Nik Nanos said by email.There are notable regional differences in the numbers. Residents of Quebec, the French-speaking province with the highest number of cases in Canada, are much more likely to say their spending will decline once the economy reopens, with 41 per cent anticipating a drop in purchases. In British Columbia, where the outbreak is more contained, that number is 28 per cent.

Getting back to business is proving to be no easy task, even as the Canadian economy continues to buckle under the strain of shutdowns. The two neighbouring provinces account for more than 55 per cent of the country’s GDP but have been the epicentre of its virus cases, with 93 per cent of Canada’s deaths as of Monday.Hospitals ‘Very Tight’The next dilemma for Quebec is whether to stick to a planned May 19 reopening of primary schools and daycares in Montreal. “It’s out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitals, while we have very little room for maneuver in Montreal,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.Most of Quebec’s 1,772 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the Montreal region, which has enough beds for now but where the situation is “very tight,” he said.Quebec’s death tally rose to 2,280 Monday, with 32,623 confirmed cases. Deaths now register 267 per million people, higher than the U.S. at 208 and more than double Canada at 101, according to Quebec’s public health institute. The problem for both Quebec and Ontario has been severe outbreaks at long-term care facilities, which account for about 80 per cent of fatalities.It's out of the question to open and then add to the number of people who could end up in our hospitalsQuebec Premier Francois Legault 
 
Meanwhile, fresh evidence arrived Monday that the economic strain continues to build. Figures showed companies took out loans at the fastest pace since 1981 in March. Employment data due on Friday may show the economy lost more than 4 million jobs in April, a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decline on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Still, stores outside of Montreal were allowed to reopen Tuesday with manufacturing and construction still planned to restart everywhere in Quebec on May 11.In Ontario, only a handful of businesses were allowed to get back to business on Monday, including garden centres offering curbside pickup, automatic car washes and a few more essential construction projects. Ontario has 17,923 cases and 1,300 deaths.However, the province is getting close to relaxing restrictions on retail if infection numbers continue to improve, Ford said.“It’s inevitable. The numbers keep going down. We’re going to get the economy going based on health and science,” he said at a news conference in Toronto. “Just because we open up these stores it doesn’t mean it’s a free-for-all.”Bloomberg.com"

That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It’s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it’s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau. While postings have been down significantly on a year-over-year basis, they started to level off toward the end of April, figures from Indeed Canada show. The services sector has been hardest hit particularly within tourism, education and food services.Labor market destruction isn’t unique to Canada.

That’s on top of 500 positions that were eliminated in early March when it closed two facilities in British Columbia.“When you have the largest cannabis company in the world laying off 700 people, that’s a signal of what’s going on in the broader market,” Humiston said. “We were already seeing that on the full-time side of our business and then COVID-19 came and exacerbated it.”Not everyone is cutting back, however.

It’s been hiring employees for both segments of the business, as well as for its dispensaries, said CEO Kim Rivers.At first Trulieve was hiring to replace people who had to take time off, but “at this point it really is actual hiring, adding to the workforce,” Rivers said in a phone interview. Despite the pandemic, Trulieve opened a new dispensary in Titusville, Florida on April 18 and plans to open another one in the next week or so.Rivers said it remains to be seen whether the pandemic-related expansion remains in place once things return to normal, but she’s hopeful Trulieve will be able to keep the employees it’s hired.“We prefer to not lose folks who have experience within the company, and there may be other roles that folks could shift into as well because we are continuing to grow,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Tim Bray, a vice president and veteran engineer with the company’s cloud-computing division, said in a post on his personal blog that he quit “in dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.”Bray, who was born in Alberta, went to University of Guelph and who worked in Vancouver, was a distinguished engineer, a coveted title large tech companies award to senior technologists. The decision will likely cost him more than $1 million in loss of salary and unvested Amazon stock, “not to mention the best job I ever had,” he said. Amazon has been fighting the spread of coronavirus cases in its logistics network and a public-relations battle against critics who say the company hasn’t done enough to make warehouses safe. Small groups of workers at facilities around the U.S. have walked off the job in protest, and an employee activist group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, called for corporate employees to call in sick after two of its members were fired.Amazon has said the workers were fired for violating corporate policy forbidding them from speaking publicly about internal matters. The company declined to comment on Bray’s resignation.

 He said he believed both that Amazon was making massive investments to keep workers safe during the pandemic, and that workers who have spoken out have legitimate concerns. In the essay, Bray said the company was treating warehouse workers like “fungible units of pick-and-pack potential.” He chalked up some of what he sees as Amazon’s failings to its success in a capitalist system not set up incentivize good treatment of workers.“Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them. It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don’t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things. We don’t need to invent anything new; a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward, Bray wrote.Don’t say it can’t be done, because France is doing it.”“Firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets,” Bray wrote. “It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”Bray, whose last day was Friday, said that Amazon Web Services, the division he worked for, treated workers humanely and “is by and large an ethical organization.”Bloomberg.com"

Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said this year’s event will likely lack “the celebratory feel that it had in the past.”There’s clearly very little to celebrate with the world in lockdown. In one of Buffett’s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a “big one-two punch.”His Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse.

OccidentalBuffett’s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett’s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental’s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire’s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW’s Shields.“I certainly don’t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, ‘Hey, this is expensive, but it’s got this great ringing endorsement,’ because that’s not how it’s working out,” Shields said.Berkshire’s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Insurance ClaimsChubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers’ compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire’s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers’ compensation insurance.“It’s so different based on the insurance product line,” Shields said. “There are some lines that have major questions,” especially with business-interruption coverage.Succession QuestionsBuffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire’s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire’s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year’s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year’s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.“It’s really, really important,” Shields said. While there’s no indication that any change would happen now, “at some point in time, it’s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it’s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.”Pandemic FalloutCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways. See’s Candies began furloughing workers in early April due to the shutdown of its stores. On the other hand, analysts at UBS Group AG expect an improvement in BNSF’s margins in the first quarter.Munger told the Wall Street Journal that Berkshire will probably have to shut some small businesses, though the story didn’t name any specific units.Still, Berkshire’s breadth — with businesses in energy and retail and industrial operations — gives the conglomerate a sense of the broader economy, especially through units such as the railroad, BNSF.“Buffett has access to a set of data about the U.S. economy through all of his subsidiaries,” Cook said.Bloomberg.com"

The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board.

“There’s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,” said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn’t received the letter. “I can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,” Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.

“The Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck’s management,” Sheila Murray, Teck’s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada’s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.Stock PlungeThe activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company’s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because “enough is enough,” Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca’s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world’s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn’t working with other investors. Teck’s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Management MovesLast year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn’t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck’s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.“There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,” the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years 
 
Teck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada’s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.“I don’t see this as a ‘Keevils or nothing’ issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,” Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.ESG PushThe hedge fund’s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn’t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund’s investments are in oil transportation and service providers. The metallurgical coal produced by Teck is used mainly for steel making and not for burning in power plants.Even so, it believes that cutting off oil and coal would attract the rising pool of pension funds and family offices that are restricting their investments in companies based on their environmental impact.“You can either do something now and see a material upside or you can continue to de-rate and be an orphan stock in the global materials universe,” Cleary said.Bloomberg.com"

Elon Musk and Tesla bulls are so over this COVID-19 panic
“It was vintage Elon. I wish he hadn’t done it,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “But most investors don’t care. It doesn’t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.”The stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.“It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,” Tesla said in its quarterly update. “Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.”During the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to “comfortably” exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.“Gross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. “On the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn’t talk about demand at all.”Tesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla’s semi truck again to 2021 — roughly two years later than initially planned — as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.“Tesla investors are looking past the June quarter,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. “The bulls could take this and run.”Bloomberg.com"

Sales rose 15 per cent to US$35 billion. That compares with average Wall Street estimates for US$1.28 a share in profit and US$34 billion in sales, according to Bloomberg data. Analysts had reduced projections in the past month after Microsoft cautioned sales wouldn’t meet forecasts in its PC software and hardware business.Microsoft is better positioned to weather the COVID-19 pandemic than some technology peers because Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella for years has been moving the company to focus on cloud software. As the virus shut down workplaces, the company has seen increasing demand for internet-based Office and conferencing software that keeps employees connected and productive at home. Much of Microsoft’s software is also now sold by subscription, which means customers generally keep paying even amid a slowdown.“Microsoft revenue is less consumer-centric and far more recurring, and when you go to a subscription, you have a pay-for-it-or-lose-it mindset,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.Microsoft shares rose 1.5 per cent in extended trading following the report. Earlier, they closed at US$177.43 in New York. The stock has gained more than 13 per cent in 2020, giving the company a market value of US$1.35 trillion — making it the biggest U.S. publicly traded company.Bloomberg.com"

U.S. Federal Reserve holds rate, warns of hardship caused by coronavirus: Read the official statement
Officials Wednesday left unchanged their vague guidance on the future path of rates. The statement repeated language from March 15 saying the committee would keep the benchmark target range near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”U.S. stocks held gains after the Fed’s statement while yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged up slightly to 0.62 per cent.Regarding asset purchases, the FOMC used wording similar to last month, saying the buying of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will continue “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.”Time frame extendedWednesday’s statement acknowledged the extent and breadth of the damage being wraught by the ongoing contagion.“The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world,” the committee said. “The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.”It made specific mention of lower oil prices and their role in holding down inflation.Policy makers also began to extend cautiously the time frame within which they see the economic blow from the virus lasting, though they are still offering no precise forecast.Medium Term“The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,” the committee said.The central bank has mounted an unprecedented push to limit the economic harm of the virus, which has plunged the global economy into recession and likely sent U.S. unemployment well above 10% after businesses shuttered to slow the contagion.Government data released earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 4.8 per cent rate in the first quarter, the largest drop since 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank’s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed’s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"

"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Katia Dmitrieva,America’s longest economic expansion is over — and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun,"GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low",https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg,"April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT","The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world’s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus’s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn’t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what’s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP — the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 — compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn’t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",K. Oanh Ha,Legal jargon on cruise tickets may foil class-action suits,"‘If you print out one of these tickets, it's like 20 pages of gobbledygook. Most people have no idea the limitations they're presented with’",https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/legal-jargon-on-cruise-tickets-may-foil-virus-class-action-suits,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cruise.jpg,"April 29, 2020 5:01 AM EDT","After two passengers on their luxury cruise tested positive for Covid-19 in March, Emilio and Barbara Hernandez were so frantic to get off the ship, they wrote a note to the captain.The Costa Luminosa sailed on with them still onboard, and they ended up with the virus. Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers’ lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits – lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That’s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that’s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.“These claims are enormous – nothing the industry’s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,” said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry’s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn’t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes’ case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an “uphill battle,” Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers’ tickets. “Provided that’s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.”Range of ProtectionsIt’s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.“If you print out one of these tickets, it’s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. “Most people have no idea the limitations they’re presented with.”For example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it’s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines “took immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,” said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. “Importantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes’ tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a “patently unfair” prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged “significant hurdles” for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted “intentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus” for which there’s no vaccine.If the case isn’t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs’ law firms that pursue them do so on a “no win, no fee” basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.Suits’ Allegations“The ship never should have sailed,” Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. “They put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.”He and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship’s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was “not even connected to any flu-like symptoms,” said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator’s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes’ cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship’s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn’t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik’s office said it’s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak “has focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.” She said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival’s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they “may have been exposed.” It was then – two weeks after the voyage began – that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company’s response was reasonable under the circumstances. “This is a generational global event — it’s unprecedented,” he said.Inspections QuestionedBefore the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there’d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers’ experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn’t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes’ lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival’s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean’s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships “typically perform extremely well” during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven’t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. “There are still a lot of ifs” about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.“The industry hasn’t had any calamitous losses – nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,” Klein said.  Bloomberg.com"

Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open. In Canada, Cargill Inc. has idled its beef plant in High River, Alberta, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s processing capacity while JBS SA’s beef plant in Brooks, Alberta, is running at about half capacity.Quebec-based Goodfood Market Corp., which delivers meals on a subscription basis, said it will be substituting its regular boneless chicken for bone-in thighs, legs and drumsticks as the poultry industry shifts away from de-boning to ramp up production.

New Meat SelectionGrocers generally are accepting cuts of meat that require more cutting by their in-house butchers to keep their meat counters as full as possible, said Michael Young, president of Canada Beef.Meat such as sirloin and strip loins that would have typically been sent to restaurants before the pandemic shuttered businesses are now increasingly sold by retailers who are offering them in different sizes to get the price point down, he said. Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called “end cuts” from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks — from the leg of a cow — on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Larger PackagesConsumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill’s protein and salt businesses. While the company’s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.“We know they’re buying cuts that they’ve never bought before,” Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there’s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors’ Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said. A lot more ground meat is typically sold by comparison, which causes an imbalance.“We’re just waiting to see if enough has changed to eat our way out of the problem,” Allen said.Bloomberg.com"

The video is followed by an explanation in English and Spanish. Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world’s largest online retailer. A vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease’s spread within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it’s safe to show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon’s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off — no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon’s efforts echo what’s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic.

Amazon hasn’t said how many of its workers took unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon’s new safety procedures firsthand. Employees who feel they can’t return because they’re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She’s since returned. “I would have stayed home again if they didn’t make the changes they have,” she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is “providing flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” a spokeswoman said in an email. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.” The company said it doesn’t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.

The coronavirus first struck Amazon’s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus’s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company’s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building’s top manager wasn’t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn’t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn’t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it’s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor — ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they’re being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a hallway.

Despite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon’s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. “We have full shifts in all departments, but it’s seasonal workers,” said Jaylen Camp, who works at a facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. “It’s all new people surrounding me daily,” said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week New York’s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing protective gear. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse.         View this post on Instagram           Today's visits by our founder and CEO @JeffBezos to say thank you to Amazon fulfillment center and @WholeFoods employees.

A post shared by  Amazon (@amazon) on Apr 8, 2020 at 9:05pm PDTSome employees wonder how Amazon will safely accommodate returnees in buildings rearranged to separate workstations and keep people from congregating. Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren’t eligible. An Amazon spokeswoman later said the decision had been reversed.Other employees plan to return to work. One worker at a warehouse in Connecticut, who decided to work part-time as cases spread nearby, said she can’t afford to lose the paycheque. “Everyone thinks it’s just about sick people staying home, but it’s more than that,” she said. “My kids aren’t in school. The unpaid time basically meant that I’ve had a flexible schedule which has allowed me to do what I need to for my girls.”Bloomberg.com"

He didn’t elaborate.

The order, though, will not be limited to Tyson, the person said. It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump’s order sets the stage for a showdown between America’s meat giants, who’ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who’ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products 
 
The White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down. Meat stocks rose on the news.But a union representing plant workers accused the administration of failing to develop meaningful safety requirements that would have helped contain the disruptions.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” said Stuart Appelbaum, President of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.‘Breaking’ Supply ChainTyson Foods extended gains, jumping as much as 5.6 per cent for the biggest intraday advance in three weeks. Hormel Foods Corp. rose 1 per cent, while JBS SA’s American depositary receipts climbed 4.6 per cent.On Sunday, Tyson Foods Chairman John Tyson said in a blog post that the U.S. food supply chain “is breaking,” with millions of pounds of meat set to “disappear” as plants close.Illnesses in the meat-processing industry and shifts in demand after restaurants closed have disrupted the supply chain. Dairy farmers are dumping milk that can’t be sold to processors, broiler operations have been breaking eggs to reduce supplies and some fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields amid labor and distribution disruptions.

Many low-income Americans, meanwhile, have been waiting in long lines at food banks, which have reported shortages.Asked about the country’s food supply, Trump said: “There’s plenty of supply.”The Defense Production Act allows the government broad power to direct industrial production in crises. Trump has previously invoked the law — or threatened to invoke it — in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa’s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities “as soon as it is possible to do so safely.” Iowa produces one-third of the nation’s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Sick WorkersAcross the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with “depopulation and disposal methods” for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African swine fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs.Bloomberg.com"

The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers — a sign of just how distorted the market has become.

The spectre of production shut-downs — and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies — was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It’s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.“We are moving into the end-game,” Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. “Early-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.”In theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it’s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameTorbjorn Tornqvist 
 
The best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.“Monday really focused people’s minds that production needs to slow down,” Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. “It’s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.”Trafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. “The severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,” said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.

North Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state’s total.The output cuts won’t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.“I wouldn’t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,” Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. “In certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.”In emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that’s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it’s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What’s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.

Before the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.Refiners ShutBut before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate. U.S. oil refiners processed just 12.45 million barrels a day on the week to April 17, the lowest amount in at least 30 years, except for hurricane-related closures.More refinery shutdowns are coming, oil traders and consultants said, particularly in the U.S. where lockdowns started later than in Europe and demand is still contracting. Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, said that global refineries could halt as much as 25 per cent of total capacity in May.“No one is going to be able to dodge this bullet.”Bloomberg.com"

Given the lack of crude demand coupled with low Canadian pricing and little in the way of extra storage capacity, “it is hard for us to fathom how Western Canadian crude production can avoid a ~1 million+ bbl/d drop in output in the coming weeks,” Stifel FirstEnergy analyst Michael Dunn told clients in a note.The virus has disrupted the industry’s operations as well. Imperial Oil Ltd.’s Kearl oilsands mine has been struck by an outbreak of the virus that has sickened at least 32 workers. TC Energy Corp. has said social-distancing measures may slow construction on projects such as its Coastal GasLink pipeline.Here’s what analysts are saying ahead of earnings:RBC, Greg PardyEnergy firms will further trim capital spending, update their efforts at cost reductions and potentially adjust dividend levels.“Liquidity measures appear sufficient for most companies to bridge the gap in 2020, but next year could be another story,” Pardy said.Morgan Stanley, Benny Wong“Expect the market to look past anticipated weak 1Q prints and focus on liquidity and ability to cut, store, & place production.”Wong sees integrated firms carrying an advantage in navigating storage woes. He sees the highest negative cash flow revision risk for Cenovus and Husky heading into earnings results.Canaccord, Dennis Fong“Shut-ins and the residual impact of strong Q4 diluent pricing could further weigh on oil sands cash costs (in addition to significantly lower realized pricing).”Suncor remains Canaccord’s top pick among large-cap producers.Bloomberg.com"

The fund said it’s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn’t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold “significant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.”

The ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it’s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.“While it is USO’s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,” it said in the filing, adding that USO investors “should expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO’s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.”Easy TargetThe US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn’t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including “a change in regulator accountability levels and position limits” as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that’s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that’s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"

Big box shopping centres and community strip malls took in only a little over half their expected rent.“I’ve been in this business over 30 years and I have never seen anything as catastrophic or as impactful in a negative way in our business,” Tim Sanderson, who heads retail at JLL Canada, said in an interview. “It’s the mid-tier smaller-scale landlord that cannot make their mortgage payments to their lender that are going to be in trouble.”

Malls and main-street shops, bastions of community commerce, were already under pressure after two years of weak retail sales, rising property taxes and the shift to e-commerce. Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online — even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That’s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year — a level Sanderson describes as “very tight.”“Many retailers are in trouble,” Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. “I think when we get to the other side of this, there’s a real reckoning to be had.”I think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadRoelof van Dijk 
 
Much will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country’s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country’s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can’t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That’s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.“To be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive — I would guess that some of the ones that won’t survive maybe weren’t in such good shape when this started,” he said in an April 21 interview. “Where we think the tenant should be able to survive, we’re certainly open to discussing further help.”Still he’s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.“Once people feel safe and comfortable — and that may be a full year before we’re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer — I think people will go back to their basic habits,” Sonshine said. “They want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym — all of which nobody can do right now.”Bloomberg.com"

While the second name has yet to emerge in public, BlackRock Inc.’s Jean Boivin is no longer in contention. Tiff Macklem, dean of the University of Toronto’s management school and a former central bank official, regularly features in speculation, though it’s unclear whether he has sought the position.

Whoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that’s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada’s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank’s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.

“You need someone forceful,” Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “There does have to be some push back.”The outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today’s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons — the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada’s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank’s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that’s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion — a gap that’s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulMark Chandler 
 
With the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada’s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada’s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. “Someday the tensions will ease back and we won’t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,” the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts. It’s one thing for the central bank to finance income support measures, another for it to fund agendas.In the short term, it’s all academic. With the economy in crisis and inflation nowhere in sight, keeping the taps open is the only option.Bloomberg.com"

Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has “completely changed everything,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.

“People are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,” he said. “That really changes the mindset of a consumer.”Some of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.‘Health Halo’Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world’s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that’s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico’s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That’s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.“There is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,” said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.

It might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days.

“It moved in waves, but everything is moving,” he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That’s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they’re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching “Tiger King” on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That’s why there’s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium’s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world’s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.“There’s a simplification going on,” Fereday said. Packaged foods are “certainly more available because there’s more output, and people will remember that. When there was nothing left to eat, these companies delivered.”Bloomberg.com"

Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers’ digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu — or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province’s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe’s Cos. Inc. in Canada and Alexandre Taillefer, a private equity partner who years ago floated the idea of a Quebec response to Amazon’s dominance.

“People will be able to see what’s available in their region,” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said in an interview. “There’s a solidarity developing, I want to capitalize on that.”Quebec’s nationalism, which is rooted in the 1960s economic and political emancipation of its French-speaking majority, predisposes the population to close ranks behind local businesses, according to Andre Lecours, a professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa. The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company’s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.“There’s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,” Lecours said. “Still, let’s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it’s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?”Efforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch — including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.’s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV’s beer.

When Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer — an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.“An initiative to promote local commerce isn’t an initiative against free trade,” Fitzgibbon said then. “It’s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.”The Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn’t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it’s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the “Buy Quebec” movement to stay.“No one can compete with Amazon,” she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don’t sell on the behemoth’s platform, “we have some exclusivity they don’t have.”‘I Made No Money’Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.’s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling “Black Friday level traffic every day” to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault’s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.“I made no money,” he said. Shipping costs “is what’s hurting everyone.”Taillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket’s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers’ attention.“Our goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,” he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, “it will have been worth it.”Bloomberg.com"

Brazil, the world’s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world’s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.“It’s absolutely unprecedented,” said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. “It’s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.”

New U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world’s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin.

The most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.“During this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation’s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,” Smithfield said in a statement Friday. “It’s an awful choice; it’s not one we wish on anyone.”Prices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike’s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.“We’re backing it up already because of the coming — we feel — the coming shortages,” said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven’t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn’t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn’t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there’s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world’s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country’s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don’t have a place to sell their animals. That’s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It’s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That’s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on “depopulation and disposal methods.”

It’s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling — so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as “elbow-to-elbow.” Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there’s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day — it’s basically the opposite of social distancing.Sick InspectorsAt the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That’s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there’s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS’s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant “are fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.” The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that “employee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.”The closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.“Brazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don’t see progress in agglomeration of people,” said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. “They are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Esteban Duarte,Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces,Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government — which could trigger a downgrade,https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg,"April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT","Canada’s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country’s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada’s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada’s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days. 
Shockproofing Canada: Here’s what it will take to reopen the economy
Alberta’s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility
How to help the provinces weather the COVID-19 economic shock
Last week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.“There is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point” for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.A ‘Weak’ AAACanadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada’s profile as similar to Australia — whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 — and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada’s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.“The fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low — I think that will be very important for the credit rating,” said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada’s top credit rating as “extremely resilient,” citing the central government’s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is “among the weak” AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn’t an automatic trigger for a credit action.Implicit SupportWhile the federal government doesn’t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador’s rating of A1 by Moody’s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of “a high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,” Moody’s said in an April 1 statement. Moody’s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It’s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.“We still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,” said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.“Oil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,” said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That’s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.“Provincials are absolutely key for Canada’s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,” said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces’ credit ratings may be “called into question.”Bloomberg.com"

The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple’s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple’s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel’s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company’s first custom Mac chips won’t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple’s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company’s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple’s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple’s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro’s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company’s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel’s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel’s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel’s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple’s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems — chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls — after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel’s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"

That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett’s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. “We’ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won’t reopen when this is over,” he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.“There’s no fortress that’s immune to that right now,” said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book “Margin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.”Some Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See’s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire’s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett’s promise that Berkshire will “forever remain a financial fortress” hasn’t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.“It’s nowhere near business as usual, of course,” he said in an interview. “But keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there’s a coronavirus pandemic.”Schnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he’s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn’t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.’s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire’s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett’s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren’t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this “typhoon,” Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire’s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett’s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett’s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. While Buffett has yet to announce a similar deal recently, shareholder Thomas Russo said Buffett’s ability to evaluate unique opportunities may help again.“He’s patient,” said Russo, who oversees about US$10 billion including Berkshire shares at Gardner Russo & Gardner. “One of the best features is that he is able to see opportunities broadly.”Buffett, 89, is set to host a virtual version of Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, an event that normally draws thousands of visitors to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Investors hope he’ll have the “washtub” that he described in his 2017 annual letter:“Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold,” Buffett wrote. “When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.”Bloomberg.com"

A survey of CFIB members shows 80% of small and medium firms are closed or operating at reduced capacity because of the pandemic, meaning only 20 per cent are fully operational.“Even in the optimistic scenario with full utilization of all of these support programs, I still see no scenario under which there are not tens of thousands of permanent business closures,” Kelly said Wednesday by phone from Toronto. 
How to apply for the government's $25-billion CEBA business loan program
Small businesses need to be a focus of COVID-19 support, not an afterthought
Ottawa planning rent relief program for smaller businesses
The federal government has stepped up aid to businesses, introducing measures such as a 75 per cent wage subsidy and $40,000 loans, and a rent relief program is expected soon. But the measures weren’t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren’t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government’s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario.“The bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that’s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,” Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Take ‘Months’Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. “It’s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.”And if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.“It doesn’t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,” Yussuff said. “This is a very difficult time so workers don’t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.”Bloomberg.com"

After some discussion, the client agreed to put the piece of jewelry up for auction at the major spring sale at Sotheby’s New York, which was supposed to be held in late April.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Live auctions were called off, and Sotheby’s pivoted to online sales. With global economies faltering, U.S. equity markets whipsawing, and people stuck at home indefinitely, the success of online jewelry sales was far from certain. Becket called the bracelet’s owner “and told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale or deferred to a live auction at a later date.”But to Becket’s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well — very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. “Clients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,” she says. Some, Becket adds, told her “they’re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.”Everyone, she says, “is waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.”The results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby’s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.“What we’re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,” Becket says, “and actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.” A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of £90,000 (US$110,000) sold for £162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for £50,000, above a high estimate of £32,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that “I could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we’d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.” The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.Investment PotentialThe rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.“Polished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,” Rapaport wrote, while “shipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel’s plummeted by 73 per cent.” Meanwhile, “inventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.”If buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.“I don’t think people were buying for the sake of investment,” Becket says. “We had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.” It’s true, she continues, that “there has been a softening” in the auction market for jewelry as the value of loose stones has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.“The Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,” she explains. “The stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,” because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. “So the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.”A Million Dollars, Sight UnseenNow the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost a million dollars on a bracelet they’ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says, people are most willing to buy things with which they’re familiar: a Cartier “Love” bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a “broadening” of what’s done well at auction. “A multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn’t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,” she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers’ willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.“If these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,” she says, “where people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.”Bloomberg.com"

Risk-reward is not attractive and it’s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York.

Brian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is “somewhat surprising” given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company’s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify’s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not “necessarily equate to sales volume.”A likely recession, “if we’re not in one already,” will inevitably see a downturn in sales as “no one is immune” to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify’s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify’s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada’s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"

The strong demand comes at a time of supply disruptions as food makers adapt to dramatic shifts in buying patterns and some processing plants close as workers fall ill. As a result, stores are restricting purchases to prevent items from vanishing from shelves. For shoppers, that can be unnerving.“It’s not a shortage, it’s just that it needs to get from the supplier throughout the supply chain to the stores,” said Diane Brisebois, president and chief executive officer of the Retail Council of Canada. “There’s been an unexpected increase in demand for those products, and if those demands continue, it might take a bit longer to get them to the shelves.”

Overall, there’s enough retail supply, said Heather Garlich, a spokesperson for FMI, a food industry association that represents retailers and producers.But there have been “sporadic challenges” with high-demand products, and 49 per cent of U.S. shoppers report their supermarket has had products out of stock, according to the industry’s tracking. On popular items, “they could consider limits based on where the grocer may be located and when their supplier or wholesalers can get them product,” Garlich said.The dizzying variety of foods on grocery shelves has long been a trademark of North American supermarkets. That’s now changing, leaving shoppers worried. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus to making more of just a few core products, which makes it easier for retailers to restock supplies.

“The thing I’m struck by, in the U.S., we’re so used to walking down a supermarket aisle and having thousands of choices,” said Heidi Heitkamp, a former North Dakota Senator and current member of alliantgroup’s strategic advisory board. “Now that’s not what people see on the shelves and it’s a little unnerving. But what everyone should be grateful for is that you can walk into any supermarket in a major metro area and you can find food to eat. That’s a critically important national security concern.”There are signs that panic buying is waning and shoppers are returning to more traditional patterns. U.S. packaged food sales rose 24 per cent in the week ended April 4 from a year ago, slowing from a gain of 32 per cent a week earlier, according to data compiled by Nielsen. Limits on the number of visitors per store are also affecting sales.Costco Wholesale Corp.’s sales rose in March but not as much as expected. Limits placed on its operations to cope with coronavirus-related demand slowed growth in the back half of the month.

“I honestly think rationing may disappear at some point over the next few weeks because expectations have changed a little bit,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “People have come to accept what’s happening right now.”And while meat aisles remain stocked, the spread of coronavirus among North American slaughterhouses is raising concerns of a shortfall in pork and beef at grocery stores. The shutdown of major U.S. processing plants, including Tyson Foods Inc.’s Waterloo plant in Iowa this week, means more than 15 per cent of the nation’s hog-slaughtering capacity is down.“Once we see the impact of workers testing positive in the packing plants, we’re going to see a shortage of meat,” said Heitkamp, the former senator.Bloomberg.com"

Season four of “The Crown,” an award-winning drama about British royals, is already in post-production, as is “Over the Moon,” an animated project.“We work really far out relative to the industry,” Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. “We don’t anticipate moving things around.”Over the past decade, Netflix has lured more than 180 million customers to its streaming service by offering a never-ending buffet of new shows. Seemingly nothing — not debt, not competition, not bad reviews — could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries.

But the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show “Stranger Things,” as well as a movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.With a lineup that includes “Too Hot to Handle,” “Black AF” and “Space Force,” Netflix isn’t going to run out of shows this quarter. It also has the rights to the Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance,” which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last quarter.“No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages and post-production) will play out,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie “Klaus,” and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It’s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can’t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix “The Lovebirds,” a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things” fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can’t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What’s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That’s why Netflix has minimized the impact of rival studios pulling popular programs like “The Office” and “Friends.”Bloomberg.com"

The average selling price for all homes was $819,665. Detached homes fell 4.6 per cent, dropping just below $1 million.“The state of emergency measures currently in place, including the necessary enforcement of social distancing, has impacted the real estate market in many ways,” TRREB President Michael Collins said in the statement. “Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and indeed their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction.”Home sales declines will likely be steepest in the second quarter as social-distancing measures remain in place for most of the spring, said TRREB. The real estate group forecasts that average prices for the year will likely remain near 2019 levels.“As we recover from this temporary downturn, potentially later this year, home buyers will move off the sidelines in increasing numbers as they satisfy pent-up demand for ownership housing,” said the board’s chief market analyst, Jason Mercer. “Increasingly, these buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the onset of COVID-19.”Bloomberg.com"

Netflix forecasts 7.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter — a great quarter under normal circumstances. But investors, who sent the stock to new highs this week, may have wanted more. Though they initially bid Netflix shares up as much as 12% after the close Tuesday, the rally soon fizzled. The stock was little changed as of 5:38 p.m. in New York.“Like other home-entertainment services, we’re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth,” the company said in a letter to investors. “We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends.”

Netflix heard the complaints: You can now turn off that annoying autoplay
How many people really are watching ‘The Mandalorian’? Data firms offer numbers that Disney and Netflix won’t
While COVID-19 has been devastating to the global economy, video-streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have found a captive audience. The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.“What we’re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,” said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter’s results reflected two of Netflix’s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as “The Irishman” and “The Two Popes,” Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. “Tiger King,” about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since “Stranger Things,” according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, “Love Is Blind,” a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, “Too Hot to Handle,” has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally — even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday’s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.“I understand the caution around the response to the stock,” Grous said, before adding, “But we’re not focused too much on quarter to quarter. We’re thinking about the long-term trend here, and that is explosive growth.”Bloomberg.com"

A massive supply glut brought on by the pandemic and a worldwide shortage of storage space have touched off an relentless rout that has shifted the entire forward curve for oil.The meltdown spreading across global oil markets has already wiped out tens of thousands of jobs and frozen billions of dollars in capital spending. Its deflationary effect threatens to further cripple economies around the world already reeling from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers have become overwhelmed by a vast oversupply brought on by an unprecedented plunge in global fuel demand.Oil is a “dangerous market to trade in right now,” said Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP, in a Bloomberg TV interview. The market needs oil production to fall immediately for prices to recover, he said.The price crash spilled into the ETF market, with the biggest crude-tracking fund, the United States Oil Fund LP, moving some of its WTI contracts into later months, according to a regulatory filing. The June/July WTI spread rallied more than US$1 a barrel on the move.Oil Ministers from the OPEC+ coalition held an unscheduled conference call on Tuesday to discuss the collapse without settling on new policy measures. The Texas Railroad Commission, meanwhile, opted to put off a decision on whether to impose oil-production quotas.In London, the immediate contract for Brent crude was at the biggest discount to the following month in data since 2008. U.S. marker WTI’s June contract was halted three times early in New York to manage the volatility, CME Group Inc. said.“If you start to look at the actual supply-demand situation for oil, it’s not so obvious that by the time those contracts expire, the storage situation around Cushing will be very different than what it is in May,” said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “The prices of these futures will need to connect to the physical reality, and they are likely to crack lower.”WTI for June dropped 43 per cent to US$11.57 a barrel in New York. The thinly traded May contract closed at US$10.01 a barrel.Brent crude futures for June slumped 24 per cent to close at US$19.33 a barrel.The collapse is reverberating across the oil industry, with prices trading below zero across America on Monday. WTI Midland in Texas — a flagship marker for the U.S. shale industry — was at -US$13.13 a barrel, while crude in Alaska was at -$US46.63.There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up. Royal Vopak NV, the world’s biggest independent storage company, said almost all of its space is sold.Crude stockpiles at Cushing — America’s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract — have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. U.S. nationwide inventories are estimated to have increased another 14 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Dated Brent benchmark, a global reference for nearly two thirds of the world’s physical flows, plunged to US$13.24 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since 1999, according to price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. That means that key European and African crude streams, including Urals from Russia and Bonny Light from Nigeria, would sell now under $10 a barrel, as they trade at a discount to the Dated Brent benchmark.Bloomberg.com"

But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.The US$4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker USO) slumped about 11 per cent to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32 per cent to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.USO didn’t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract’s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.“Additional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be ‘lights out’ as a partnership and could actually ‘owe’ money,” writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product’s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund’s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. “However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,” according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.“There has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,” she said. “Unclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we’re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.”In the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called “acceleration events” that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"

It’s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada’s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade’s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market’s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there’s an epic glut. Net asking rents — what the landlord receives — for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That’s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America’s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Boom, Bust, BustFour buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China’s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.“The office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,” said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.

Canada’s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers’ ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time 
 
“There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,” said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar’s director of market analytics for Canada. “Whereas now, it’s been bust for a long time.” His firm sees the city’s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.“It’s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they’re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,” Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn’t survive or deserted their leased space.Unemployment RisingThe crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary’s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil’s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary’s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space.

Landlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said. Already he knows of one landlord that is allowing its tenants to pay only operating costs and taxes while skipping net rent for a while. Another went to its bankers early on in the crisis and worked out a deal to only pay interest costs on its debt for the rest of the year, he said.Over the longer term, to rescue its office market, Calgary will need some larger change in its economic course, whether that’s an influx of technology companies or a rebound in the oil industry caused by a federal commitment to a national pipeline, Throndson said.For CoStar’s Van Dijk, diversifying the economy will be key. Many oil-market analysts are projecting demand will peak in the 10 to 20 years ahead, and Canadian oil, which is typically costlier to produce, process and ship to market, may not fare well in that environment, he said.“The question is, ‘Is this the industry that you want driving the economy?’” Van Dijk said. “Whether it’s 10 years, 20 years, 50 years down the road, eventually that gravy train is going to dry up.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s reduced the output of wood chips that pulp mills rely on to make everything from toilet paper and wipes to cardboard boxes and paper bags, said Derek Nighbor, president and chief executive officer of the Ottawa-based Forest Products Association of Canada.Without federal aid to get some sawmill capacity back on line, input costs could rise or there could be a shortage of the materials pulp mills need for household products, he said. Panic buying has already caused shortages of toilet paper and other hygiene products in supermarkets around the world.

“The demand from pulp mills has gone up at a time when we’re starting to see the chip supply become more scarce from the sawmills,” Nighbor said in a telephone interview. “It could drive the cost up or there could be product constraints for sure in the months ahead.”High production costs in Canada squeezed profits for sawmills. The U.S. housing market remains under pressure as the coronavirus spreads, and lumber futures plunged a record 32 per cent in March.The industry is optimistic that Canada’s government can tweak its wage subsidy program to help forest operators qualify and bolster their access to cash to help them survive the coming quarters, Nighbor said.

USO’s slide came after investors plowed US$1.6 billion into the exchange-traded fund last week — the best on record.USO is a popular choice for retail investors looking to bet on short-term price reversals, buying dips and selling rallies. However, those bets soured Monday. Crude plunged as a deadly pandemic ravaging global economies threatens to erase an entire decade of demand growth, slashing thousands of jobs and wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars from company valuations.

A deal for Caltex Australia would have marked the largest acquisition in the country this year as well as the third-biggest in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The current situation in the world is highly uncertain,” Couche-Tard said in a statement. “The COVID-19 crisis is first and foremost a human tragedy that has impacted millions of people and has also been meaningfully disruptive to economies and businesses around the world, including the Australian fuel and convenience retail industries.”

The Canadian company said it continues to see Caltex Australia as a “strong strategic fit” and plans to re-engage “once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook.” Matthew Halliday, Caltex Australia’s interim chief executive officer, said in an interview that the company has a “reasonably strong” balance sheet and continues to explore an initial public offering or trade sale for its property assets.Shares of Caltex Australia plummeted as much as 9.1 per cent in Sydney on Monday. The stock dropped 7.8 per cent at close, while the country’s benchmark index S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.5 per cent .Couche-Tard’s dropout could shift the focus to bids by other parties including the closely-held EG Group. The U.K.-based company in February offered to pay A$3.9 billion in cash for Caltex’s retail outlets along with shares in a new listed company made up of the remaining fuel refining operations. However, Caltex’s board rejected EG’s bid a month later.Caltex Australia, which has a network of about 2,000 retail fuel sites, hasn’t received any updates since then, Halliday said in the interview on Monday.“It’s fair to say everyone is focused on managing their way through the current situation,” the interim CEO said. “EG remains a very significant customer of ours, so we talk to EG all the time but no meaningful update from a transactional point of view.”Couche-Tard, owner of convenience stores operating under brands including Circle K, first offered to acquire Caltex Australia in October and sweetened its offer a month later to A$34.50 cash per share. Caltex Australia rejected the A$8.6 billion offer but gave the Canadian firm “selected non-public information” for a revised proposal. In February, Couche-Tard boosted its offer for a second time to A$8.8 billion, which is equivalent to A$35.25 apiece in cash.A plunge in oil prices and coronavirus-induced curbs on travel added uncertainty to the business outlook for both Couche-Tard and Caltex Australia. Due diligence for the deal was completed last week, though Halliday said the Canadian convenience-store giant didn’t table a final price.On Monday, Caltex reported an A$29 million net loss for the first quarter, following an earlier announcement that it would extend the maintenance shutdown of its Lytton refinery in Queensland as well as disclosing that its convenience shop sale levels were flat compared to 2019. The company has said it expects jet fuel demand in Australia to drop by as much as 90% as the country’s airlines slash their schedules.Couche-Tard indicated that any deal could be concluded quickly if revived.“We remain convinced of the long-term financial and strategic merits of an acquisition of Caltex and all the benefits it would offer to the shareholders of both companies,” Couche-Tard Chief Executive Officer Brian Hannasch said in the statement. “Our current plan would be to re-engage the process once there is sufficient clarity as to the global outlook, and the work done to date should mean that we will be able to quickly formalize our proposal at that time.”Bloomberg.com"

As its oil sector shrivelled in recent years, Canada’s economy became ever more driven by real estate, an industry now in a state of paralysis. Nearly one in three workers have applied for income support.What’s more, its households are among the world’s most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm.

“I think it is the Great Reckoning,” says Douglas Hoyes, a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener, Ontario. “We’ve been in a period for so long where it didn’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were. Well, guess what? Now it matters.”Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus, policy makers have raced to buttress the property market. Banks are offering mortgage holidays, including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties.That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry. “Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance?” asks Steve Saretsky, a Vancouver realtor. “Where exactly do we draw the line?”A ‘Flammable’ MarketThe country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing. Real estate has become Canada’s largest sector. Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there’s not much that can pick up the slack — certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven’t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer — they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.

That virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It’s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city’s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up — “Don’t use your house like an ATM” — as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted 
 
Today, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 — a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt — an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country’s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.“You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,” says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. “And this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.”Airbnb Customers VanishIt doesn’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That’s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.

Then there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada’s Airbnb hosts — who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 — need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.“It’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter’s grandchildren aren’t even going to be able to pay this off,” says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. “What’s the plan after?”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said the online retail giant is developing COVID-19 testing capabilities as a first step toward a system of regular checks on its employees globally.In an annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire founder outlined other steps the e-commerce giant has taken to curb the coronavirus, from shutting down non-essential services like Amazon Books to overhauling processes at Whole Foods. The next step was regular testing for all staff — including those who showed no symptoms, he said. On Thursday, Bezos said his company had assembled a team comprising scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its first testing lab soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” Bezos said in the letter, which offers a rare window into the thinking of the world’s richest man and his plans for the company he founded. Bezos in recent years has rarely done media interviews or commented publicly on events.

Amazon is working to keep its e-commerce operations running as the coronavirus pandemic sickens employees and disrupts supply chains. Amid criticism that Amazon wasn’t doing enough to protect workers in warehouses and on delivery routes, Bezos in March wrote to employees, thanking them for their work and predicting the outbreak “will get worse before it gets better.” He subsequently donned a mask and toured a company warehouse near Dallas, where he posed for selfies with workers.

Bezos also reiterated previous company announcements that Amazon has distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at facilities around the world. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company was crowding together would-be recruits at job fairs — flouting official guidelines urging people to stay at least six feet apart. In the letter, Bezos said: “We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.”Bezos, as is his custom, included in his note a copy of his 1997 letter to shareholders. It’s a way of reminding his audience that Amazon’s strategy of prioritizing long-term thinking and customer satisfaction over short-term profits has paid off handsomely for investors.Last year, Bezos used his annual letter to advance an argument that Amazon’s growth had benefited third-party merchants that sell on its site. The comments were widely interpreted as a rejoinder to critics who say Amazon has amassed too much market power and should be broken up.Bloomberg.com"

Assuming they pass, they’ll move inside to greet their supervisors behind plexiglass wickets and slather themselves with hand sanitizer.The new safety measures — a sampling from a 20-page list of COVID-19 requirements, according to Chief Executive Officer Sean Boyd — become most challenging as the workers enter the giant elevator for a 45 minute trip that takes them three kilometres underground.“Normally in the cage you’re jammed in there like sardines,” Boyd said in an interview Tuesday. “We’ve reduced the capacity in the cage by more than 50 per cent.

But with 6 million people seeking income support in the face of an unprecedented economic slump, pressure is building among the country’s provinces for a return to work. The effort will likely be messy, with bursts of activity followed by setbacks — and it will be months, if not longer, before the country is running anywhere near capacity.

Quebec, the province with 52 per cent of the country’s cases and 44 per cent of its deaths, took an initial step this week by making mining and home construction priority sectors, enabling their return to business. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has struck a cabinet committee to craft a recovery plan, while British Columbia may reveal more details this week on potential ways to consider relaxing some social-distancing restrictions.“We don’t want to add a housing crisis on top of the current crisis,” Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Monday during a daily press briefing, in explaining why the province has changed its mind about construction.Following ChinaOn both sides of the border, regional governments are keen to control what reopens first and when. In Canada, provinces have control over many economic policies as well as public services from education to health. California and some of America’s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has “total” authority to reopen the world’s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is “coordinating” his country’s response.“We are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,” he said a news conference in Ottawa. “We recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve. We’re going to make sure that we try to stay coordinated as best as possible but those discussions are ongoing about how we’re going to reopen the economy. It’s just that it’s going to be a while still.”Discussions are ongoing about how we're going to reopen the economy. It's just that it's going to be a while stillJustin Trudeau 
 
In Ontario, Linda Hasenfratz, CEO of auto-parts maker Linamar Corp., has had a front row seat to the reopening process. About 95 per cent of the company’s employees at her six factories in China are now available to work. Like the miner Agnico-Eagle, workers face temperature checks and extensive screening to rule out exposure to the virus, along with strict spacing rules and greater sanitation and hygiene at the plants. Most of the company’s 61 factories, which employ 27,000, remain shuttered, Hasenfratz said.“We can’t be locked down forever,” she said in a phone interview. “The virus will still be around us. It won’t be eradicated so it’s really important that we try to create a work environment and protocol to make sure we work safely together.”Any return to work hinges on further progress against the virus. The country had recorded 26,146 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 823 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, and seen a slight decrease in the pace of both in recent days.Cautious StepsDr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s chief medical officer, said Monday the province may consider potential steps to relax restrictions “to get going again in our communities and in our health care sector,” but only after considering an updated model of the outbreak’s trajectory. That model is expected to be released later this week, she said. The province was the first to feel the brunt of the disease and now appears to be pulling out first.“We will do like all countries in the world: a step-by-step, progressive approach,” Quebec Chief Medical Officer Horacio Arruda said.It may also be easier to get factories and construction sites up running again than to entice people back to restaurants or other public spaces.You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don't feel confident to go to it, then you're not going to see your economy come back onlineFrances Donald 
 
“The services side of the business, that’s harder,” Frances Donald, global chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg television. “You can open your coffee shop again, but if people don’t feel confident to go to it, then you’re not going to see your economy come back online.”Agnico-Eagle’s Boyd said the return to work is strictly voluntary. The company has 900 permanent staff at the LaRonde mine.“It will be gradual and if we see things that we’re uncomfortable with, clearly we won’t go forward with it.”Bloomberg.com"

Occidental had been paying cash since Buffett invested US$10 billion last year to help fund the company’s US$37 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., demanding an 8 per cent annual dividend.Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub survived a bitter 10-month campaign by Icahn to seize control of the company by granting him board seats and corporate governance changes. But as the COVID-19 pandemic destroys demand for crude and strips producers of cash, her most immediate challenge is to tackle the debt pile Occidental accrued last year to beat Chevron Corp. in the bidding war for Anadarko.

With US$11 billion of debt due by 2022, Occidental is looking for any and all possible ways to save cash after being downgraded to junk last month. It has slashed employees’ pay, reduced its regular dividend to common shareholders for the first time in 30 years and asked workers to appeal for government financial aid for the oil industry.Occidental’s share registration doesn’t mean Berkshire and its affiliates will necessarily sell any stock, according to the filing Wednesday. It’s unclear whether Berkshire will eventually sell down its common stock stake in the oil producer, has already chipped away at that holding in recent months, or might buy more shares. Berkshire was Occidental’s ninth biggest common shareholder at Dec. 31, with a 2.1 per cent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.While Buffett has been known to keep some of his investments for decades, he’s also been willing to trim stakes at times. Recently, his Omaha, Nebraska-based company sold some shares in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. as the coronavirus ravaged the airline industry.Occidental is the second-worst performing member of the S&P 500 Energy Index since its interest in Anadarko became known a year ago, plunging 79 per cent in that span, while the index fell 51 per cent.Occidental declined 12 per cent at 11:44 a.m. in New York, with West Texas Intermediate crude down 3.1 per cent to US$19.50 a barrel.The Occidental bet was one of Buffett’s largest deals in recent years and mimicked some of the famous financial crisis-era moves that allowed him to get preferred stock in companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The transaction allowed Buffett to deploy a large sum of his cash pile and accrue generous dividends.Buffett has been struggling in recent years to find attractive ways to deploy his cash, which was close to a record US$128 billion at the end of last year. The billionaire investor noted in his annual report that Occidental’s dividends on his preferred stock could be paid in cash or in shares of the oil producer.Berkshire didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment sent to Buffett’s assistant.

The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt.

Canada is at a critical juncture — if we don’t transform our economy then we will face a greater crisis
One thing he’s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada’s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That’s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, “you’d be saying ‘look, we’ve got your back,’” Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province’s debt to buy?Expanding PurchasesThe central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “To do this, they would likely target a ‘zone’ for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,” Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Provide ClarityAustralia’s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the “economic recovery is well underway.” More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"

The news was first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper.

“If Bridging were to press existing borrowers out of the portfolio in order to satisfy unusual redemptions in the funds, the effect would be to cut off funding to these businesses during an unprecedented economic emergency,” the firm said in the letter seen by Bloomberg News. It could also result in investors being treated unfairly “if Bridging were to be asked to sell positions at a discount given the lack of a normal market.”The firm said in the letter that many of its borrowers — which work in everything from milling flour to delivering groceries, repairing Coast Guard vessels and monitoring train tracks — are experiencing higher demand for their products as people need more of the basic services they provide.Last month, Sharpe said the firm had a surge in calls from companies desperate for loans. He said at the time that his team was speeding up work to accommodate some of the requests for urgent loans ranging from $10 million to $50 million, he said.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn’t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported last month.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately $2.6 billion.

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockGita Gopinath, IMF's chief economist 
 
While the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF’s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency. 
Advanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs

In a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.“This crisis is like no other,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. “Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.”As with the virus’s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.“Many countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,” the IMF said. “Risks of a worse outcome predominate.”The grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF’s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that “global growth appears to be bottoming out.” Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund’s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged “more dire scenarios” were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF’s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan’s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF’s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week. Their normal in-person meetings typically draw thousands of delegates, observers and journalists from 189 member countries.

Coronavirus-related market gyrations led Tesla shares to drop as much as a 61 per cent from a record high on Feb. 19. The stock has been steadily advancing since the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter deliveries on April 2 and is back to the levels it was trading at in early March.“There is some clear optimism from the bulls,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote to clients on Monday. China production and demand appear poised for a significant rebound and should be a key growth driver over the coming quarter, he said.Even so, it is now a “virtual impossibility” that Tesla will be able to reach its original annual delivery forecast of at least 500,000 units, according to Ives. Bullish investors are also looking past the shutdown of the company’s vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, which could last at least another month, further complicating the delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, he said.Credit Suisse’s Levy also sees Tesla coming up short of its full-year deliveries guidance and is now estimating the company will hand over about 400,000 electric vehicles to customers this year, down from his previous projection for 550,000.While Levy estimates Tesla is burning about US$300 million of cash every week that its Fremont factory is down, he believes the company will emerge from the crisis with advantages over other automakers.“It likely has a lead in batteries, its liquidity is improved and it has shown signs of improvements in basic auto execution,” Levy said.Bloomberg.com"

‘Brutal education’: Inside the mad rush to make masks to battle COVID-19
Last week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a temporary rule that would require all exports of certain masks, gloves and other materials used in the U.S.’s coronavirus response to get “explicit approval” from FEMA.The rule included a single exemption — for covered materials that are made by or on behalf of U.S. manufacturers with continuous export agreements with customers in other countries. And the exemption only applies if at least 80 per cent of that manufacturer’s domestic production was distributed in the U.S. in the past year.Within hours of publishing that rule, FEMA and CBP representatives were flooded with emails and phone calls asking for clarity.Exemption DefinitionsOn a conference call the agencies held last week, companies and their lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rule: What if a multinational firm ships products to one of its offices overseas because they’re needed for personal protection, but not for sale? One participant noted that their shipment, addressed to a U.S. military base in the Middle East, was halted because it didn’t fit the definition of the exemption under the rule, three people familiar with the call said.“This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masks,” said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “But it shows the danger of regulating trade in vital medical supplies unilaterally by anecdote rather than after careful review and consultations with key trading partners.”This ban apparently happened because the president was shocked to see a story about a U.S. company exporting masksRufus Yerxa 
 
The CBP memo, dated April 9, adds that the focus of the ban is on “commercial quantities,” which it defines as shipments valued at US$2,500 and containing more than 10,000 units of gloves, masks and other covered materials.A CBP spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.While the internal guidance is seen as a way to help administer the export ban, the document has not been made public, leaving exporters in the dark on any modification that may have been made to the rule.The rule reserved the right for the FEMA Administrator to establish additional exemptions “that he determines are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defence and will announce any such exemptions by notice in the Federal Register.”Such a notice has yet to be published.Bloomberg.com"

That prompted the bank’s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn’t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a “bad recession” and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.“Given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,” Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. “The first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do – outside of our ordinary course of business – to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.”Some of the damage was offset by gains in the bank’s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income — revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors — by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company’s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank’s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It’s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.“The company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid – with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,” Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"

Still, it’s a sign that Amazon is able to accommodate a larger assortment of goods after hiring 100,000 workers and announcing plans to hire 75,000 more. Further details about specific products being accepted and quantities will be shared with Amazon’s merchant partners in the coming days.“Later this week, we will allow more products into our fulfillment centres,” Amazon said in an emailed statement. “Products will be limited by quantity to enable us to continue prioritizing products and protecting employees, while also ensuring most selling partners can ship goods into our facilities.”

The move was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.In prioritizing toilet paper, bleach and sanitizing wipes over things like flat-screen televisions and toys, the company focused on delivering products people need right now, sacrificing sales from its deep inventory for the time being.More than half of all products sold on Amazon come from independent merchants who pay Amazon commissions on each sale plus fees for storing, packing and delivering products. Merchants selling in-demand products saw a nice sales bump from swift changes in customer demand while those in the out-of-favour categories watched their sales tank.While Amazon wasn’t accepting new shipments of goods it deemed non-essential, workers in warehouses around the country said they continued to shelve and ship non-essential items like kickballs, bedsheets and books as well as restock returned items. That generated tension because some workers said they felt Amazon could further restrict the products it sold to better protect warehouse workers. Dozens of employees have contracted the coronavirus, and protests have erupted in New York, Chicago and outside Detroit.Groceries and household essentials as well as bread machines, home fitness equipment and computer monitors were among Amazon’s fastest-growing products in March, according to the online retail research firm Stackline.

The dollar’s surge has been particularly painful for countries that ran up borrowing in greenbacks and which will now struggle to cover the loans, especially as their exports tumble.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will convene by conference call on Wednesday. They are planning to offer lower income countries a freeze on bilateral government loan repayments for six or nine months or possibly into 2021, the Financial Times reported, citing an official.That fits a plan championed by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass. The World Bank in March estimated that US$14 billion in service payments are due this year.The fear is that if the emerging markets lag behind, “it means more of a U-shaped or an L-shaped kind of recovery for the U.S. and global economies,” said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury official who’s now chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.While the U.S., Europe and Japan have opened up the monetary and budgetary spigots to fight Covid-19 and its economic after-effects, many emerging economies lack the scope to do so.Morgan Stanley economists predict that emerging markets, excluding China, will shrink 4.1 per cent in the current quarter, a deeper dive than the 3.1 per cent of the first quarter of 2009 when the world was last in crisis, though shallower than what’s expected in richer economies. They also estimated in an April 3 report that the peak rate of growth during the recovery for those economies will be 6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus 7.7 per cent in the same period of 2010.The problem is even more acute in the poorest nations, where many denizens can’t easily practice the social distancing and regular hand washing that has become de-rigueur in rich countries.Such an environment leaves the IMF reckoning that emerging market and developing countries will need trillions of dollars in external financing to fight the virus, only part of which they can cover on their own, leaving gaps of hundreds of billions of dollars. Half of the international lending organization’s 189 members are already looking to it for aid.Georgieva is trying to rally the world into a unified display of support at the Fund’s semi-annual meeting, which starts Tuesday as a virtual gathering after the typical spring gathering in Washington was re-imagined.“Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other,” Georgieva said in an April 9 speech. “The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery.”There are questions, though, about whether the Fund has enough to counter the crisis, especially if it proves protracted.While the IMF says it has a US$1 trillion war chest, Ted Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the maximum amount available for new lending is US$787 billion, after taking into account existing commitments and other factors. “The IMF will need more” from the U.S. and the rest of the G20, he said.And it’s not just the amount of resources that are at issue. It’s what kind they are.The crisis has exposed a gaping hole at the center of the global economy. There’s no ultimate lender of last resort who can provide the liquidity that’s demanded in a financial emergency.Funds PulledSome $62 billion was yanked out of emerging markets in the first quarter in a global dash for cash by investors, twice the size of outflows at the peak of the world financial crisis, according to the Institute of International Finance.While there are signs that pressure is easing — Indonesia, for example, sold $4.3 billion of dollar bonds last week to help finance virus relief measures — there are risks the outflows could resume as the hit to emerging market growth becomes more evident, IIF analysts said.The Federal Reserve has moved to partly fill the void, including opening up dollar liquidity swap lines with Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Sheets said it should do the same with India, Indonesia and Chile.The IMF also has to step up and be willing to set its aside its traditional playbook for dealing with countries in trouble, in which it demands economic reforms in return for financial assistance.“This is much more of an exogenous shock,” said former U.S. Treasury official Mark Sobel, now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank focused on economic policy and central banking. “There needs to be some recalibration by the IMF to provide far more liberal and fast liquidity to members.”The fund seems to be trying to do just that.It’s looking at the use of precautionary short-term loans to get cash to countries, as well as other funding options like the increased use of reserve assets called special drawing rights, steps that would require the approval of rich nations.One problem with the IMF stepping up, said ex-IMF official Taimur Baig: Many countries don’t like turning to the organization because they fear being tarred as a nation in trouble.Repayment Pause“Drawing on to IMF resources has an element of stigma and it is still seen as the last resort of a crisis-hit nation,” said Baig, who’s now chief economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.For some emerging economies with balance of payment challenges, the “more expedient” currency-stabilizing measure is to draw on swap lines or repurchase agreements, as Indonesia has done, said Baig, questioning why the IMF doesn’t also offer those facilities.In the 2008-09 crisis, the G-20 banded together to come up with an action plan.That’s been more difficult this time for a group riven by rivalries — the U.S. and China over trade, Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil, and the U.K. and the European Union over Brexit.IIF President Tim Adams said the G-20 must rise to the occasion, nonetheless.“There will be enormous attention and enormous expectations” focused on this week’s gatherings, he said. “Not meeting them could be detrimental for markets and for confidence.”Bloomberg.com"

At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who’ve seen prototypes.

Apple iPhone sales grow again, pushing profits above expectations
Because of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn’t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it’s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year’s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.This year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple’s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple’s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod’s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.Bloomberg.com"

And now I would like to ask you: ‘Do you agree with these terms?’”In Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. “I go with the consensus. I agree,” he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico’s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless.

“We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,” he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. “I’m more than happy.”For the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world’s major oil producers to rein in output.We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and aliveSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman 
 
But the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world’s biggest economies.“The OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,” said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.Negative ReactionThe deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market — 20 per cent of global production.Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19…..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020For the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world’s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don’t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7 per cent to US$30.63 a barrel.Deal MakerThe biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation’s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world’s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He’s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise.

“Trump views himself as a deal maker,” said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So “Trump went to the oil market’s red phone.”The president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbour’s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn’t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Price WarSunday’s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia’s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group’s existing curbs at their current level.

Angered by Russia’s refusal to cut and Novak’s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25 per cent from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it’s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30 per cent in seconds — the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.Month of ChaosWhat followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market’s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time 
 
Brent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above US$70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to US$21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world’s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs.

The next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day — enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.‘Wiped Out’It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world’s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.“I never thought I’d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,” Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be “wiped out.”Saudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.”Of

But Russia.’ And I said, ‘But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You’re supposed to be our friend. And so don’t screw with us.”By then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.“We see a huge oversupply in the oil market,” said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump TweetTrump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn’t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2020Brent crude jumped more than 45 per cent in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21 per cent — the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia’s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America’s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal’s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world’s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren’t in its interest.“Trump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,” said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. “Of all the deals he’s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.”Bloomberg.com"

As OPEC's tentative deal falls short, Canadian producers fear 1.7 million barrels a day will be shut in
OPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day — just below the initial plan of 10 million. Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels — less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were “horrifying.”West Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn’t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico’s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20. The group, however, didn’t mention any curbs in its communique following a meeting on Friday, only saying it would take measures to ensure stability.Bloomberg.com"

Cannabis bankruptcies start to roll in as pandemic halts financing
Global stock meltdown is a disaster for cannabis industry already on the brink
The long-term investment thesis for the industry hasn’t changed as legalization spreads and demand grows, but first companies need to survive long enough to see it, said MJBiz Daily analyst Mike Regan.Many cannabis companies were running low on cash and struggling to raise more before the pandemic, which only made the situation more difficult as equity markets tumbled and volatility spiked. The total amount of capital raised by the industry fell 69 per cent in March from a month earlier as funding sources dried up, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.This has weighed on stock prices. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index fell more than 50 per cent between mid-February and its recent low on March 18, and had already lost two-thirds of its value in the 12 months before that.Based on an analysis of 1,400 consumer stocks during the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, Regan said pot stocks are likely to fall even further. In those two bear markets, valuations typically compressed 30 per cent to 50 per cent, falling to 2.4x sales or 7.5x EBITDA. While pot stocks have lost more than 50 per cent on average, many are still trading above those multiples. This is particularly true in Canada, where the average enterprise valuations are 5x sales and 11.3x EBITDA.Those that do survive will rebound sharply, but the trick will be picking the winners, he said.“Even if the long-term cannabis investment thesis is intact, it’s going to come down to executing on that idea to actually realize that return,” Regan said.Bloomberg.com"

Importantly, Russia has agreed to make deep cuts, the delegates said.Oil prices pared gains, trading up 1.6 per cent in London at US$33.37 a barrel as of 4:13 p.m. local time.

An agreement from OPEC+ and a broader alliance — including America — is crucial to reviving prices that have sunk to an 18-year low. Not only oil companies, but entire oil-dependent economies need the market to rebound if they’re to balance ailing budgets.Friday’s Group of 20 talks will provide the forum for U.S. President Donald Trump to respond to OPEC+’s agreement.

Compared to other groups at the same point in their lives, people in their 20s and 30s have relatively low levels of home ownership, net worth and real income, according to a 2018 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper.“They’re walking a tight rope and there are cliffs on either side,” said Kathryn Edwards, a labor economist at the Rand Corporation. “It’s hard to imagine someone making it through both of these recessions in this age group really unscathed.”Economic downturns are inevitable, but they’re not usually so severe. And once-in-a-generation recessions don’t tend to occur just a decade apart.For millennials, the timing of these events has been particularly damaging. People who enter a labour market with high unemployment typically see a 10 per cent hit to income in the first year, with the effect averaging out to a 1.8 per cent reduction in yearly earnings over 10 years, according economists at Yale and the University of Rochester. They also found the impact of the Great Recession on wages to have been “much larger” than previous downturns.

Because an economic crisis hampers job mobility, the effects of one early on in a person’s professional life can last for the next 20 years, research from Carnegie Mellon economics professor Shu Lin Wee has found.This phenomenon isn’t confined to the U.S. In Britain, between 2006 and 2014 real earnings fell twice as fast for people under 30 than for those in their 50s, according to the Resolution Foundation.Meanwhile in Italy, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in Europe, just 24 per cent of houses and land are owned by the young, while the risk of poverty is twice as high among those under the age of 40 than those over 65, according to a study by business association Confindustria.Other generations will experience their own flavour of economic fallout from coronavirus. The oldest members of Generation Z are graduating into a world of city-wide lockdowns, as countries try to curb the spread of a global pandemic.Baby Boomers in the U.S. have now suffered successive blows to their retirement portfolios because of market routs. Those are the lucky ones: Almost half of U.S. households 55 and older have nothing saved for retirement. Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.“I worry about the younger guys more,” said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. They’re more likely to get laid off than those more senior, he said, adding, “I worry even more about the people without college diplomas.”

While white collar workers can work from home, sectors largely filled by people without college degrees, such as retail, food services, hospitality and construction have already seen major job losses because of the pandemic.One such person is Denzel Buie, a 25-year-old glazier living in Philadelphia with his fiance and his three-year-old daughter. He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won’t be able to afford a hospital visit.“It makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,” he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won’t retire on schedule.“You’re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,” he said. Millennials “will have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.”Already millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.“It could be a problem if the unemployment stops,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Private-sector forecasters now expect a historic contraction in second quarter U.S. output, followed by a rebound in the second half of the year.In an evening teleconference following the March 15 announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that he expected the virus to run its course and the U.S. economy to resume a normal level of activity. But he said “in the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible.”Since then, the U.S. central bank has begun rolling out a number of emergency lending programs first deployed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Those include measures to fund short-term borrowings of companies in the commercial paper market and clean up the balance sheets of dealer banks and money-market mutual funds by accepting a wide range of securities as collateral in exchange for cash loans.The Fed has also since announced new lending programs which would see them extend support to large companies through purchases of longer-term corporate debt, as well as facilities that will offer lifelines to small and medium-sized businesses.

Toronto-Dominion is able to shift about 350 employees in Canada and 150 in the U.S. each day, and by the end of April almost all of its 9,500 call centre staff will be working from home, aside from those with less than three months experience.“The whole business working together really made this happen: the logistics, the risk component, the technology, the deployment,” Toronto-Dominion’s Smith said. “We have people working every single night, all night long, every day of the week to make this happen.”The effort hasn’t been without its challenges, including deploying all the laptops and monitors — nor risks.Flexibility Embraced“We know that it is a little bit different working from home — we can’t control everything that you can control in the office, so we had to become comfortable with the way we mitigate our risk,” Smith said. “That was a big obstacle that we overcame.”Working from home has been embraced by the employees, according to Smith. Workers get an extra 10 personal days to help with daycare issues and the ability to change schedules and do split shifts.When the COVID-19 pandemic ends, Toronto-Dominion expects to keep work-from-home as an option for call centre staff.“There’s no telling what this is going to look like when we’re all done and how people are going to feel, but I would like to continue to allow agents to work from home even after the crisis,” Smith said. “And that would be solely for flexibility.”Bloomberg.com"

He also said measures to deal with the crises may cause Alberta’s budget deficit this year to almost triple to $20 billion.“I cannot overstate how grave the implications of this will be for jobs, the economy, and the financial security of Albertans,” Kenney said.

Kenney also said that the province won’t be able to start relaxing social-distancing measures to slow the spread of the virus until the end of May. Once the province does start to relax those measures, it will mimic other jurisdictions like Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea that have managed to both contain the virus while keeping their economies functioning, he said.That will include aggressive mass testing to identify positive cases and those with immunity, precise targeting of close contacts, border screening, strict enforcement of quarantine orders and encouraging the use of masks in crowded public spaces, he said.Kenney also released projections for the numbers of potential infections and deaths from the Covid-19 virus in the province under different scenarios:Under the “probable” scenario, Alberta may see as many as 800,000 infections and 400 to 3,100 deathsUnder the less likely “elevated” scenario, the province may see as many as 1 million infections and 500 to 6,600 deaths. If the province implemented no social-distancing measures, it could have experienced as many as 1.6 million infections and 32,000 deaths.“These models are not a done deal,” Kenney said. “I want Albertans to see them as a challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation.”Bloomberg.com"

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame after his hedge fund’s bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in “The Big Short,” an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis.

Bear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis
Although Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled “bubble” in passive investment products. He’s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.“Universal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,” Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. “And it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.”Burry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community, began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle as the “real personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.” He said he began speaking out because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. “Unconscionable,” is how he described job losses in the U.S., which have caused a once-unthinkable 10 million people to apply for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He’s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn’t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. “We feel a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,” he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a “significant bearish market bet that is working out for now,” without providing details except to say it was a trade of a “good size” against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he has also highlighted large economies that haven’t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain. Germany and Japan have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19— michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here’s what he had to say about China’s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened“This is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.”“In hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.”The U.S. Policy Response“If there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.”Potential Treatments“It’s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don’t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors’ hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.”“A more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups — the obese, old and already-sick — to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.”Getting Back to Normal“I would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.”“When it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we’re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments — both new and repurposed — shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.”“Medically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.”Japan’s Response“I believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features — such as a largely lawful and well-educated society — that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.”Business Recovery“Economically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.”“Countries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.”Bloomberg.com"

Then one of the bank’s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: “The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr’s note.”The trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's note 
 
More than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan’s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they’re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home.

“We’ve stated many times that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to,” said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. “We have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor’s note.”Those tensions aren’t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It’s the finance industry’s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where “essential” workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Trading DelugeSome investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it’s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank’s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn’t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it’s trying to be respectful of people’s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.

Traders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn’t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked “important” last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. “We remain open,” the memo said. “Driving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.” Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown — even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Skeleton CrewsMost big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm’s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor’s note to work from home.

Inside Natixis SA’s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: “Highly Confidential: COVID-19 — Staff Infection List.”Workers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.“Natixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,” said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. “We have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees’ health and help slow the propagation of the virus.”‘Push Everyone’Market swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it’s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York’s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan’s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank’s global head of markets, “continues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,” Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna’s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn’t have been possible if they’d been working from home.“With the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,” Adragna wrote. “Let’s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET’S GO.”

JPMorgan’s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn’t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders’ dealings. It isn’t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven’t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems “reasonably designed” to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she’s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she’ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"

Bears are fretting the continued spread of the disease, dismal economic data and the rising corporate costs of the pandemic and subsequent shutdown.“For now the markets will likely remain hostage to news on how long it will take to ‘get back to business’ and ‘the good life.”’ John Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote to clients. “We’d expect markets to continue trading on a combination of fear, technical factors and wistful hope with fundamentals clouded by the uncertainty weaved by the insidious virus.”In Asia, Japan’s benchmark ended almost 4 per cent higher even as that country moved closer to declaring a state of emergency. The yen dropped as haven demand receded. Shares in Hong Kong rose while Shanghai was closed for a holiday.Elsewhere, crude oil fell on signals that a glut is growing at America’s key oil storage hub, offsetting earlier support from signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia are making progress toward a supply-curb agreement.Bloomberg.com"

As of last week’s close, the stake was worth $369.4 million.The Saudis are getting a bargain-bin price for Carnival — it’s down 81 per cent this year — as the cruise industry faces unprecedented risks. The Public Investment Fund has invested abroad previously, including stakes in Uber Technologies Inc., Tesla Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. But it isn’t generally known for making distressed investments.Now, it owns a slice of the dominant cruise operator, with a fleet of more than 100 ships and no customers to sail on them — at least for now.Carnival’s operations came to an almost complete stop last month after a series of coronavirus outbreaks at sea. Carnival’s Diamond Princess had more than 700 coronavirus cases, the biggest outbreak outside of mainland China for a time.Rival operators Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. have also shut down.The cruise industry was left out of the US$2.2 trillion U.S. stimulus bill, which excluded non-U.S. businesses. Although it is headquartered in Miami, Carnival is technically incorporated in Panama — an arrangement that allows it to avoid U.S. income taxes and minimum-wage requirements.Competitors are also domiciled outside the U.S.Raising FundsSince the halt of operations, Carnival has raised US$6.25 billion to help meet expenses, but it’s paying a steep price. Some US$4 billion in bonds were priced with an 11.5 per cent coupon last week. The shares were acquired before a planned stock offering by Carnival, so the percentage holding will change.In an interview Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said Carnival may turn to major shipbuilding nations such as Italy or Germany for lower-cost loans.“Yes, those are definitely potential sources,” he said. “And there are others.”Bloomberg.com"

Pot companies completed two capital raises worth just US$5.6 million the week ended March 27, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors. That’s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn’t able to recover from.

“The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,” the company said in a statement, “making it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.”There are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company’s weak revenue in the quarter — just US$7.3 million — prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges. Revised debt covenants require it to raise $40 million in equity by April 30, a “startling sum” that “could mean severe downward pressure” on the stock, according to CIBC analyst John Zamparo. If it can’t secure that financing, that “would put its going concern status at risk,” said BMO’s Tamy Chen.Although cannabis sales jumped as self-isolation orders took effect last month, providing a rare respite for the struggling industry, there are already signs the initial spike is starting to wane.After a notable increase in mid-March, “sales velocity meaningfully decelerated” on the Ontario Cannabis Store website last weekend, “suggesting that this recent surge may be transitory unless COVID-19 quarantine measures are meaningfully extended,” Chen said in a note. “We believe the COVID-19 fallout presents incremental downside for industry sales over the balance of this year.”Bloomberg.com"

But while forecasts range wildly, almost everyone agrees Thursday’s jobs report will show an historic decline.Royal Bank of Canada sees 1 million lost jobs last month and Citigroup Inc. predicts 1.1 million after the coronavirus forced companies nationwide to cut staff. At the other end of the spectrum, 4CAST projects a net loss of 100,000, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. puts it at 175,000.Such disparity may reflect just how quickly the virus has overwhelmed Canada’s economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has rolled out massive fiscal support to encourage employers to keep workers on payrolls, but it’s unclear how effective those programs will be.Prior to the pandemic, the biggest decline in Canadian employment was 125,000 in January 2009.Last month’s potentially epic loss was foreshadowed by jobless claims that have already reached records, with more than 2 million Canadians applying for employment insurance in the second half of March.Statistics Canada conducted its labor force survey between March 15 and March 21, meaning the results should capture the early days of the disruption.The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey of 19 economists is for a drop of 500,000 jobs.

That would leave it approaching the level of $1.4668 it touched last month — its weakest since early 2016 — amid the market turmoil fuelled by the pandemic.“When you look at the Canadian dollar right now, it’s primarily a story of oil price pressures,” Rai said. “We still don’t know how bad the impact is going to be in the real economy.

Canada’s energy sector has been collateral damage in the Saudi-Russia oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Storage tanks worldwide are brimming with crude as the global pandemic destroys demand, while Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a fight for market share.At one point last week, a benchmark of Canadian heavy crude tumbled as low as US$3.82 a barrel. The price of Western Canadian Select for May was US$16.25 below West Texas Intermediate Thursday, according to NE2 Group.And while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has opened the government’s coffers to businesses in an effort to save the Canadian economy, nothing specific has been done for the energy sector yet. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week that further relief measures, specifically for the oil and gas and airline sectors, will come in the “not too distant future.”The twin shock has taken its toll on all energy producers, big and small.Canadian oil giant Suncor Energy Inc. said last week it will shut in one of its two production lines at its two-year-old, 194,000 barrel-a-day Fort Hills oil sands mine. Additionally, demand losses could see commercial inventory levels to be breached within two to three weeks if Canadian production isn’t further reduced, Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this week.RBC’s Pardy said Canadian oil producers will need to shut in or curtail about 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, or one-quarter to one-third of supply, in the second and third quarters of this year.“We have fielded a number of queries regarding the potential role that policymakers in Canada could play in providing energy sector support,” he said. “We believe that Shut & Swap — a conceptual arrangement aimed at revenue smoothing — could be a partial remedy.”Bloomberg.com"

But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don’t apply.From the shale patch of Texas and the oilsands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won’t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, “there could soon be no place for their oil to go.”Every imaginable space — from tanks and pipelines to rail cars — is filling to the brim. It’s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that’s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing.

“It’s important to think about who’s going to shut in. It’s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,” Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview. “It’s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.”Staggering DestructionThe rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it’ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts — in itself a mammoth undertaking —the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America’s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation’s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is “homeless,” with “literally nowhere to go,” consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.Production is starting to buckle everywhere.IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oilsands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.Brazil’s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador, Citigroup Inc. said, “isn’t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.”Producers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most “immune,” Goldman’s Currie said. Those “sitting behind thousands of miles of pipe” are the most exposed.Russia VulnerableRussia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.Neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face “severe offtake issues,” said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.While logistics are critical, oil’s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At US$25 a barrel crude, about 5 per cent of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.Companies are also slashing spending. BP Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about US$5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren’t economical at current oil prices.“In the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,” said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc.Emerging WinnerAmid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than US$10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world — from Egypt to Japan.Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil’s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country’s free-market ethics.But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.“The market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,” said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “That horse has left the barn.”Bloomberg.com"

Real estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada’s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it’s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it’s all but shut down in Quebec.‘No Buyers Are Out’It’s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven’t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.“We’re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it’s ridiculous,” he says. “Why would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.”Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a “tough but temporary blow” to Canada’s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt 
 
How quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.“The longer this goes, the more it’s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,” said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. “So it’ll affect qualifications.”The uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.“People aren’t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,” Collu said in a phone interview. “Purchase activity is going to be curtailed.”Rebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.“We see the outlook improving markedly next year,” RBC’s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. “Exceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.”Papailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and “you can go outside without getting your children or parents sick — I think the market is going to go bananas.”Elton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there’s a broader recession — and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.“There’s the big unknown — the elephant south of the border,” said Ash.Bloomberg.com"

He also tweeted that the cut could be up to 15 million barrels.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2020At noon, Brent futures were up 19 per cent, to US$29.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose US$4.59, or 23 per cent, to $22.55. Canadian WCS surged $3.80 to $9.09. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t spoken to the Saudi crown price and hasn’t agreed to cut oil production to boost prices, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a text message.The Middle East kingdom also didn’t confirm the cuts, but called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC+ producer alliance to reach a “fair deal” that would restore balance in oil markets, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Any curbs by the group would be conditional on other countries joining, according to a delegate.

“The 10, 15 million barrel a day cut is just not going to happen. On top of that, Russia has older oil wells, so they can’t restart in the same way that Saudi Arabia can,” said Tariq Zahir, a fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.He added that there is a chance that the countries might agree to some sort of curb, but if there was a supply reduction of that size, it would come from inventories filling up storage, leading to economic shuts in. The move comes after oil was already climbing following China’s instruction to government agencies to start buying cheap crude for its strategic reserves.Despite the U.S. president’s optimism, Saudi Arabia hasn’t appeared to relent on its bid to flood the market yet, saying on Wednesday it was pumping at a record and had this week loaded almost 19 million barrels of oil in a single day. Meanwhile, Russia has said it’s not satisfied with the oil price.If collective action does remove 10 million barrels a day from the market, that would be the equivalent of about 10 per cent of world demand prior to the impact of coronavirus crisis.That may not be enough to stop the pain that’s rippled across the energy industry as demand craters with the coronavirus outbreak shutting down economies around the world, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura. The trading house raised its consumption-loss estimate to around 35 million barrels a day.“We have no hope of production cuts matching the demand destruction,” he told Bloomberg, adding that by the middle to late April, “oil will have come out of the ground and will struggle to find a home.”That view is consistent with a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note earlier this week, citing that any conceivable oil production cut by the U.S., OPEC+ and Canada would still “fall well short” of its estimated 26 million barrels a day of demand loss and only provide “fleeting support to inland crude prices.”Meanwhile, the physical crude market continues to show deepening signs of strain.Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world’s physical supply, was assessed at $15.135 on Wednesday, the lowest since at least 1999. Crude has slipped below $10 in some areas including Canada and shale regions in the U.S., Belarus wants to buy Russian oil for $4, while some grades have posted negative prices.As supply balloons, there are growing signs that the world is running out of places to store the glut.Bloomberg.com"

As many as 70 per cent of the nation’s 6,000 oil explorers eventually may go under, according to Mizuho Securites USA LLC analyst Paul Sankey, as the twin blows of Covid-19 and a Russia-Saudi price war destroy producers like Whiting.

Once the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region, Whiting lost money in four of the last five years and spiralled deeper into debt just as the COVID-19 outbreak crushed energy demand. The company’s Bakken primacy won it little praise because the region was already falling out of favour as drillers shifted to lower-cost prospects in the Permian Basin.Touted as one of the “comeback kids” of U.S. shale by Canaccord Genuity in late 2015, Whiting said Wednesday that it’s agreed to hand most of its ownership to noteholders in exchange for erasing more than US$2.2 billion in debt, according to a statement.US$262 Million MaturityAs many as 40 per cent of U.S. oil and gas companies could crater into bankruptcy or distress over the next two years as they grapple with a market crash and the coronavirus outbreak, according to asset manager Pickering Energy Partners LP.Shale drillers aren’t the sole sub sector clobbered by the crash. Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc., which specializes in hauling gear to offshore drilling sites and production platforms, disclosed Wednesday that it’s negotiating a plan with creditors to ease a US$1.2 billion debt burden. The company is planning a Chapter 11 filing.On Wednesday, Denver-based Whiting faced the maturity of US$262 million in convertible-notes . Whiting filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the Southern District of Texas, listing debt of US$3.6 billion and assets worth US$7.6 billion in its bankruptcy petition.Even before the viral pandemic sent crude prices tumbling to the lowest in almost two decades, Whiting was struggling and never fully recovered from the last market crash of 2014-2016. In December 2015, as crude prices were just weeks from dipping to a 13-year low, Canaccord analyst Stephen Berman listed Whiting among a group of potential “comeback kids” in the U.S. shale industry.US$20 OilWhen former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executive Brad Holly took the reins as Whiting’s chief in late 2017, oil prices were rising and at one point breached US$75 a barrel. But the debt load remained stubbornly high, prompting Holly last year to fire one-third of his workforce and scale back production targets after posting an unexpected quarterly loss.Oil now trades around US$20 a barrel, well below the US$50 level that Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum estimates Whiting requires to stay afloat. The company, which had a market capitalization of US$11 billion in 2014, was valued at about US$62 million as of Tuesday. Whiting’s bankruptcy filing followed that of shale drillers Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Sanchez Energy Corp., which sought protection last year.Moelis & Co. is Whiting’s financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser and Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser.The case is Whiting Petroleum Corporation, 20-32021, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District.Bloomberg.com"

Investors are grappling with the reality that the world’s biggest economy will stay crippled for longer after Trump heeded advice from the government’s top doctors that re-opening the U.S. in two weeks risks greater loss of life. The president said that social distancing guidelines would remain until at least April 30. But traders also continue to try to plumb the bottom and look for bright spots, such as in health-care companies that could produce products that help curb the outbreak.

"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Doug Alexander,Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts,Canada’s mortgage rates are creeping up — even though the country’s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.,https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada,,"March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT","Canada’s mortgage rates are creeping up — even though the country’s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That’s due to the “enormous pressure” Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.“The costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,” Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. “Every single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.”The Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent. The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada’s large domestic lenders were also offering “prime minus” deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Funding CostsTypical five-year fixed rates at also rising. Rates at large Canadian bank are now at 2.99 per cent to 3.04 per cent versus around 2.49 per cent to 2.59 per cent at the end of February, McLister said.“The big banks are leading the charge higher here, on both the fixed side and the variable side,” he said. Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they’re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.“The banks just can’t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,” Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.“I believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,” Cooper said. “I don’t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.”Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the automaker might be able to help make much-needed ventilators, the scarce breathing machines used to keep coronavirus patients alive.The deal would help the company, which has had tense relations with Trump. It would help the administration, which faced charges that the pandemic caught it napping. Most importantly, it would help the sickest patients, those facing death without machines to breathe for them.But not 10 days later, Trump accused GM of foot-dragging and price-gouging in its effort to replenish the supply of medical equipment. “Always a mess with Mary B,” Trump tweeted, hours before invoking the Defense Production Act, which allowed him to order GM to move.As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2020Newly revealed details show that GM has been continuously engaged in the effort — order or no order — and company officials say the sprint from first phone call to production will take about a month. A parallel effort by Ford Motor Co. isn’t expected to bear fruit until June, though the company has said it’s speeding up its work. Trump did an about-face Sunday, saying GM is doing a “fantastic job.”Even as Trump was excoriating GM on Friday, the automaker and its Seattle-area partner, Ventec Life Systems Inc., were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN: ventilator, oxygen, cough, suction and nebulizer. When they start in mid-April, it will culminate a lightning-fast effort to convert an auto-parts plant into a medical-equipment complex.

“The speed has been challenging,” Gerald Johnson, GM’s global vice president of manufacturing, said in a Sunday evening interview. “But we know it will save thousands of lives. Making cars is cool, but it doesn’t compare to what we’re doing.”Trump’s criticism of GM boiled down to the company asking the federal government to “show me the the money” before it would put the venture into high gear, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. In initial discussions with the administration, GM and its partner were seeking about US$250 million for Ventec and its components suppliers to get production moving. The government wanted to contribute a fraction of that, people familiar with the deliberations said.“You can’t get to the finish line unless you first go to the starting gate,” Navarro, who was appointed last week to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, said in an email to Bloomberg News.Stop the SpreadThe sprint started with exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called Stop the Spread. It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to COVID-19. The group is led by retired American Express Co. Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson, founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc.Making cars is cool, but it doesn't compare to what we're doingGerald Johnson 
 
They asked Barra’s team what they needed to make ventilators. GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force.For his part, Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise, factories and a workforce to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals.Exponential GrowthManagers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help Ventec go from building a maximum of 250 ventilators a month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year. The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year. It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic’s early weeks.“They produce millions of cars a year in the U.S.,” Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks said of GM. “We produce hundreds of ventilators a month. They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale.”The next day, Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in. Kudlow, one of the administration’s primary pitchmen, floated the idea on television. He cited GM as an example of a company that was stepping up “on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.”

But GM was still studying how to make it happen. On March 19, Phil Kinley, vice president of manufacturing and labour and the plant-floor leader of the project, flew with engineers to Ventec’s site in Washington, Johnson said. Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator’s 700 parts to GM’s Tech Center in Warren, north of Detroit.GM’s purchasing team went to work, Johnson said. They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows to wipers. They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses. By March 22, GM had most parts lined up.“The supply base really stepped up,” Johnson said.Painstaking AssemblyThe VOCSN, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017, is primarily used for critical-care ventilation. It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient, and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs, secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep the patient’s chest clear.The company boasts on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment. To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven, a GM assembly plant was ill suited. The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of a Buick. Making a ventilator is more like building a watch: Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs.That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines.

The facility has 300 on staff and will need 1,000 to achieve the production levels GM and Ventec want to reach. The carmaker has started evaluating new hires and is seeking volunteers among the staff idled by the shutdown of parts production in Kokomo and metal stamping in nearby Marion, Indiana.GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process, Johnson said.“This is truly a major step at a critical moment,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime watcher of Detroit’s automakers. “GM was written off and appears to be coming through.”Money MattersGM and Ventec now need to decide how the units will be distributed and paid for. Negotiations continue with the government, which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to people familiar with the matter.That assumes a deal gets done. To the surprise of GM and Ventec, Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing. He tweeted that GM officials “want top dollar.”GM said it’s building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec, which is the major player in negotiations with the government. The machines normally cost about US$18,000 apiece, while some ventilators can run as high as US$50,000.Another benefit of Ventec’s VOCSN is it replaces four other pieces of hardware typically needed for acute respiratory care. Using it could lower costs for hospitals because they won’t need to buy oxygenators, nebulizers and devices to clear the lungs.When Trump complained last week about pricing, people in the GM-Ventec venture thought that the device’s five-in-one therapy capabilities may not have been completely understood. People familiar with negotiations said there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline, and they were caught off guard when the president complained.As negotiations go on, GM and Ventec say they are progressing fast. “The responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need,” Brooks said.There’s already been a change in sentiment from Trump. At his press briefing on Sunday, he said, “I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now.”Bloomberg.com"

Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta. It employs about 300 workers from the community, and its $140 million in annual revenue provides its largest independent source of funds.“It feels like I’m doing a disservice to my family,” Poscente said. “It’s materially devastating to the community, and it feels personal.”Still, Poscente, 57, said the company has grown with an “ultra-conservative” balance sheet since he took over as CEO in 2015 and expects it to withstand the economic troubles better than most competitors.Toronto: Air Attendant GroundedFlight attendant Max Audet got notice a week ago he’d be laid off from Air Canada Rouge on April 3.“The main thing on my mind is that I don’t know how long it’s going to be for,” said Audet, 28, who is also a rep for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents flight attendants. “It really adds to the stress.”

He takes comfort from the fact that with five years under his belt, he’s still senior to 62 per cent of Air Canada staff, thanks to a big hiring spree at the airline in recent years.“I’m definitely worried about the lasting impact it will have on airlines,” he said. “Will we see people doing less travel, which could definitely affect staffing levels over time?”Toronto: Scared for the HomelessOutside the Church of the Redeemer on Toronto’s Mink Mile, one of Canada’s ritziest shopping districts, the drop-in lunch program had plenty of customers.On a normal day, The Common Table provides about 80 lunches to the city’s must vulnerable residents, but with similar programs closing, the number has spiked.

Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months, despite U.S. warnings against flooding the market.Some analysts argue Russia’s motivations extend well beyond oil and are complicated by the federation’s anger over U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia to Germany. And the price for getting Russia to back down could be too high.“Russia’s concerns with the U.S. go beyond market share. Putin is frustrated with sanctions and may be more interested in punishing the U.S. than Saudi Arabia,” said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and chief executive of drilling services company Canary LLC. “If Trump wants an agreement with Putin, he may have to promise to ease up on sanctions. I am not sure he can deliver without the backing of congress.”Rosneft PJSC over the weekend sold its assets in Venezuela to the Russian government, a move that shields the Russian oil giant from further U.S. sanctions while keeping Moscow behind the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Fears of broader sanctions have grown after the U.S. in recent months slapped restrictions on Rosneft trading companies for handling business with Venezuela.Talks between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies broke down in early March as Russia refused to sign on to larger production cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia.

Six senators from oil-producing states last week urged Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia, while highlighting several “powerful tools at our disposal,” including sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.“Trump would have better success pressing Saudi Arabia than Russia since they are dependent on the U.S. for protection, intelligence and arms sales,” Eberhart said.On the coronavirus, the two sides expressed concern about the scale of its spread, according to the Kremlin.

‘Very, very frightening’: Calls for government bailout grow louder as oilpatch faces bleak outlook
Oil traders say it’s likely to get worse this week.The root cause is an accelerating plunge in consumption that’s without precedent since a steady flow of oil became essential to the global economy more than a century ago. The great crash of 1929, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the global financial crisis don’t come close. The world normally uses 100 million barrels of oil day, and traders and analysts reckon as much as a quarter of that has disappeared in just a few weeks.The global airline industry is grounded, countless businesses and factories are shuttered and billions of people have been forced to stay home.“Demand clearly is off, in some parts of the world, very dramatically,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV.The immediate problem is a lack of storage in the right places. With demand running 20 million barrels a day below supply, the world won’t have enough tanks to store the surplus in two or three months. But the issue is even more pressing because global tank capacity, mostly concentrated in a few hubs like Rotterdam, the Caribbean and Singapore, isn’t available to every producer. For those without access to pipelines and ports, local storage will run out in days, traders and consultants say.

For those with access to the coast, one solution is to use the supertanker fleet as floating storage tanks, and that’s happening at an unprecedented rate. The CEO of the world’s largest tanker owner, Frontline Ltd., said on Friday that he’d never known such demand to hire ships for long-term storage. Traders could put 100 million barrels at sea, he estimated, but even that accounts for just a few days’ oversupply.In the U.S., one of the largest pipeline companies, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has asked oil producers to voluntarily cut output to avoid overwhelming the network that connects well heads to refineries through thousands of miles of pipelines.The world is running out of places to put oil because the shutdown of vast swathes of the economy has been catastrophic for demand. The collapse in commercial air travel has cut jet fuel use by up to 75 per cent, or almost 5 million barrels a day.As for gasoline, American drivers are the single biggest source of demand, using more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. As whole states, including California and New York, have told people to stay home, billions of car journeys have been lost. It’s a pattern repeated in Europe and Asia.“Demand destruction is unprecedented,” said Ben Luckock, co-head of trading at Trafigura Group, the second-largest independent oil trader. He estimates the hit to consumption will total 22 million barrels a day in April.We are facing a catastrophic loss of demandGary Ross 
 
Around the world, about 700 refineries turn crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. They are starting to dial down production and even shut outright because demand for the fuel they produce is so dire. In India, for example, where 1.3 billion people are under lockdown until mid-Aptil, the nation’s biggest refinery has cut processing rates at most plants by as much as 30 per cent.A small refiner in Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s virus outbreak, shut on Friday because demand for fuel plunged 85 per cent.As the refining system withers, the crude oil market is suffering. Many crudes, especially sticky, sulfurous grades that refiners find hard to process, trade at hefty discounts to international benchmarks. Western Canadian Select, a tarry blend squeezed from Alberta’s oilsands, reached a record low of US$4.51 a barrel on Friday.

In the U.S., Oklahoma Sour is changing hands at US$5.75, Nebraska Intermediate at US$8, while Wyoming Sweet prices at US$3 a barrel.In one obscure corner of the American crude market, prices have already turned negative. Wyoming Asphalt Sour, a dense oil used mostly to produce paving bitumen, was bid at minus 19 cents a barrel in mid-March by Trading Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.The surprise, perhaps, is that benchmark futures are still trading as high as they are. Brent, the North Sea grade that sets the price for about two-thirds of the world’s oil, ended last week at US$24.93 a barrel, well above the historic low of US$9.55 a barrel in 1998.Luckock at Trafigura says future prices are likely to fall another US$10. Black Gold’s Ross also says Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will be trading in the teens within days.The next stage of the oil market’s meltdown will be widespread production shutdowns as drillers decide the only option is to leave it in the ground until better days return. There are signs this is starting to happen.Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras has announced it will reduce output by 100,000 barrels a day this year because of the lack of demand. In Canada, some producers have shut down output, and Glencore Plc., the world’s largest commodity trading house, has shut down its production in Chad.Many producers are reluctant to shut wells because even though they’re losing money at today’s prices, some cashflow is often better than none at all. But as more refineries idle, the pipeline system grinds to a halt and storage tanks fill to the brim, they will soon have no choice.“The problem is no one wants to be the first to shut-in,” Black Gold’s Ross said.Bloomberg.com"

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection.

A handful of experts is saying that will happen again.The comeback trail would be steep and long. The spread of coronavirus is crushing demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia are creating a glut. Everybody agrees U.S. production will take a bigger hit than last time, when it dipped before soaring. As many as 70% of the 6,000 shale drillers may go bankrupt, and one-third of shale-patch workers are expected to lose their jobs. Wall Street, which financed the last boom, has cut off the cash spigot.But some experts are saying the future, however far off, will be better. They’re looking past the dire forecasts and vertical chart lines and cautioning against despair. They’re echoing a widespread view that’s mostly unspoken during the market meltdown: Yes, America can shock the world again. The boom-and-bust cycle will shift, and shale is in a position, with its infrastructure, its ability to ramp-up quickly and its plentiful reserves, to rise from the ashes stronger than ever.When the dust settles in the Permian Basin and other American shale fields, the survivors will be leaner and more tech savvy, according to Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit Ltd. That means lower production costs and a greater ability to respond to the next price rebound with the last thing Moscow and Riyadh want — another boom.“Companies go bankrupt, but rocks don’t go bankrupt,” Yergin said in an interview. “When this all shakes out, there will be other people to develop shale.”Noah Barrett also believes the growth engine of U.S. crude production will be humbled, but won’t flicker out. That’s because shale has extensive infrastructure that isn’t going anywhere.“The resource is still there, the pipeline capacity, the processing capacity,” said Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. “Those are still there.”Even if predictions are correct, that overall American oil output will slide to 8 million or 9 million barrels a day, down about one-third from the current 13 million, the U.S. would still count among the world’s very top producers, Barrett said.Bloomberg Intelligence is forecasting a more-modest production falloff of about 1.5 million barrels a day.The weakest companies “will go into stronger hands,” said Vincent G. Piazza, BI’s senior oil analyst. “The industry is going to be in a lot better shape than in 2014-2016. The balance sheet is in a lot better shape. I wouldn’t underestimate the ability of this industry to re-create itself.”Fereidun Fesharaki is a shale believer, too. The chairman of global energy consultant FGE said he also expects the price squeeze to force explorers to become more efficient and cost-competitive.Still, any rays of optimism must penetrate a very dense, dark cloud. In the market cataclysm that’s still unfolding, crude and fuel prices around the world have sunk to levels not seen in nearly two decades.As if by evil magic, the Covid-19 outbreak has chased tens of millions of people from streets, stores, factories and travel hubs, suddenly degrading demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel across the world’s largest economies.Veteran crude analyst Roger Diwan expects global consumption to plunge by more than 14 million barrels a day — the biggest demand shock since the birth of the oil age. The pipeline that hauls 60% of the East Coast’s gasoline supply from the Gulf Coast is cutting capacity by one-fifth. In Chicago, wholesale gasoline tumbled to 15 cents a gallon, the lowest since at least 1992.The virus-driven calamity has been compounded by the disintegration earlier this month of the Russia-Saudi cooperation pact that capped global crude supplies. Because of the rapidly expanding worldwide glut of crude, a barrel of oil in some parts of Texas recently fetched about $16. In Canada, oil traded for less than $10.The price plunge instantly made thousands of prospective shale sites money-losing propositions. Companies have been in such a hurry to cut losses that some have paid early-termination penalties on rigs and other gear to halt work before contracts are up.Slashing SpendingEven Chevron Corp. is retrenching. The California giant, widely recognized as holding some of the richest acreage in the Permian, said Tuesday it was slashing spending by $4 billion and halting share buybacks to conserve cash.In the final three months of 2019, nine explorers and six service companies filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone LLC. That represented $13.5 billion in debt. This year’s churn is just getting started. Mizuho Securities analyst Paul Sankey expects as many as 70% of the 6,000 or so shale drillers to go bankrupt before the cycle turns.But private-equity firms that swooped in to buy ailing explorers and tempting assets during the last bust won’t be able to unfurl a safety net this time. The buy-and-flip model that underpinned their foray into shale has disappeared, forcing those firms to become oilfield operators, which in turn means tapping their own credit facilities, said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy Group, the biggest owner of non-operated U.S. shale assets.Only about one-third of the Permian and other U.S. fields count as sweet spots that can harvest oil profitably at $30 a barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate traded at $21.42 on Friday.“Private equity’s going to be out of the game,” Rainbolt said. “It’s a very, very tough fund-raising market.”In the meantime, service providers — the hired hands of the oil industry who do everything from stack steel pipes to frack wells — will experience extreme pressure, along with the explorers who are demanding price cuts, said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, an indexing and research company. Pipeline owners are somewhat insulated because oil and natural gas still need to be shipped to refiners and export terminals, she said.Shale Threshold“The market is going to be out of balance for quite some time,” Morris said.Yergin, the confidante of oil ministers and chief executives, sees the threshold for reinvigorating shale between $50 and $60 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading above the $50 level as recently as Feb. 26.“At $50, we’ll start to see a recovery and a step up in investment, so long as people feel safe about the price floor beneath them,” he said.It’s funny that Yergin should put it that way. A big part of shale’s resilience lies in its unique geology. Unlike the so-called conventional fields in Saudi Arabia and Russia, North American shale is rock so dense that it doesn’t degrade or collapse on itself if oil production is interrupted. In other parts of the world, disrupting output can do irreversible damage.That’s why the bulk of Chevron’s $4 billion spending cut will take place in the Permian, CEO Mike Wirth said Tuesday. It’s a rare field where production can be turned off almost instantly without adverse long-term impacts.With shale, “the assets don’t go away because you haven’t destroyed the field,” said Ken Medlock, senior director of Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. “We’ll see a thinning of the herd but the assets will still be there.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history.

The small Kansas plant in the heart of rural America was offering just $1.75 a barrel for Wyoming sweet crude.With more than two billion people on virus lockdown from India to California, energy demand has plunged. In corners of the U.S., Canada, Russia and China, oil prices at the well-head are collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented glut.And with it, the industry is bracing for something that last happened on this scale 35 years ago: producers shutting down their wells as pumping crude makes no economic sense.“I have never seen anything like this in the markets,” said Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder of Gunvor Group Ltd., a large commodity trading house. “We’ve never seen anything even close to today.”The oil market — hit by the double blow of a demand slump and a supply surge as Saudi Arabia and Russia wage a price war — is battling a surplus of as much as 20% of global consumption.The consequences are brutal: prices are now low enough to force a widespread suspension of production, or a shut-in as it’s known in the industry. For those waging the price war, it counts as a victory — as long as the shut-ins happen elsewhere.Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarks closely followed in Wall Street, are hovering around $25 a barrel. But in the world of physical oil — where actual barrels change hands — producers are getting much less.The industry is navigating what Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst at Mizuho Bank Ltd, described as “uncharted waters to unknown lands.”Wyoming Sweet, a landlocked crude with few outlets other than American refineries like Coffeyville, is paradigmatic of how the dynamics of the oil market are forcing output cuts. There are others: North Dakota Light Sweet has traded at $9.97 a barrel. Across the border, Western Canadian Select has plunged to $6.45. In Siberia, Russian crude has changed hands for less than $10 and Chinese domestic prices have fallen to single digits.Ultra-low oil prices are starting to work: Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run producer, is cutting output by 100,000 barrels a day from high-cost offshore platforms. Glencore Plc., the commodity giant, is shutting down its oilfields in Chad. In Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. has partially shutdown its Fort Hills oil sands mine.As the pain spreads, industry executives believe many other companies will stem production in the next few days.“We need to cut crude supply by 10 million barrels a day pretty quickly,” said Russel Hardy, the head of top independent oil trader Vitol Group. “Oil prices will need to go lower, to bring the prices to a level that triggers a response.”The last time the oil industry faced widespread shut-ins was in 1986, when Saudi Arabia also ravaged the market in a price war. During the price battles of 1998-99 and 2015-16 the industry also saw cuts, but not on a large scale.Put simply, the world cannot continue pumping at the current level of about 100 million barrels a day while demand is as much as 20% lower. The surplus would overwhelm storage capacity within weeks.In some emerging markets, where infrastructure is less developed, it’s already happening. Pakistan has told refiners to stop importing gasoline and diesel as the tanks are already brimming.Rush to SeaWhere there’s access to the sea, traders use tankers to store oil — and wait for prices to go up. Crude is now moving onto ships at a record pace, according to one of the industry’s largest shipowners.But inland, producers are reliant on sending crude to local refineries like Coffeyville and the lack of storage capacity will be decisive.“The surge in inventory in coming weeks will inevitably saturate local infrastructure, in our view, forcing many inland producers to shut-in wells,” said Damien Courvalin, oil analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Some producers will prefer to take the hit of negative prices — paying someone to take the oil off their hands — to the long-term costs of shutting down a well. In the aftermath of the last major downturn, a North Dakota sour crude went to a negative 50 cents.But as storage fills up, production will have to respond. IHS Markit Ltd., a consultant, estimates the Canadian province of Alberta has inland tanks able to store the equivalent of just 3.2 days of daily production. The central U.S., which includes Wyoming, has room for just 12.8 days’ output.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The credit package was announced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on March 13, but since then the economy has deteriorated. Canada saw 929,000 applications for unemployment benefits last week, smashing records, after businesses across the country were forced to close or reduce services to control the spread of the virus. Bank of Nova Scotia expects Canada’s economy to shrink 28 per cent in the second quarter on an annualized basis, far exceeding the worst of the 2009-09 recession.The government declined to comment directly on the talks.“The Covid-19 Emergency Response Act empowers the government, if necessary, to provide further support and stimulus to the Canadian economy,” Maéva Proteau, a spokeswoman for Morneau, said in an emailed statement Thursday. “With these additional tools, Canadians can have confidence that their government is well equipped to rapidly protect them and our economy in these challenging times.”The Canadian Bankers Association declined to comment.The government has created a $107 billion fiscal stimulus plan to soften the economic blow of COVID-19 on the Canadian economy. It includes $52 billion in direct support for companies and individuals, up from $27 billion announced last week. It also has $55 billion worth of tax deferrals for households and businesses.Parliament approved the government’s fiscal stimulus package early Wednesday.The discussions come at a time when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is also asking banks to provide relief for consumers, including cutting credit card interest rates.“I can assure you that the Finance Minister has had conversations directly with the banks about credit card interest rates.

With only an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of storage capacity still available, producers will be forced to cut output because by June there’ll be no place left to put the unwanted crude, it said.The oil market has been hammered by falling demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and as Saudi Arabia vows to flood the market with crude at deep discounts, following the collapse of the coalition of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia. On Thursday, Pakistan banned imports of crude and fuels because its storage sites are full. Vitol Group and Gunvor Group, two of the world’s top merchants, say there’s heavy interest in storing while several traders have booked supertankers to hoard barrels at sea.

Supply may exceed demand by 12.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, with other traders, banks and consultants also forecasting bumper surpluses, IHS said. Vitol said on Wednesday that demand has fallen as much as 20 million barrels a day from last year.“Production is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,” said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS. “It is now a matter of where and by how much.”U.S. ConcernsThere are already signs in prices about a potential scarcity of storage space. In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world’s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said. Those figures are based on the amount of production that could be stored if exports dried up. Saudi Arabia has 18 days, and the U.S. has 30.Nigeria, the biggest producer in Africa, is the most vulnerable among the areas measured by IHS. Estimated first-quarter 2020 daily production of 1.9 million barrels a day would fill up available local storage in 1 1/2 to two days, the firm said.Consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. also sees storage tanks filling in the coming months.“With OPEC pushing output to record highs, inventories will quickly get out of hand,” the firm said in a note. “We will run out of crude storage capacity by early Q3 20, with product containment arriving earlier.”Bloomberg.com"

“More stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,” Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They’ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program — between $50 billion and $75 billion — to be announced at the central bank’s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.“The BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,” Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.“There is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy — but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,” Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.“We can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,” CIBC’s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"

Big banks to allow delayed mortgage payments to some in unprecedented response to coronavirus crisis
Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced. Customers in good standing who have been impacted by the pandemic can apply, with deferrals available for an indefinite period and no deadline to apply, according to the association.Under the plan, payments are skipped for a period of time, and interest accrued is added to the mortgage’s outstanding balance. The additional interest is incorporated into future monthly payments when they resume, or upon renewal at the end of the mortgage’s term.Canadian banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals, since the relief plan was introduced.“Last week, our contact centres in Canada received close to 80,000 calls per day, with calls to our mortgage and loan teams up 500 per cent,” Scotiabank Chief Executive Officer Brian Porter said in a March 22 statement.Toronto-Dominion is “receiving thousands of requests daily for mortgage deferrals, and have processed thousands already,” spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo said in an emailed statement. “We are moving quickly through applications so that we can help provide our customers some immediate financial relief.”Bloomberg.com"

According to the complaint, RBC said the REIT’s commercial mortgage-backed securities have “drastically declined” in value due to the crisis, allowing the bank to demand additional cash or securities to meet requirements.But the trust says the calls are entirely subjective and don’t actually reflect the true value of the CMBS. While many other banks have agreed not to pursue remedies against mortgage real estate investment trusts, RBC has refused — and planned to hold an auction Wednesday that included US$11 million of the trust’s assets, the lawsuit says.

RBC declined to comment on the lawsuit.The coronavirus is wreaking havoc in the US$16-trillion U.S. mortgage market, which is suffering its worst turmoil in more than a decade. Firms that invest in mortgage-backed securities are facing margin calls and sinking valuations, forcing them to solicit offers on billions in assets in emergency sales.‘Fire-Sale Prices’RBC “is hitting the accelerator to unlawfully seize and unload a large portfolio of plaintiffs’ assets at fire-sale prices into the seized markets which will have a cascading effect in the market for mortgage-based assets,” the lawsuit said.The bank’s auction “would not only dramatically and prejudicially underprice these securities to Plaintiffs’ detriment, but would also likely precipitate a chain reaction of other banks being pressured to foreclose on other mREITs’ pledged securities, all at prices informed by the fire sale that defendants seek to hold,” the trust said in the suit.The REIT is seeking a court order blocking the auction and stopping RBC from taking any actions against its assets “pending compliance with the parties’ agreements and current government guidance and regulations designed to stabilize the economy.”AG Mortgage Investment Trust announced Monday it failed to meet some margin calls and doesn’t expect to be able to meet future margin calls with its current financing. Eric Hagen, an analyst at KBW, said other firms are also likely facing margin calls “especially given the challenging overall environment for sourcing liquidity.”Shares of AG Mortgage Investment Trust rose 27 per cent to US$2.725 in New York Wednesday after earlier rising as much as 69 per cent amid a broad surge in REIT stocks.The case is AG MIT CMO v RBC (Barbados) Trading Corp. 20-cv-2547, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.Bloomberg.com"

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump’s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn’t require members to travel to Washington — as long as the bill does not have any “poison pills” Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the “the president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation’s economy as we work through this crisis.”The size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak.

The latest claims data highlights the rapidity at which the country’s economy is deteriorating as Canadians stay home and governments urge businesses to close, amid efforts to try to control the spread of the coronavirus. Economists have slashed growth forecasts, and they now expect second quarter output to contract by the most in more than half a century.“The rise in EI applications gives us a sneak peak into just how sharp the drop off in economic activity has been over the past few weeks,” said Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “While we really don’t know how long this will last, we do know the hit to GDP will be severe.”Mendes said he expects the unemployment rate to spike to levels higher than even during the worst of the financial crisis.Bloomberg.com"

Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said earlier Tuesday the White House will consider advice from public health officials as the administration moves to encourage Americans to return to work.“We’re not abandoning the health professionals’ advice but there is a clamour to try to re-open the economy, perhaps make it less of a shut-in,” Kudlow said Tuesday to reporters at the White House. “That’s one piece, but it’s yet to be determined.”Trump began discussing how to get Americans back to work last week, just days after issuing guidelines encouraging people to stay away from restaurants and large gatherings and educate their children at home. But he has largely trailed governors and municipal leaders, who have essentially shut down entire states and cities in order to combat the spread of the virus.

That has triggered projections by one Federal Reserve official of a 50 per cent drop in U.S. economic growth.Trump was peppered with questions at a news conference Monday about how soon he would try to end U.S. “social distancing” practices and whether he would follow the advice of government health professionals. “I’ll be listening to them and others we have who are doing a good job,” he answered.One of those professionals, Deborah Birx, the State Department physician who advises Vice President Mike Pence on the government’s response to the outbreak, said at the news conference that she didn’t think Trump’s optimism about soon relaxing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines would hurt compliance.The president also warned Monday that if the economy is forced into a deep enough recession by social distancing measures, there could be deaths from suicides and other causes in excess of those caused by the coronavirus.“Public health includes economic health — that’s a key point. It’s not either-or,” Kudlow said. “That’s why we’re taking a fresh look at it.”Bloomberg.com"

Goldman said the Fed’s move would help alleviate the funding stress that’s driven gold lower, and investors would now pivot to focus on the expansion of its balance sheet, just as they did in 2008. Goldman also highlighted the rise in deficits in developed economies, as well as “issues around the sustainability” of European monetary union, according to a note.

Spot gold climbed as much as 4.2 per cent to US$1,618.20 an ounce, before paring some of the gains. Futures in New York surged to as high as US$1,693.50 an ounce.“We believe this will likely lead to debasement concerns similar to the post-GFC period,” Goldman analysts including Jeffrey Currie and Mikhail Sprogis wrote in the March 23 note, referring to the global financial crisis. “Accordingly, we are likely at an inflection point where ‘fear’-driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure, as it did in November 2008.”Other precious metals also extended gains.

Many see it as inevitable that Poloz and his governing council will cut the overnight rate to near zero, then start rummaging deeper into their toolbox.“We think the bank will be forced to adopt QE and that they’ll look to ultimately buy up to $150 billion in securities,” said TD Securities macro strategist Robert Both in an email. “We think it is a question of when and not if.”Sharp Economic SlideQuantitative easing, which sees central banks buy government bonds as part of an effort to keep borrowing costs low for a prolonged period of time, would be a first for the Bank of Canada, which didn’t follow its peers to such lengths during the 2008 crisis.The global outlook is deteriorating rapidly, forcing central banks into new territory. The Federal Reserve said Monday it will buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to suppress borrowing costs and ease the flow of credit amid a historic economic shock.The Bank of Canada’s governing council often distances itself from monetary policy decisions south of the border. But the Fed’s move opens the door to a more robust response from Canadian policy makers.“The Bank of Canada doesn’t like being pushed by the Fed, but now it’s global,” said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist at Bank of Montreal, which sees an 80 per cent chance the central bank will need to start quantitative easing.“The question is why they’d wait until April — given the broad shutdowns it’s already clear that conditions have deteriorated sharply,” he said.While Poloz said last week that other options are on the table, he made it clear the measures the bank has taken so far — including upping the purchases of mortgage-backed securities — don’t constitute quantitative easing.“The programs the bank has introduced are very important in unlocking funding markets,” Ian Pollick, global head of non-equity market research at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The problem is, liquidity is so distressed that they are not working as planned. They need to bring out the Canadian bazooka,” adding that he’s certain the central bank will “imminently” launch QE.Bloomberg.com"

It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed’s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans.

Following a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.“Wow, just wow,” George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.“Hopefully you’ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you’ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.”In a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed’s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.Economic ShutdownMonday’s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.Not a ‘Slush Fund’“This is not a slush-fund,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. “It’s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That’s on top of the Fed’s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.”Beyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed’s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.“This is a great step forward,” said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. “Getting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.”Other HighlightsTwo more programs were created to support large employers — a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility for new bond and loan issuance, and a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. Yet another program, a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, will “enable the issuance of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and certain other assets. The central bank also said it would expand the existing Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable-rate demand notes Finally, the Fed said it would expand the existing Commercial Paper Funding Facility to also include high-quality municipal debt, another move to help cash-strapped states and cities. “The Fed’s latest moves signal a resounding ‘whatever it takes’ approach from the central bank, and dispel any notion that monetary policy makers are either sparing ammunition or running out of unconventional tools,” Andrew Husby and Carl Riccadonna, of Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note to clients.Bloomberg.com"

AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!” Trump tweeted late Sunday. 
U.S. Federal Reserve pulls out all the stops with unlimited new buying to battle ‘tremendous hardship’ of coronavirus crisis
COVID-19 LIVE UPDATES: Keep an eye on the Bank of Canada after Fed’s unprecedented move
This is what the Bank of Canada has left in its arsenal to fight the coronavirus downturn
The president started talking about how to get people back to work around Thursday, two of the people said, only three days after he helped roll out a 15-day plan from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stem the rise of cases by encouraging most people to stay at home. That campaign would end about March 31.The discussions centred on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who’s sick so healthy people can return to work. It’s likely the CDC guidelines would be relaxed rather than scrapped altogether, one person said.Birx, Fauci AdviceThe government’s top health authorities have warned that in the absence of any viable medical treatment, sustained and economically painful restrictions on daily life are the only way to beat the virus. This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government’s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House’s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump’s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn’t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley said Sunday it expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.There had been more than 35,000 cases of the disease in the U.S. by Monday and more than 400 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Social distancing didn’t begin with Trump’s guidelines and won’t necessarily end if he lifts them, as governors and municipal leaders have the power to issue “shelter in place” and other orders limiting daily life in virus-ravaged parts of the country. But the president has considerable power to influence Americans’ behaviour by the tone he sets at what has become daily, televised White House news conferences.“We’ll get a pretty good idea what we’re doing” at the end of his “15 Days to Slow the Spread” campaign on March 31, Trump said Sunday. “You know there will be a point at which we say: ‘We’re back in business, let’s go.”‘Drop the Hammer’Some of the debate over how rapidly Americans should return to work is beginning to play out in public.Fauci acknowledged that aggressive public health measures can cause too much harm to the economy and “unintended consequences” in an interview with Science magazine published Sunday.“There is a discussion and a delicate balance about what’s the overall impact of shutting everything down completely for an indefinite period of time,” he said. “If you knock down the economy completely and disrupt infrastructure, you may be causing health issues, unintended consequences, for people who need to be able to get to places and can’t. You do the best you can.”Former Goldman Sachs Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in a tweet Sunday night that “within a very few weeks” people at “lower risk to the disease” should return to work.“Is it time to start discussing the need for a date when the economy can turn back on?” Trump’s former economic adviser, Gary Cohn, tweeted on Sunday. “Businesses need clarity. Otherwise they will assume the worst and make decisions to survive.”But another former senior aide to Trump, Steve Bannon, said the president should take even stronger measures to limit Americans’ social interactions over the next two weeks in order to snuff out the virus — or risk irreversible economic damage.“We’re going to have to take the pain up-front. We’re going to have to shut it all down,” Bannon said on Fox News on Sunday. “Drop the hammer today on the virus.”Trump said Sunday he’d seen both comments. “They are not mutually exclusive, they sort of inter-mesh,” he said of Cohn and Bannon. Bannon wants “just a brutal shutdown, and then open up a little bit faster. So you know, there’s that fine line.”Late Sunday and into Monday morning Trump began retweeting supporters expressing exasperation with social distancing efforts.Bloomberg.com"

Today, the banking system is in far better shape. It never feels very good to have this degree of chaos, but this will pass.”Flatt said that while Brookfield had been expecting a recession and “market washout” for some time, no one could have predicted the coronavirus would be the cause. Despite this, he said he believes Brookfield is “very good shape” to weather the storm with US$12 billion in undrawn bank lines and only about 40 per cent of the US$50 billion it raised in its previous fundraising invested.

Flatt said most of Brookfield’s businesses are resilient and therefore he doesn’t see any major issues. While some of its businesses — including the malls and ports it owns — will likely be impacted by people staying home, the bulk of its investments are in critical infrastructure.“While many are at home now, people and companies still need corporate premises, infrastructure, power, broadband, utilities and many other critical services that form the backbone of the global economy, and that Brookfield’s businesses provide,” he said.In addition, Brookfield agreed to acquire a majority interest in Oaktree Capital Group last year in an effort to build out a credit arm and in anticipation of the debt markets unwinding.“Now it’s taking place,” Flatt said. “The team at Oaktree is accelerating the pace of deployment of their current distressed debt fund and preparing to launch their next fund, which we think could significantly exceed the size of their last.”Bloomberg.com"

How bad could the coronavirus crisis get for the economy? Some point to the Great Depression
CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES: Canadian business, economy and market news from the COVID-19 pandemic
What the government is offering you in coronavirus-related benefits and how to get them
The speed of the meltdown in the labour market has no precedent. The largest number of jobless claims for a whole month was 499,200 in 1957, according to Statistics Canada data.“This is of course an unprecedented situation and it is putting a lot of pressure on our system but we’re on it,” Trudeau told reporters Friday at Rideau Cottage, where he is governing from home after his wife tested positive for coronavirus.This is going to be the depression of 2020David Rosenberg 
 
The number highlights just how quickly economic activity has come to a halt as Canadians stay home and governments tell businesses to close to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. It also indicates the depth of the contraction may be worse than even the most pessimistic analysts had feared.‘Depression of 2020’“There are going to be large contractions in economic activity, that’s unavoidable when you’re shutting down portions of the economy,” said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto Dominion Bank. “What you’re ultimately hoping for is you don’t get the negative dynamic on duration.”In Canada’s case, the economy is facing a double whammy of the pandemic and tanking oil prices, devastating an energy sector that still accounts for about one-tenth of output.“This is going to be the depression of 2020,” said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc.The extent of the slowdown also suggests policy makers will need to have a bigger response to keep companies afloat and avoid a long downturn, Rosenberg said. Trudeau’s government has announced an aid package worth $82 billion (US$57 billion), which is mostly temporary tax deferrals. The Bank of Canada has cut its policy rate by a full percentage point, but still has its benchmark above other countries.“It’s one thing to have everybody filing for claims but if they have no job to go back to, it’s going to compound things,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

The shutdowns are contributing to the growing conviction that the world has slipped into its first recession since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.“This is kind of a rolling natural disaster,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. “In terms of the impact on global production, the shutdown outside of China will likely become bigger than the impact from China.”The shock to supply chains, Harris said, is deeper and more sprawling than the trade wars of the past two years and likely to be more prolonged than the storms, earthquakes or floods that have been a source of stress for major industries in the past. He expects factory shutdowns will last into May and possibly longer.Compounding the blow for companies, the initial supply shock has become interwoven with a demand crisis in Europe, the U.S. and other major economies as workers and consumers are ordered to stay home.Apple SuppliersApple Inc., for example, is confronting the impact on component makers in Italy, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea after having weathered the February slowdown in Chinese factories that do the final assembly of products like iPhones and AirPods.In Malaysia, key suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Ibiden Co. have halted production as a result of restrictions on movements imposed by the government. Micron Technology Inc. is affected too, but said an exemption allows “limited semiconductor operations to continue.” Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp. also have facilities there.Peru’s state of emergency and nationwide lockdown have led major mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. to curb copper production there. The same is happening in other mining centers like Chile, Canada and Mongolia, with economists at Scotiabank saying the initial result from the hit in Chile and Peru alone leading to the loss of some 325,000 metric tons of copper production, or about 1.7% of global annual output.In Europe, industrial giants like Volkswagen AG and Airbus SE have shut down assembly lines in an effort both to reduce the spread of the virus and to deal with parts shortages and bottlenecks due to restrictions on travel within Europe.BottlenecksWhile governments in the region have pledged to safeguard the transport of goods as borders are shut to other nonessential travel, traffic disruptions have started to escalate. Trucks lined up for 40 miles near Berlin after the German border to Poland was closed, and diverting passenger cars to alternatives routes brought little relief.The car industry is particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Its fine-tuned logistics are designed to keep storage times to only between 1 and 2 months. The push into electric cars has added to complexity, because production of battery cells requires a steady flow of materials like lithium and cobalt.Germany’s Schaeffler Group, which employs 87,000 worldwide and is a major supplier to car makers, joined peers on Thursday in hammering out emergency plans to cut capacity in Europe and avoid layoffs. Those include reducing working hours and cutting production on certain days.“As we have to reduce production in our plants in the light of the crisis, it was important to us that flexible solutions be quickly established,” said Juergen Wechsler, who represents Schaeffler workers for union IG Metall.Liqui Moly GmbH, a maker of engine oil and lubricants based in the southern German city of Ulm, is suffering dramatic order declines. “If the situation demands it, I will forgo my salary,” Chairman Ernst Prost said.Detroit ShutdownAnton Posner, chief executive officer of supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources, said the move by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to temporarily shut down their U.S. plants will reverberate not only through their suppliers of finished parts but in steel, aluminum and transportation.“We have ships loading steel in Europe next week headed for the U.S., but will there be shipments beyond that with industry shutting down?” he asked. “Who’s going to hold inventory if there’s no consumption?”U.S. steelmaker Commercial Metals says it’s still at work and facing postponements, not yet cancellations. “So all these jobs are going to come back,” said CEO Barbara Smith.She hasn’t had any employees infected. But as a company heavily dependent on infrastructure and other construction projects, she is also worried about job sites being shut down due to infections. All of that has left an enormous cloud of uncertainty hanging over her business, even as she continues to book contracts, like one on Thursday related to a highway expansion in Dallas.“How can I give guidance when I don’t know how long it’s going to last or what all the ripple effects will be?” she asked. “I think it’s irresponsible for anyone to make assumptions right now.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com"

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn’t a Goldman Sachs problem.

“People do come in when they have a cold,” said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. “Sometimes you have that old boss where you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.”Wall Street’s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren’t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he’s facing pressure to be “a tough guy” who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there’s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there’s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank’s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren’t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. “If you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,” Goldman’s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. “Take sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.”The culture that’s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry’s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country’s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.

From their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.’s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan’s home-lending group were told they couldn’t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn’t be possible to bring equipment home yet.“We have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,” a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. “The remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.”Inside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.’s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.“There are managers who will say, ‘We’re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,’” said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. “And then there are others who will say, ‘We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.’”The tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Paul Sorbera 
 
Some London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank’s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it’s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"

The yen, so often a haven amid market stress, slumped in a sign of the extraordinary demand for the greenback, which strengthened for an eighth day versus a basket of its major peers to its highest in at least 15 years. WTI oil rebounded from a plunge to almost US$20 a barrel on Wednesday.Even as Donald Trump dubs himself a “wartime president” and joins foreign policy makers in hurrying to counter an abrupt economic shock, investors seem largely underwhelmed by many of the actions taken so far. The rush into cash and havens has battered risk assets almost everywhere, particularly equities, high-yield bonds and non-dollar currencies.The latest developments include the European Central Bank launching a 750 billion-euro (US$815 billion) debt-buying program to keep borrowing costs in check, and the Federal Reserve’s debut of a program to support money-market mutual funds. Still, stocks continue to fall as investor focus turns to assessing the length of the economic downturn.“It’s a good start and a step in the right direction with the tools that they have available, but they can still do more,” Sue Trinh, global macro strategist at Manulife Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg TV. “There’s much more need for U.S. dollar liquidity to get to where it’s needed the most,” she said. “At the moment the markets are screaming it’s not enough — we need to see more of that.”Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate cleared the second major bill responding to the coronavirus pandemic and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the government might take equity positions as part of corporate rescues.Elsewhere, Australia’s central bank joined the quantitative-easing club by announcing it will enter the government bond market to lower yields, having exhausted its remaining conventional policy ammunition.Here are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index fell 2.5 per cent as of 9:40 a.m. New York time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index decreased 1.2 per cent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 2.7 per cent. The MSCI Emerging Market Index fell 3.3 per cent.

Buffett, the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said earlier this month the effects of the virus and an oil shock were “a big one-two punch.” He later announced that shareholders would be barred from attending his company’s annual meeting given the spread of the virus.The billionaire investor has long favoured investing in stocks over bonds, building up an equity portfolio that topped US$248 billion at the end of last year. Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter, released in February, that it was almost certain that equities would outperform long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments in the long run if current interest rates and low corporate taxes were to persist.But he cautioned in the Yahoo Finance interview, conducted last week and released Wednesday, that he’s not an expert on forecasting the path of rates.“I have never been able to predict interest rates,” Buffett said. “Interest rates are important, but we don’t think they’re knowable.”Bloomberg.com"

The earnings reports to watch to gauge just how hard coronavirus ‘tsunami’ is hitting economy
In the meantime, investors are assessing government rescue plans, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s $82 billion (US$56.7 billion) package rolled out Wednesday that’s worth 3 per cent of GDP.Here are some of their views:Key SupportPhilip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management, which manages $879 billion (US$677 billion) of assets:The S&P/TSX Composite Index has slumped to levels not seen since 2016, when the price of oil bottomed out. The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.“The 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.”“In 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.”“I am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office. The only challenge sometimes is finding a quiet place to work or take a call, as my wife and kids are home too. It’s cozy to say the least.”Liquid ETFsDavid Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.:“When I am talking to the traders, I’m focused on ETFs, it’s because that’s where the volume is and that’s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it’s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that’s what I have been recommending people invest.” He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs.He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said. If the slide falls below the 2016 level, “it’ll mean that defaults are accelerating in this country. And to me, that’s the scary part,” he said.Hunting YieldGreg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments:“We are going to be in a period of prolonged low interest rates and people still need income. Whether that income is going to come from dividend equities or alternative sources, I think that’s going to be apparent,” Taylor said in a phone interview from his home. “Companies that have good dividend payouts, that look pretty stable right now, I think those are going to be areas that could be really attractive investments for the next little while.”“We’ve been telling people, those who’ve got some extra cash on the sidelines, it’s probably not a bad time to start putting some of it to work.”Too Late to SellBruce Murray, chief executive officer at The Murray Wealth Group:Murray Wealth is “hunkering down” and “using the opportunity to upgrade our portfolio.” It’s “too late to sell” and the market turning is more of a medical question to do with the spread of the virus, he said.“Most of the downside is behind us,” he said — be there still may be more.Bloomberg.com"

Speculation had been rising that the Bank of Canada would announce another surprise cut to interest rates at the same time as the government’s aid package. On Friday, Morneau and Poloz made a rare joint appearance in which the central bank announced an emergency half-percentage-point cut to its benchmark rate.Investors are predicting another inter-meeting cut as oil prices move even lower and financial market turmoil persists.“The Bank has probably not lost its sense of urgency and we could see more action today,” Jimmy Jean, a fixed-income strategist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. He added the central bank could “very well go to zero today, in a move that would accompany the fiscal package and send a strong signal that monetary-fiscal coordination is no longer just theory.”Another 50 basis point cut by the Bank of Canada would bring its policy rate to 0.25 per cent, matching its lowest level on record. On Sunday, the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut rates to near zero and the Bank of England also has its rate set at 0.25 per cent.Bloomberg.com

Wild swings in equity markets and thousands in the financial industry working from home have led to questions about whether stock exchanges should remain open. But top regulators and executives of exchange firms have come out in favour of keeping markets open.U.S. indexes climbed on Tuesday, a day after declines triggered circuit breakers that halted trading before the major indexes plunged to their biggest drop since 1987.Jim Toes, chief executive officer of the Security Traders Association, an industry group, said on Tuesday that markets need to remain open to “deal with the economy.”“They can’t close the markets,” Toes said. “They’re functioning, they’re working.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said Monday that stock markets should continue to operate. Clayton said the current environment differs from previous market shocks, such as the 2008 credit crisis or the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, partly because of steps that have been taken to bolster the financial industry since then.“I think our banks are in a much stronger position today than they were then,” Clayton said on CNBC. “This is a demand and supply shock,” he said, adding that he’s concerned businesses might not have access to all the credit they need.Exchanges have largely held up amid surges in volume. That has helped most exchange operators’ stocks outperform the broader market amid the declines.In a Bloomberg Television interview, Nasdaq Inc. CEO Adena Friedman said trading should continue for the sake of investors and to allow companies to raise needed capital. Closing the markets could “create other pent-up issues,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker.Terrence Duffy, the CEO of CME Group Inc., the world’s largest futures exchange, said Monday on Bloomberg Television that shutting markets could be “a very large mistake.”“This is not a financial crisis,” Duffy said. “This is a medical crisis.”Closing markets would create more market anxiety, said Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, in a tweet on Monday.Bloomberg.com"

The outlook, however, seems to be deteriorating quickly. The price of Canadian heavy crude slumped Wednesday below US$10 a barrel for the first time after oil-sands producers were forced to delay maintenance, pushing more oil into the market at the worst possible time.“Right now we are focused on making sure that people who are not getting an income or revenue because of this COVID-19 challenge have the money to be able to pay for groceries, pay their rent, and support their families through this difficult time,” Trudeau said.At a separate press conference, Finance Minister Bill Morneau called Wednesday’s measures the “first phase” of the response and said the government is prepared to do more if needed. “I will do whatever it takes,” he said. “There will be more to come.”

Global financial markets are continuing to slide as the economic fallout from the pandemic outpaces even the massive response from governments and central banks.Trudeau also confirmed an announcement earlier by President Donald Trump that Canada and the U.S. have agreed to close the world’s longest undefended border to all non-essential traffic.The measures announced Wednesday include steps to bolster child benefit payments, a $10 billion emergency care program to workers who stay home and don’t have access to paid sick leave, and a 10 per cent wage subsidy to eligible small businesses for the next 90 days. The bulk of the support is a plan to allow taxpayers to defer filing until after Aug. 31 — a temporary liquidity support.Wednesday’s package brings the support offered to businesses and individuals to more than $500 billion during the crisis, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. The country’s banking regulator is loosening capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity, while the country’s housing agency is buying up to $50 billion in mortgages to provide liquidity.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who was also at the Morneau press conference, has cut interest rates by a full percentage over the past two weeks and moved aggressively to keep money flowing through credit markets.

The spread of the coronavirus in the Bay Area prompted several counties to implement a shutdown this week, calling for people to shelter in place and shutter businesses unless they’re essential. Tesla is one of the largest employers in Alameda County, which reported 18 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Monday. The county’s public health department referred inquiries about Tesla to the company.Musk told his millions of Twitter followers on March 6 that “the coronavirus panic is dumb.” The electric car-maker has said little publicly about how it’s handling the virus, in contrast with other automakers and Silicon Valley’s leading technology companies.The coronavirus panic is dumb— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2020But Tesla has some experience to rely on: its Chinese factory near Shanghai was temporarily shuttered earlier this year and is now back online.“My frank opinion remains that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself,” Musk wrote in the email on Monday. “If there is a massive redirection of medical resources out of proportion to the danger, it will result in less available care to those with critical medical needs, which does not serve the greater good.”Tesla shares pared a decline of as much as 11 per cent to trade down 2.5 per cent as of 11:30 a.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock, which was up 119 per cent for the year as of Feb. 19, erased its 2020 gains in early intraday trading.Some employees probably will opt to stay home and assembly lines likely will be slowed, Chris McNally, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a report. He assumes Tesla will lose output of as much as 10,000 vehicles and burn through up to US$1.2 billion in the first quarter, more than double his original bear-case scenario.Tesla has not said how many cars it expects to produce and deliver in the first quarter. In January, the company said deliveries should “comfortably” exceed 500,000 units for the year.

A day after President Donald Trump conceded the U.S. slump alone is set to be “a bad one,” economists threw away their forecasts that the world could avoid tumbling into recession for the first time since the financial crisis.Behind the rethink: The virus’s spread to Europe and the U.S., as well as new evidence that China — the first to be hit by what is now a pandemic — experienced a harder hit to its economy than originally projected.Morgan Stanley’s team, led by Chetan Ahya, said a worldwide recession is now its “base case,” with growth expected to fall to 0.9 per cent this year. At Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius and colleagues predict a weakening of growth to 1.25 per cent. S&P Global added its voice to the chorus with a report expecting that growth would range 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent.

David Rosenberg: Stop looking to 2008, this crisis is more like 9/11
Such slumps would not be as painful as the 0.8 per cent contraction of 2009, as measured by the International Monetary Fund, but they would be worse than the downturns of 2001 and the early 1990s. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs anticipate a rebound in the second half, but warn that the risk remains of even greater economic pain. The projections will apply further pressure on policy makers to do more to limit the health emergency and to deliver stimulus that helps companies and consumers through the shock and then drives a rebound in demand afterward.Although the U.S. Federal Reserve and fellow central banks have been active in loosening monetary policy, most governments have been slow in responding and are only now crafting fiscal packages that may still fail to pacify worried investors.“While the policy response will provide downside protection, the underlying damage from both COVID-19’s impact and tighter financial conditions will deliver a material shock to the global economy,” Morgan Stanley’s economists said.Writing PrescriptionsThe outlook could darken even further if the virus lasts longer than anticipated, or wields greater economic pain — given factories, schools, restaurants and shops are closing around the world. A freezing up of markets or a continued sluggishness by governments to act are also regarded as threats.Elsewhere on Wall Street, strategists are laying out what governments should be doing.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., John Normand advocated developed economies repeating their handiwork of the crisis when they delivered fiscal stimulus worth 1 per cent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. George Saravelos, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said governments may also need to step in to guarantee support for households and companiesWhile the Fed gets “full marks” for its recent response in cutting rates and moving to stabilize credit markets, Northern Trust Corp. Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said Congress and the White House have so far failed to act boldly enough.“The other side of Washington really needs to step up with something as substantial in size, and intelligent in design,” he said.China is experiencing the biggest pain, and most economists failed to capture how far it would fall, with the likelihood now that its economy will suffer the worst turmoil in many decades. The Morgan Stanley economists now reckon its economy shrank 5 per cent in the second quarter.Since the outbreak originated in China, data is being treated by many as a harbinger of what’s to come in other regions. Morgan Stanley predicts the U.S. and European economies will suffer the most in the second quarter.Predictions for the U.S. still vary wildly, with some guessing activity could even decline as much 10 per cent on an annualized basis in the three months through June. Goldman Sachs is penciling in a 5 per cent dive after zero growth in the first quarter.“The middle two quarters of this year are going to be very challenging, even if we get the spread of the coronavirus under control quickly,” said Tannenbaum.Bloomberg.com"

So, there is a lot more work to do.”Georgieva added that the IMF “stands ready to mobilize its US$1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership.” She praised the swap lines announced by central banks on Sunday, saying that going forward there may be a need for swap lines to emerging-market economies.The comments come after Georgieva said earlier this month that the global economic outlook has shifted to “more dire scenarios” and that it’s still difficult to predict the economic impact of the virus. Meanwhile, the fund on Friday ordered all staff at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee was diagnosed with the virus. Bloomberg.com"

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank’s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used. The Fed’s key rate is now 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent, matching the record low it was last at in 2015.

President Donald Trump, who as recently as Saturday attacked the Fed for not lowering rates faster and further, quickly expressed support for the move.“It makes me very happy and I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,” he said. “That’s a big step and I’m very happy they did it.”U.S. stock futures tumbled steeply after the announcement, as investors worried that emergency measures by the Fed would fall short in countering the virus’s damage to the economy. Treasury futures surged in early Asia trading, giving rise to expectations that parts of the U.S. yield curve could soon turn negative.Powell told reporters on the call that the rate decision Sunday is in lieu of the Fed’s regularly scheduled meeting this week, planned for Tuesday and Wednesday.Big GunsThe action comes as the U.S. economy faces sharply curtailed activity in everything from basketball games, to dining out and travel. That’s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday’s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country’s record 11 year expansion could end in recession. Stocks have already tumbled into a bear market.“The Fed cannot combat a public health crisis, but they can provide a helpful hand when the crisis abates,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economic research at Renaissance Macro Research LLC.The Fed said it will keep interest rates near zero “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.”The central bank acted the day before leaders from the Group of Seven nations, including Trump, are set to discuss their virus response on a teleconference. Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.Global Easing in 2020“The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,” it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed’s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress’s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response — in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed’s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move — alone — failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.“The Fed’s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they’re really inventing new stuff,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.“This is not enough,” she said. “The Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is. They’re going to have to step it up a lot more.”Bloomberg.com"

Getting out of the market is easy — getting back in is the hard part
Canadian, U.S. stocks open sharply higher as investors pin hopes on stimulus
‘More likely than not’: Recession question takes on new urgency as blows to economy mount
Before the market opened on Thursday, Bloomberg gathered with three top investors to discuss where we go from here. Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here’s a synopsis of the discussion.Market Structure TestFinancial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that’s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. “Historically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,” she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. “Liquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that’s certainly what we’re seeing right now.”Either way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.“They are not traditional market makers any longer,” said McCreadie. “I think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.”Oil And TroubleThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country’s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.“If you look at the impact on the oil market, it’s very, very negative for Western Canada,” Vanderhooft said. “As bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.”Smaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.“This time around a lot of these smaller players aren’t going to make it,” he said. “I think you’re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.”The increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks’ thinking more now, said Marks. “You already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.”Vanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a “more negative position” on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.Carry OnAll three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.“2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn’t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,” McCreadie said, adding there’s unlikely to be “system failure” now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear marketKevin McCreadie 
 
“We’re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,” he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. “I think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.”Marks said BMO hasn’t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. “In conversations with clients, we haven’t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that ‘Get me out of the market’ across the board.’”“We will get through this event,” McCreadie said. “We always do.”Next Steps“You talk about fully balanced portfolios, that’s where clients need to be,” said Vanderhooft. “At times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that’s the case.”McCreadie’s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth’s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November. While stocks have become cheaper, the lack of visibility makes it “hard to have conviction to step in,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

That added to optimism after the Federal Reserve said it was buying $37 billion of bonds across maturities.Canada’s main stock index closed Friday with a 9.6 per cent advance to regain some of the ground it gave up Thursday in its biggest one-day drop on record.The S&P/TSX composite index was up 1,1207.88 points or 9.6% at 13,716.33, a day after giving up more than 1,700 points.In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1,985.00 points at 23,185.62.

The dollar surged along with Treasury yields and stress in the credit markets showed signs of easing. Precious metals fell, with silver down almost 9 per cent and palladium posting its worst week on record.The S&P 500’s gain Friday was its biggest since 2008, even as the gauge lost 11 per cent this week.After days of no or inadequate action, policy prescriptions came fast Friday. As Trump announced his plans, Congress was also working on a relief bill. The European Union prepared to suspend government spending rules, and regulators in Italy and Spain banned short-selling on some stocks. China’s central bank said it would pump in $79 billion to bolster the economy.Other markets remained exceptionally volatile. The yen tumbled. Ten-year Treasuries swung from gains to losses. Sovereign bonds sank across most of Europe for a second day amid criticism of European Central Bank measures to address the pandemic. The dollar headed for its best week since 2016.“It’s possible we’re just recovering a portion of yesterday’s losses on the idea that there were no terrible headlines this morning,” said Christopher Jacobsen, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group. “The market had priced in the extreme dour outcome and the lack of newsflow this morning to confirm that worst-case scenario resulted in just a bit of a relief rally.”Even with Friday’s gains, global equities posted their worst week since 2008 as investors price in a severely weaker economic outlook. Cases are continuing to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses are weighing on sentiment. The Bank of Japan on Friday followed an earlier move from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity.“It seems that the more severe things become in the short term, the more extreme will be the fiscal and monetary policy response,” Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, wrote to investors. “It is very conceivable that the full boost from such measures will only really kick in just as activity rebounds, with pent up demand leading to a turbo-charged recovery in the second half of the year in the wake of an economic contraction in the context of the first half.”These are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index climbed 9.2% at the close of trading in New York.

Canadian recession is likely without fiscal stimulus: Scotiabank
A growing chorus of economists believe Canada is on the brink of recession as the economy takes a double hit from the coronavirus and tanking oil prices, ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to boost its fiscal stimulus package.Don’t bank on a quick bounce, at least according to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “The caveat here is that we do not believe there is a V-shape recovery given the magnitude of the recent technical damage in market internals,” the bank’s technical analyst Sid Mokhtari said in a note to clients.Crude oil slumped further after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would restrict travel from Europe for the next 30 days in an attempt to contain the coronavirus, pummeling fuel demand.Trudeau is in self-isolation and working from home while his wife awaits the results of a Covid-19 test.

The stock rout was worldwide, with Europe’s benchmark index down 11 per cent in a record drop. Brazil’s Ibovespa tumbled as much as 20 per cent at one point, extending this year’s loss to almost 50 per cent in dollar terms. Canada’s main gauge was off more than 12 per cent, it’s worst day since 1940.Ten-year Treasury yields erased declines and inched higher as policy makers’ pledge of US$1.5 trillion in liquidity recalled the quantitative easing used during the financial crisis. Oil and precious metals fell, with palladium entering a bear market as it tumbled more than 20 per cent Thursday.The S&P 500 entered a bear market, wiping out all its gains since the end of 2018. Now investors are trying to guess at the effectiveness of policy makers’ measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and limit its economic damage. Trump’s travel ban and tepid fiscal measures failed to impress most observers. Spirits were further damped by new bans on public gatherings in the U.S. and professional sports leagues’ move to suspend operations.“Markets likely need more. More innovation from central banks, more targeted help for the most vulnerable parts of the economy — and action from fiscal authorities to stop this transitory shock from developing into a more prolonged insolvency crisis,” said Seema Shah, a global investment strategist for Principal Global Investors. “Emotion is now driving markets.”On another bruising day across markets:The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes are all in a bear market now, with losses from February closing records extending well past 20 per cent. The slump triggered the second 15-minute trading halt this week shortly after the U.S. open. The MSCI All-Country World Index extended losses to enter bear-market territory. The cost of insuring debt issued by Europe’s investment grade companies surged to the highest since 2016. Japanese stocks closed more than 4 per cent lower even after another liquidity pledge from the country’s central bank. Australian shares sunk deeper into a bear market despite a stimulus plan there. Oil extended losses past 5 per cent. Bitcoin took a dive. Gold fell below US$1,600 an ounce. More bad news about the impact of the coronavirus further sapped investor spirits. The leading U.S. infectious-disease official said the testing system in the country is failing. The European Union warned of sickness threatens to exceed health-care capacity across the region “in a few weeks or even days.” The National Hockey League followed the National Basketball Association’s lead and suspended its season.“Market moves suggest monetary stimulus has reached its limits,” said Lucas Bouwhuis, a portfolio manager at Achmea Investment. “Most of the stimulus needs to come from the fiscal side and we are just not seeing enough of that yet.”Meanwhile, signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.“The risks have definitely risen,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The question is how long will this last and I don’t think anybody can predict that at this point.”Bloomberg.com"

Indeed, its earlier advance due to its status as a haven during market turmoil may be why gold is being dragged down now.“Liquidity needs will be a key driver in the short term,” said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Plc. “Gold is one of the few assets that has outperformed, enabling investors to take profit rather than consolidate losses.”Margin CallsTraders say that the unrelenting rout in global equities is triggering margin calls, spurring investors to look for opportunities where they can cash in.

European stocks tumbled more than 8 per cent. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 0.65 per cent.

A rapid rise in coronavirus cases globally, the sharp fall in oil prices and volatility in financial markets make a contraction in the second and third quarters this year “likely” in the absence of fiscal measures, Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at Scotiabank, said Wednesday.“A reasonably mild recession appears likely unless timely and targeted fiscal measures are deployed in the very near future to deal with the economic impacts of the virus,” Perrault wrote in a research note. 
Alberta eyes curtailment to ensure ‘a survival price’ as province stares down recession
Canada’s big banks have a sunny first quarter — but storm clouds are already here
The case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released $1.1 billion in new funding earlier Wednesday in response to the virus, and said the government is ready to do more if necessary. Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada’s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country’s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank’s isn’t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada’s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That’s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank — Jean-François PerraultSees Canada’s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP. Without fiscal stimulus, Q2 and Q3 GDP will contract. Expects the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the next two meetings.Bank of Montreal — Michael GregoryLowers 2020 GDP to 0.5 per cent from one per cent, and sees Q2 contracting by 3.5 per cent. Expects Bank of Canada to cut rates by 100 basis points over the next two meetings to 0.25 per cent.JPMorgan — Silvana DiminoRevises down 2020 forecast to one per cent or 1.1 per cent Q4/Q4 basis. Predicts no growth in Q2 and a two per cent rebound in Q3.

Sees Canada on “verge of recession” with a zero per cent Q1, -0.5 per cent Q2, 0.25 per cent Q3 and one per cent Q4.

Now, stocks have buckled under concern that the virus and a new downturn in the oil sector will hammer the economy.The WHO declaration and no comments on stimulus from President Donald Trump rattled markets. Trump said late in the market session that he’d make a statement Wednesday night on the administration’s plans. European officials signalled a growing willingness to move soon to combat the virus’s effects on the region’s economy.Signs that companies in the hardest-hit industries were drawing down credit lines to battle the effects of the virus on their businesses added to anxiety.“We have no idea when the coronavirus, the spread, is going to subside. That uncertainty is going to continue to create a lot of volatility,” said David Spika, the president of GuideStone Capital Management. “We have no idea how to model it, we have no idea what to expect from it.”Here are the main moves in global markets:Private equity titan Blackstone Group Inc. asked companies it controls to draw down their bank credit lines to help prevent any liquidity shortfalls.

The yen surged 1 per cent, while the euro advanced with the pound. Crude sank 4.2 per cent to sink below US$33 a barrel. Asian equities lost 1.7 per cent. U.S. stocks extended their three-week slide as investors grappled with the potential economic hit from the virus that is upending daily routines around the world. Policy makers are seeking to assure traders they’re on alert, with the ECB indicating it may move as soon as this week, the Bank of England cutting rates and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledging to do “whatever is necessary” to bolster the economy.In the U.S., the Trump administration continues to promise “major” stimulus, but details remain uncertain. Democrats plan to urge the president to declare a national state of emergency. Markets are now growing worried that whatever does come will not have the ability to stave off a major blow to the world’s largest economy.“Every day we get whipsawed back and forth, and what we’re seeing today is general disappointment that fiscal policy is not at all clear in how it’s going to stimulate the economy,” said Michael Reynolds, an investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Co.Meanwhile, Joe Biden cemented his position as front-runner for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination with primary victories Tuesday, further easing concerns among those opposing Bernie Sanders’s progressive platform.Bloomberg.com"

While there’s no immediate plan to adjust the province’s program limiting oil output, the government will monitor inventories and step in if storage nears capacity.“We will use the curtailment tool responsibly to ensure at least a survival price for our producers to get through this,” Kenney said.

Companies’ ‘bank lines will be cut’: Oilpatch pummelled as oil price crash raises fears of job losses
Alberta’s government has pledged to do what’s necessary to shore up its oil-dependent economy after world crude prices fell the most since 1991 this week amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The two countries’ battle over control of the global oil market comes as the coronavirus pandemic has obliterated energy demand. The sudden collapse in oil prices hit Canadian oil companies hard, prompting oil sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. to slash capital spending by 32% and cancel its crude-by-rail program.After conversations with business leaders in recent days, Kenney said he’s also considering payroll tax relief and using the province’s balance sheet to help companies with their current liquidity crisis.Canada’s oilpatch was already struggling with pipeline shortages that prompted the province to impose production limits on its largest producers at the start of last year. The government had started relaxing those restrictions prior to the market downturn.While no new pipelines are expected to be constructed before year-end at the earliest, increasing volumes of crude have been flowing to the U.S. Gulf Coast on rail lines. Those shipments are now threatened after heavy Western Canadian Select’s price tumbled, with its discount to West Texas Intermediate futures shrinking to US$12.75 a barrel on Wednesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s too small a price difference to support most crude-by-rail shipments, which require a US$15 to US$18 a barrel discount.Western Canadian oil stockpiles, stored primarily in hubs at Edmonton and Hardisty, Alberta, had reached 37 million barrels at the end of December, Imperial Oil Ltd. executives said in January. Inventories declined to 32 million barrels near the end of January, they said, citing Genscape data.“If producers stop rail shipments, Hardisty will fill and the differentials will widen,” said Brent Osmond, president of crude-by-rail company Clover Oil & Gas LLC. “This further depresses the realized price for Canadian crude, and exacerbates an already difficult situation.”Bloomberg.com"

In Sweden, cash is almost extinct and people implant microchips in their hands to pay for things
Behind the scenes, some industry groups and banks have been urging the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to issue a statement assuring Americans that there’s minimal risk for using cash, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The Fed, in turn, says it’s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it’s safe.The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue.On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it’s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low — comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail.‘Hygienic’ PaymentsIf, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry’s long-running “war on cash,” sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees. That could even boost interest-bearing credit card balances.Firms such as Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., American Express Co., PayPal Holdings Inc. and a slew of large card-issuing banks would be among the top beneficiaries.

The virus may end up serving as a “trigger event” for wider acceptance of cards long term, either persuading retailers to start taking them or prompting the government to force them, said Lisa Ellis, an analyst independent research boutique MoffettNathanson. The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said.“Digital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,” she said. “This is another reason: ‘Oh, and it’s hygienic too.’”Fighting for PoorAnd on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going “cashless.” Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted.Some of those groups worry they’re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus.“Going cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,” said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. “We certainly wouldn’t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you’re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.”Despite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10.

Roughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked — with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open.“If you want to go that direction, it’s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,” John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. “There’s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.”Paper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects. One study in 2013 showed the dollar has the ability to show “significant and prolonged carriage” of the dreaded Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria known as MSRA.A 2020 study of coronaviruses, which included SARS and MERS, showed the microbes can persist on surfaces for as long as nine days. That can be reduced significantly using ethanol-based disinfectant, according to the study, but cleaning a paper bill proves more difficult than a plastic surface like a desk.Confronted with COVID-19, the People’s Bank of China began using ultraviolet light and high-temperature ovens to disinfect cash coming in. It has also replaced old notes with newly minted bills.

The Fed is staying in contact with the CDC to make sure it’s aware of the agency’s latest thinking on how the virus spreads, a spokeswoman for the central bank said.So far during the current outbreak, the Fed hasn’t widely enacted its longstanding protocol for banks handling bills suspected of being dangerous: First stacking them in “straps” of 100, then bundling those into larger bricks and packaging them in plastic bags with the word “CONTAMINATED” scribbled in permanent ink.Even if the virus compels more people to use cards, the world’s largest payments network will still be battling the broader slowdown in spending, especially in the travel sector.“In the near term, at this point, coronavirus is a clear negative because of disproportionate impact on international travel and consumer discretionary spend,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat said in an interview. “People are just not traveling internationally and this is one of the most profitable businesses that these companies have.”Bloomberg.com"

That’s in addition to the 24 Max that Air Canada received before regulators banned the jetliner from commercial flight after two fatal accidents.Air Canada’s shrinking appetite underscores the rising risk of cancellations for the Max, which could worsen as the coronavirus outbreak saps demand for new jets. Customers have leverage to scrap orders or strike new deals for aircraft when shipment has been delayed by a year or more. The worldwide grounding of the Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane, will reach the one-year mark on March 13.

On Monday, U.S. stocks had their steepest one-day drop since the financial crisis. Buffett, 89, said in the interview that the current market turmoil is still less pronounced than the panic in 2008 that spread to money-market funds and commercial paper.The virus is “scary stuff,” Buffett said in an interview with CNBC last month. “I don’t think it should affect what you do in stocks. But, in terms of the human race, it’s scary stuff when you have a pandemic.”Bloomberg.com"

In February, Saudi Arabia produced about 9.7 million barrels a day.Welcome to the free market.

It’s the latest manoeuvre in what’s set to be a long and bitter conflict between Russia and Saudi Arabia. On Monday benchmark oil prices fell more than 20 per cent, the largest one-day drop in almost 30 years, creating mayhem in global equity and bond markets.

There's risk of production shut-ins in Canada amid oil price crash
Oil prices initially pared gains on Tuesday, but later resumed its advance amid a broader rally in global markets. Brent crude was trading 9.4 per cent higher at US$37.54 a barrel at 10:49 a.m. in London. The benchmark plunged 24 per cent on Monday, the biggest drop in almost 30 years.Moscow responded within minutes in what looked like a war of words, with Alexander Novak, the country’s energy minister, saying Russia had the ability to boost production by 500,000 barrels a day. That would put the country’s output potentially at 11.8 million barrels a day — a record.War StrategyThe outcome of the price war will be determined by Saudi Arabia and Russia’s ability to inflict damage, but also their ability to absorb it.Saudi Arabia has greater offensive abilities, thanks to about 2 million barrels a day of idle production capacity. Riyadh can also use its strategic oil stocks to boost supplies at very short notice, according to people familiar with its strategy.On top of domestic stockpiles, it also stores crude near consumption hubs in Rotterdam, Okinawa and the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir. Russia doesn’t have a network of strategic oil stocks to match.Russia may have the defensive advantage. The Kremlin can dip into its US$150 billion wealth fund to offset the slump and bolster the ruble. Those reserves are sufficient to cover lost revenue “for six to 10 years” at oil prices of US$25 to $30 a barrel, the Finance Ministry said.Should Brent crude remain at US$35 without an adjustment in Saudi spending, the kingdom would run a deficit of nearly 15 per cent of economic output in 2020, while its net foreign reserves could run out in about five years unless it uses other funding sources, according to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.Free Market“Welcome to the free market,” said Bob McNally, founder of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. “The world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stability, not only for the global oil market but the broader economy and geopolitics.”For decades, the oil market has been largely regulated. First by Americans, who set production quotas for their oil companies through the Texas Railroad Commission in the first half of the 20th century, and later by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel. Through that time, Texas and later OPEC acted as swing producers, upping output at times of scarcity and reducing it at times of lower demand, to keep prices stable.With oil demand rapidly falling due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, the Saudi production hike, followed potentially by another one from Russia, is likely to force oil companies to store crude, rather than process it. Traders are already seeking out tankers to store the glut.The International Energy Agency earlier this week said that global oil demand will contract this year for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.The U.S. and other Western countries are starting to worry about the oil price war between two of the world’s most powerful petroleum nations. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Energy denounced in a rare statement “attempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets”.Even as both sides ramped up production and the war of words, Novak said the door wasn’t closed to future talks. He said OPEC+ could meet in May or June. Bloomberg.com"

Western Canada Select, the benchmark grade produced by Canada’s oil sands, was down about 19 per cent to US$22.71 a barrel on Monday, in line with the 20 per cent drop for West Texas Intermediate.Canadian producers, particularly those focused in the higher-cost oilsands, have spent years trying to make their operations more efficient. They’ve also curtailed capital spending and worked to repair their balance sheets. Now those efforts will be put to the test.

Oil crash sends a new shock through world already crippled by coronavirus
“At these commodity prices, nobody is making money and everybody is going to be free cash flow negative,” said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. “It’s going to be tough.”The oil decline hammered Canadian energy stocks. The 30-company S&P/TSX energy index plunged as much as 22 per cent Monday, its biggest intraday decline in Bloomberg data stretching back to 1988. Among the biggest decliners were Cenovus Energy Inc., which dropped as much as 49 per cent, and MEG Energy Corp., which tumbled as much as 47 per cent.To be sure, the long period of retrenchment leaves some Calgary-based producers better prepared for the current crisis than they were for the 2014 crash, which saw U.S. crude prices plummet from above US$100 a barrel in July 2014 to about US$26 less than two years later.For example, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest integrated oil company, last month reported a cash operating cost of $28.55 per barrel in its oilsands operations last quarter, down 17 per cent from five years ago. The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Below Break EvenCanadian energy companies “are better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,” Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. “While in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.”However, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels — WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time — some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.“The industry simply doesn’t work at these prices,” Ollenberger said. “I don’t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands. I mean the industry globally doesn’t work at these prices.”Bloomberg.com"

Monday’s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country’s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.“It’s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,” Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are “quite a lot to bear” if sustained, Caranci added.

Oil price war tests Canadian energy producers' years-long drive to cut costs
The oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growthBeata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank 
 
“Given market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,” Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 — in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week’s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.Trudeau’s TurnThe Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada’s oil sector isn’t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.“Yes, it’s a negative, that’s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,” Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada’s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country’s financial system.According to the finance department’s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government’s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall’s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"

“Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy,” said Rohitesh Dhawan, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group in London.There are winners from rock-bottom oil prices — among them China, the world’s largest oil importer, whose recovery from the virus will be key for the global economy.Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy 
 
But this time is different. The U.S. — once a winner from low oil — is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks — on the way up — used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.“Lower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,” said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. “But now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.”Russian StrategyThe crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there’s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday’s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry — when prices went as low as US$26 — contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year’s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown 
 
Russia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it’s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency — unlike Saudi Arabia — and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.“Russia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic — and even political — self-harm didn’t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia’s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Aramco RoutSaudi Aramco — the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince’s credibility on the line — saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.“Oil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,” said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.

More immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred — as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc — though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it’s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.“Sharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors’ energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,” said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “In the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.”The crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry’s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.Going GreenA slowdown in green plans isn’t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use — increasing emissions — and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe — which is leading the charge on climate change policies — the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn’t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.“The Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it’s not clear this will work,” said the LSE’s Hertog, author of ‘Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia’.“In the end, this will be Putin’s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.”Bloomberg.com"

As the global oil benchmark plummeted to as low as US$31.02 a barrel, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned prices could drop to near US$20 a barrel.The cataclysmic plunge will resonate through the energy industry, from giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. to smaller shale drillers in West Texas. It will hit the budgets of oil-dependent nations from Angola to Kazakhstan and could also reshape global politics, eroding the influence of countries like Saudi Arabia. The fight against climate change may suffer a setback as fossil fuels become more competitive versus renewable energy.“It’s unbelievable, the market was overwhelmed by a wave of selling at the open,” said Andy Lipow, president of Houston-based energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC. “OPEC+ has clearly surprised the market by engaging in a price war to gain market share.”Hammered by a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus, the oil market is sinking deeper into chaos on the prospect of a supply free-for-all. Saudi Arabia slashed its official prices by the most in at least 20 years over the weekend and signalled to buyers it would ramp up output — an unambiguous declaration of intent to flood the market with crude. Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could.Aramco’s unprecedented pricing move came just hours after the talks between Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies ended in dramatic failure. The breakup of the alliance effectively ends the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.The state-owned Saudi producer has privately told some market participants it plans to raise output well above 10 million barrels a day next month and could even reach a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.Oil prices have suffered massive drops each time that Saudi Arabia has launched a price war to drive competitors out of the market. West Texas Intermediate fell 66 per cent from late 1985 to March 1986 when the country pumped at will amid a resurgence of U.S. oil output. Brent crude briefly dropped below US$10 a barrel when the kingdom had a showdown with Venezuela in the late 1990s.With oil demand already plummeting due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, traders forecast that prices will drop even further. “The oil market is now faced with two highly uncertain bearish shocks with the clear outcome of a sharp price sell-off,” said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York.Brent for May settlement tumbled as much as US$14.25 a barrel to US$31.02 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, the biggest intra-day loss since the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in January 1991. It pared some of those losses to trade 22 per cent lower at US$35.39 a barrel as of 8:04 a.m. in Singapore.West Texas Intermediate crude plunged 22 per cent to US$32.22 a barrel after sliding as much as 27 per cent to US$30 a barrel just after the open. Trading was frozen for the first few minutes because of the scale of the loss.While the price crash was dramatic, for oil specialists the movements in time-spreads, options and volatility are just as remarkable. Brent’s three-month price structure widened sharply as oil for prompt delivery collapsed against later shipments. It moved deeper into contango, a sign of bearishness and oversupply, making it profitable for physical traders to buy crude and put it in storage, either in onshore tank farms or at sea on tankers.The plunge in oil also ricocheted across financial markets. U.S. equity futures plunged, along with oil currencies including the Norwegian krone and Mexican peso, while havens such as the Japanese yen and gold jumped. Shares of oil producers got hammered, with Australia’s Santos Ltd. and Oil Search Ltd. losing more than 20 per cent in early Sydney trading.The prospect of another price war is spooking traders who will remember the crash that began in 2014, when an explosion in U.S. shale production prompted OPEC to open the spigots in an attempt to suppress prices and curtail shale output.That strategy ended in failure, with shale producers proving too resilient and Brent crude tumbling below $30 a barrel in 2016 amid a global glut. It was that crash that prompted OPEC to club together with Russia and others to curtail output and help shore up their oil-dependent economies. Bloomberg.com"

The kingdom plans to accompany the price cuts with a hike in crude supply, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price warIman Nasseri at oil consultant FGE 
 
Aramco’s pricing announcement is the first major marketing decision since producer talks in Vienna ended in dramatic failure on Friday, when Saudi Arabia was unable to persuade Russia to agree to prolonged and deeper cuts in output. Saudi production is set to exceed 10 million barrels a day next month, according to the people, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations. Such an increase would amount to more than 3 per cent of Saudi output in February.“Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price war,” said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at oil consultant FGE.The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016. Unshackled from the cartel’s restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output. A reduction in the official selling prices, or OSPs, suggests the Saudis are looking to do just that. 
Oil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out
Stocks fall most since financial crisis, oil plunges most since Gulf War. Here’s a look at the damage
“It’s certainly a high-risk, high-stakes approach,” Tim Fox, chief economist at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC, said Sunday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It will be a question of who blinks first.”Aramco’s pricing decision affects about 14 million barrels a day of oil exports, as other producers in the Persian Gulf region follow its lead in setting prices for their own shipments. Every month, the Gulf’s biggest producers announce the official selling price for their crude grades as a differential — a premium or discount — against regional benchmarks. The changes are usually measured in cents and, at most, a couple of dollars.The state producer lowered April pricing for crude sales to Asia by US$4 to US$6 a barrel and to the U.S. by US$7 a barrel, it said in a pricing announcement emailed Saturday just before midnight Saudi time. Aramco didn’t immediately comment on the strategy behind such deep reductions in pricing.With the coronavirus eroding demand, pushing Brent crude down about 20 per cent so far this year heading into the meeting on Friday, the Saudis had hoped to shore up prices. Brent fell further after Russia balked at OPEC’s plan, closing the week down more than 30 per cent for the year.Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by US$6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company’s pricing sheet.Aramco sells most of its crude in Asia, a region that — until the virus outbreak in China — had served as the driver for global growth in energy demand.The company lowered pricing to northwest Europe and to the Mediterranean region by between $6 and $8 a barrel. Aramco made its biggest cut for crude to northwest Europe, where an $8 a barrel reduction in most grades amounts to a direct challenge to Russia, which sells a large chunk of its flagship Urals crude in the same region. Aramco will sell Arab Light at an unprecedented $10.25 a barrel discount to Brent in Europe.The world’s biggest oil exporter had expected to announce its pricing on Thursday but delayed the decision until after the meeting on Friday between the OPEC and allies including Russia. The postponement marked the first time in at least a decade that Aramco missed its pricing schedule. It typically announces pricing for its crude on the fifth day of each month. Bloomberg.com"

All of the gains were concentrated in full-time work and the private sector.At the same time, the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to a still low 5.6 per cent in the month, from 5.5 per cent in January. Annual wage gains decelerated slightly to 4.3 per cent from 4.4 per cent in the prior month. Hours worked rose 2.3 per cent on the year and 1.2 per cent on the month.The relatively solid report comes amid virus-related turmoil that has gripped markets in the past couple of weeks. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada acted to safeguard the economy against heightening virus concerns by lowering interest rates by 50 basis points to stimulate consumption. The move was part of a broader easing trend among global central banks.Key InsightsA third month of a decent jobs gains backs up the view from the Bank of Canada that the labor market remains a bright spot in the domestic economy even while business investment, productivity and exports remain weak. However, as coronavirus concerns intensified at the end of February and into March, there’s a good chance the labor market will weaken in the coming months if business and consumer confidence weaken further The February report may not reflect the full extent of the virus-related slowdown, given it’s based on a household survey only for the week of Feb. 9 to Feb. 15, which is before the height of the turmoil in global markets. While the data is generally healthy, the gains of recent months aren’t likely to last if coronavirus concerns continue to seep into broader consumer and business confidence The report showed a moderate gain in employment but still reflects a deceleration in job growth from the monster employment gains seen in the first half of 2020 Get MoreBritish Columbia and Ontario posted the biggest job losses; they also saw the unemployment rate rise notably as more people searched for work, the report stated Quebec posted notable job gains of 20,000 continuing a trend of solid growth in employment in the province for several months, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent, the lowest since at least 1976. Gains were mostly among young people aged 15 to 24, the agency said Rail blockades during February caused layoffs within the transportation sector but these were not evident from the data in the report; however, the teacher’s strike in Ontario in February did result in reduced hours worked for the educational services sector The majority of job gains were concentrated in the services-producing sector which rose 24,600; the goods-producing sector added 5,600 jobs All of the job gains in February were concentrated among full-time work and the private sector; the public-sector shed 600 jobs and part-time employment declined by 7,300 jobs With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"

Wednesday’s cut marked a reversal for Poloz, who had been one of the few central bankers over the past year to resist lowering borrowing costs — in part because of concern cuts would fuel the nation’s high household debt levels. However, downside risks to the economy are now “more than sufficient” to outweigh continuing concern about financial vulnerabilities from cheaper money, the governor said.In fact, he flipped the argument on its head — as he had done in his last rate cut in 2015 — arguing the move may actually improve financial stability.“Indeed, declining consumer confidence would naturally lead to reduced activity in the housing market,” he said. “In this context, lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market, rather than contribute to forth.”Lower interest rates will actually help to stabilize the housing market, rather than contribute to forthStephen Poloz 
 
In the decision Wednesday, officials said the virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some regions, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions. Poloz Thursday put much of the emphasis on a major unknown: the impact the crisis could have on broader confidence levels.“It is possible that the global economy will snap back quickly after the health professionals have managed the situation and conditions have returned to normal,” Poloz said. “However, the outbreak and its effects could be more persistent. Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently.”Poloz’s speech is what the central bank calls its Economic Progress Report, in which it aims to provide insight into deliberations following the rate decisions that aren’t accompanied by new forecasts. Poloz will give a press conference at 2:15 p.m.Poloz reiterated much of the language from Wednesday’s statement, including that the central bank is prepared to “adjust” monetary policy further if necessary.Bloomberg.com"

Uncertainty will remain high as long as the outbreak duration is unknown, she said.“It is, unfortunately, spreading undetected more than initially was thought,” Georgieva said. “The moment it became clear it is no more just about China and maybe a small number of countries in Asia surrounding China, then the outlook on what the impact could be changed.”

Georgieva said that the IMF is making available US$50 billion to help countries deal with the virus, including $10 billion at zero interest for the poorest nations. Countries can draw on that money if they need it, she said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.The shift comes as governments and central banks step up emergency actions to protect against greater economic damage and financial-market instability, with the Bank of Canada on Wednesday joining the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates by a half point. Global infections have topped 93,000, resulting in more than 3,200 deaths since the virus originated in Wuhan, China.Georgieva said the virus demands a global response as it affects significant elements of both supply and demand, and IMF member nations are committed to coordinated action. She said that the IMF is confident that global growth this year will be slower than 2019, when growth was 2.9 per cent. The IMF had previously seen 2020 growth accelerating to 3.3 per cent.Malpass, who on Tuesday announced a US$12 billion immediate support package to help poorer countries confront the health and economic impacts from the spread of coronavirus, said 12 countries have so far expressed interest in participating. The speed and breadth of the response will be crucial to its success, he said at the briefing.On Monday, the Washington-based organizations pledged in a joint statement to use “available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance” to aid member countries as they respond to the virus.Georgieva also said Wednesday that the IMF has conducted a dry run for the virtual format that will be used to convene their spring meetings next month with the World Bank instead of holding the conference in Washington.Bloomberg.com"

The legal proposal is the cornerstone of the bloc’s Green Deal, a far-reaching strategy that foresees a radical overhaul of the European economy over the next three decades.“The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future,” von der Leyen said in a statement. “It offers predictability and transparency for European industry and investors. And it gives direction to our green growth strategy and guarantees that the transition will be gradual and fair.”

Canada’s big banks are going green — but they’re lending more and more money to the oil industry
The draft measure proposes a binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without setting intermediate targets at this stage. That triggered criticism of the law by environmental activists, including Greta Thunberg, who called the law “surrender” because it doesn’t ensure more rapid action.The scolding highlights the challenges policy makers face as they seek to balance business interests with the ambitions of an ever-growing green movement. Fighting climate change has catapulted to the top of the EU’s agenda, with 93 per cent of Europeans seeing global warming as a serious problem.The Green Deal was designed to appease these concerns and become a new growth strategy for the 27-nation bloc. But regulatory proposals by the EU’s executive arm are subject to approval by member states, and the climate law reflects the need to seek a compromise between competing national positions. With differing energy mixes, wealth and industrial strength, EU governments are set to wrangle over every bit of the climate strategy and the draft law that will set the basis for the clean-up.However, the dynamics may change with the draft measure. It will pave the way for a new regulatory track where measures to cut emissions avoid a veto by a single country, a tool that was used several times by coal-dependent Poland to halt ambitious policies.Once approved by national governments and the European Parliament, the climate law will start a regulatory frenzy. Everything from energy production to agriculture and the design of cities will be overhauled under the Green Deal strategy that von der Leyen has described as a moonshot.“I’m excited by this,” said Peter Vis, senior adviser at Rud Pedersen Public Affairs in Brussels. “Von der Leyen is setting the ambition without knowing how we will get there. But when Kennedy committed to putting a man on the moon he also wouldn’t know if that is possible.”Here are the main elements of the draft law:EU-wide emissions and removals of greenhouse gases must be balanced by 2050 at the latest Member states must take necessary steps to enable collective achievement of the goal by the EU Commission will review the current 2030 emission-reduction goal by September, exploring options for a new goal of 50%-55% By June 2021, commission will assess how to amend various rules on emissions, including a law on the bloc’s carbon market By September 2023, the commission will every five years assess the progress made by member states following global stock-takes under the Paris Agreement to protect the climate Commission may propose new climate targets every five years following the assessments; trajectory to get to climate neutrality will start with the goal for 2030 The EU executive is also seeking more powers to make sure the bloc delivers on the net-zero emissions goal, making it more difficult for governments and the EU Parliament to object to intermediate targets. It wants to regulate those goals via measures known as delegated acts. To oppose them, a qualified majority of votes is needed in the Council of the EU, which represents member states, and a majority in the Parliament.“Enshrining the climate neutrality goal into law is a crucial and welcome step,” said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch lobby in Brussels. “However, the climate law’s success will be determined by how it translates into short-term climate action. Europe faces an existential climate crisis and every year matters to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.”The biggest challenge for Europe will be to secure investment for the environmental clean-up. The costs are dizzying: to reach the existing 2030 goal Europe needs investment of 260 billion euros (US$290 billion) annually.Earlier this year, the commission proposed a 1 trillion-euro plan designed to be the financing pillar of the Green Deal. It envisions earmarking around 500 billion euros from the EU budget for the clean shift over the next decade, while separately leveraging 280 billion euros of private and public investment and establishing a funding mechanism with another 143 billion euros, also from public and private sources, to help regions facing the most costly clean-ups.To ensure the Green Deal materializes to be Europe’s new growth strategy, new markets must be developed, with both public and private finance flowing to small and large companies alike to help them deploy first new technologies, according to director general of the chemical industry association Cefic.“The proposal for a climate law is an important first step to achieve investor confidence, which is crucial,” Mensink said. “It is a start of an important journey; our sector must go through a deep transformation, within only one or two investment cycles, for which we need enabling conditions. Therefore, much more is needed.”Bloomberg.com"

Bank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a “significant interruption” to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past — a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus — have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added.

That is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.“The coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,” he said. “And then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.”1990s ReplayPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm’s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil — the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 — forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?“The very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you’re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who’s doing the exact same thing,” he said.Missing SignalsFor Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is “so much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,” he said. “I don’t believe that the bond market’s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.”One of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world’s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.“Inventory’s already low and more importantly there’s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Treasury 10-year yields hovered around 1 per cent after breaching that level on Tuesday for the first time in 150 years.Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rebounded from tumbles on Tuesday, when the 50 basis-point Fed move failed to ease concerns about an economic downturn. Moderate Joe Biden’s surprise comeback hours later in the Super Tuesday race for the Democratic Party nominee took the lead from Bernie Sanders that had unsettled some investors. The Stoxx Europe 600 erased early declines, with utilities and miners leading the advance and all 19 industry sectors in the green.A volatile session in Asia left stock markets mixed. Hong Kong and China PMI data fell to record lows, underlining impacts of the virus on the region’s commerce. The euro dipped after posting its best four-day rally since January 2018. Crude oil gained for a third day.Investors are anxious for promised policy moves by the Group of Seven to confront the virus while they’re tempted to buy on dips in risk assets, all while the world’s biggest bond market gradually moves closer to negative yields. The Democratic leadership contest threw up a fresh challenge to President Donald Trump as Biden, positioned as a moderate against a more progressive Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump in November, won nine of 14 states as results rolled in.“The magnitude of the market sell-off and the rapid policy reaction encouraged us to recently add to our risk positions” through additional exposure to U.S. high-yield credit versus high-quality bonds, Mark Haefele, UBS Wealth Management’s global chief investment officer, wrote in a note. “Where appropriate, we also advocate options strategies to increase exposure to U.S. equities.”Equities earlier had tumbled after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the virus outbreak will weigh on activity “for some time.” Expectations the Fed may act again as soon as this month show markets remain extremely cautious about the economy’s prospects to weather the hit. Meanwhile, virus infections and deaths continued to rise in China and the U.S.“They’re pushing on a string,” said veteran emerging-markets investor Mark Mobius in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The problem is not so much interest rates, which are already very low globally. The problem is the supply chain coming out of China.” Markets will worsen “unless China can ramp up production,” he said.These are the main moves in markets:StocksThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 1.8 per cent as of 7:20 a.m. New York time.

February sales were up by about 15 per cent compared to January.“Sales growth will be strong this year,” board President Michael Collins said in a statement. However, the annual pace of sales will likely slow as stronger sales came into effect after the first quarter of 2019.The average sale price for a detached home in central Toronto was $1,184,800 in February, up 8.1 per cent from a year earlier. Condo prices rose 11 per cent to $609,200 on average downtown.

Powell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said “we do like our current policy stance,” before repeating the Fed’s reference to taking action if needed.G7 CoordinationThe Fed’s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would “use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.”The vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the “fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.”The decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today’s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed “must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.”The Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2020U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday’s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.Clarida StanceAs recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to “act as appropriate,” which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they’re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.No Silver BulletOne lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries — known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is “carrying the domestic burden and the global burden” because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. “The fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.”With assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"

A confluence of factors is priming the pump for a brisk buying season. Lower bond yields amid the virus have allowed Canadian banks to unveil mortgage specials and the government has tweaked its mortgage qualification rules. Meanwhile, markets have begun to price in an interest rate cut from the Bank of Canada to cushion the economic of virus as soon as Wednesday — maybe even 50 basis points.“All of this is great news for housing and the mortgage market — until and unless we see a huge spike in coronavirus cases in Canada and/or a big jump in unemployment,” Robert McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com, said in an interview. “Lower rates are stimulative to housing.”Home prices in some of Canada’s largest cities have already been rebounding after the market slumped through 2018 and 2019. Shrinking supply in Toronto drove prices to their strongest gains in more than two years in January. Pasalis estimates that sales were more than 40 per cent higher in February from a year ago.Yield Freefall“We’re back to near all-time highs in some markets, and we’re seeing prices ramp up and bidding wars in hot markets,” McLister said. “Everyone knows exactly what happens in the near term if mortgage rates plunge — that’s just more kerosene on the fire.”Royal Bank of Canada cut some mortgage rates at the end of January and HSBC Holdings Plc’s Canadian division began offering a three-year fixed-rate mortgage special of 1.99 per cent on Monday while lowering its five-year fixed rate for uninsured mortgages by 30 basis points to 2.49 per cent.“This freefall in yields has been stunning — you don’t see this often — and it’s now just starting to translate into meaningful discounting in mortgage rates,” McLister said.Jonathan Bundle, head of mortgages and secured lending at HSBC Bank Canada, anticipates more competition on mortgages ahead.“There’s indication that it’ll be a strong property market this year and because of that you are going to see that a lot of lenders will end up being competitive,” he said.Vancouver AffectedStill, some realtors have reported some early impacts on activity in cities like Vancouver as the coronavirus outbreak in China cut travel demand in the first two months of the year.“Since they’re not coming here for vacation for Chinese New Year, it’s pretty hard for them to make a decision on any property,” Vancouver realtor Jerry Huang said in an interview. “People were planning to do open houses early February and obviously the turnout wasn’t as good because there’s just a lot less traffic.”He estimated a drop of “50 per cent plus” of overseas buyers, especially from Asia, who were going to visit Vancouver for real-estate projects and deals that just didn’t come.Out of BalanceOther buyers look to have been making up for that. Vancouver home sales surged 45 per cent in February from the year before and prices rose 0.3 per cent, according to data released Tuesday from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Kevin Wang, real estate adviser and property manager at W Brothers Real Estate Group in Vancouver, said longer term, buyers from China may have more of an incentive to buy in Canada to avoid future virus outbreaks.The market is so far out of balance that you could lose half the sales and it'd still be really, really busyJohn Pasalis, Realosophy Realty

Some billionaires, bankers and other members of the U.S. elite are calm, others are getting anxious and everyone is washing their hands. But the rich can afford to prepare for a pandemic with perquisites, like private plane rides out of town, calls with world-leading experts and access to luxurious medical care.“It’s been a full-on war-room situation over here,” said Jordan Shlain, an internist and managing partner of Private Medical, a high-end concierge service.

They just want to know.”Confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide have passed 88,000, and more than 2,900 people have died. The World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment for the illness to “very high.” Fear over the economic fallout has upended global markets, plunging Treasury yields to all-time lows and giving the S&P 500 index its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.One co-founder of a major hedge fund, who asked not to be named discussing his plans, said he’d run in the other direction if his peers start fleeing into doomsday bunkers. He might fly to a house he has in Italy, a country that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises Americans to avoid.

In an emergency statement, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will “strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets.” The Bank of England followed by saying it’s working with U.K. and international authorities to “ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.” Already on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to cutting interest rates to contain what he called the “evolving risks” to economic growth from the virus.

Coronavirus to knock U.S. earnings growth to zero, Goldman says
Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.“Global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. “We suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.”With interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.“Central banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, ” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.Japan to IndonesiaThe Bank of Japan backed up Monday’s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia’s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan’s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan’s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed’s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn’t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde’s comments of last week.“We are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,” Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Less Effective?Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closed 
 
For central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That’s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world’s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won’t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they’re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004.

"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Richard Clough and Rachel Layne,"Jack Welch, ‘manager of the century’ who reshaped GE, dies at 84",Led the industrial conglomerate for two decades,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/jack-welch-former-ge-veteran-dies-cnbc,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jack-welch.jpg,"March 2, 2020 9:33 AM EST","Jack Welch, the champion of corporate efficiency who built General Electric Co. into one of the world’s largest companies and influenced generations of business leaders, has died. He was 84.His death was reported Monday by CNBC, which cited his wife, Suzy.The former GE chairman and chief executive officer, whose blunt style and ceaseless cost cutting earned him the sobriquet “Neutron Jack,” mentored proteges who went on to run some of the world’s best-known companies. Named “Manager of the Century” by Fortune magazine in 1999, he presided over a stock surge of almost 3,000 per cent during a two-decade tenure.“He became the gold standard of greatness, the icon of industrial imagination,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University business professor who knew Welch since the 1980s. “His track record over those 20 years as CEO is hard to see excelled anywhere.”Known simply as Jack to even low-level employees, Welch became the youngest CEO in GE’s history in 1981. He created a leaner company, yet one whose dependence on finance would eventually prove to be a threat. Along the way, he molded GE’s culture to reflect his demanding personality, one larger than his 5-foot-7-inch (1.7-meter) frame.“I like challenging people. I like debate. I like all those things,” he told interviewer Charlie Rose less than two months after his 2001 retirement. “And yet I love having a drink with ’em, too.”Second CareerWelch stepped down four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He remained active for more than a decade as a consultant and media commentator.Business leaders extolled his ability to boost profit and shareholder wealth with his restless, results-driven approach. GE became the world’s biggest company by market value at more than $500 billion in 1999.Imitators across corporate America copied his leadership strategies, and recruiters snapped up lieutenants including W. James McNerney Jr., who later became Boeing Co.’s CEO, and Robert Nardelli, who ran Home Depot Inc. and Chrysler. Another GE executive, Jeffrey Immelt, would best them to succeed Welch.Welch’s legacy was dented in retirement, as GE’s stock lost a third of its value within a year. The shares would lag behind the pre-Sept. 11 level for virtually all of Immelt’s 16 years as CEO.Soon after Enron Corp. collapsed in late 2001, GE found itself facing accounting questions about whether Welch relied on moves such as one-time asset sales to produce consistently steady profit gains. GE Capital under Welch grew so vast that unit’s struggles in the 2008-2009 financial crisis would imperil all of GE. The company has since exited nearly all of the lending businesses.Finance Revisited“There’s been some revisiting of the robustness of the financial services model. GE Capital was providing cover for some other parts of the business,” Sonnenfeld said. There was a “backlash that did dog Jack Welch.”John Francis Welch Jr. was born Nov. 19, 1935, in Peabody, Massachusetts. He was the only child of John Sr., a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor, and Grace Andrews Welch.Growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, he was outspoken and athletic. He played golf, hockey and baseball at Salem High School, where he was voted “most talkative and noisiest” boy by classmates and wrote in the school literary magazine that he wanted to “make a million.” Welch’s mother infused him with self-confidence and helped him overcome a boyhood stutter — “the most influential person in my life,” he wrote in his 2001 autobiography “Jack: Straight From the Gut.”‘You Punk!’After a close hockey defeat as a youngster, Welch flung his stick across the ice, prompting his mother to march into the locker room, grab him by the jersey and shout: “You punk! If you don’t know how to lose, you’ll never know how to win.”In 1957, he graduated with honours from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst with a bachelor’s degree in engineering. Three years later, he received a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois and took a $10,500-a-year job with GE in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the company developed new businesses in plastics.Working his way through the ranks from vice president to vice chairman, Welch gained a reputation as a maverick, questioning whether GE was being run the right way. He saw GE’s future in plastics, medical equipment and financial services, not household appliances.Winners, LosersAt 45, Welch succeeded Reginald Jones as chairman and CEO. While GE was profitable, Welch was concerned that it was too big to be flexible. He sorted GE’s divisions into “winners” — those first or second in their industries — and “losers,” mostly older units that had to improve or face disposal.Over a five-year span in the 1980s, he sold more than 200 businesses and closed dozens of factories. Annual dismissals of the 10 percent of employees deemed the lowest performers also became standard. Welch’s moves would shrink the workforce by one-third to 239,000 people.“A successful leader can shock an organization and lead its recovery. An unsuccessful leader will shock an organization and paralyze it,” Welch said in a 1994 Industry Week interview. “Organizations constantly need to be regenerated.”GE under Welch spent more than $25 billion on acquisitions, and he pushed into finance as the U.S. economy shifted away from manufacturing. He looked overseas, too, boosting foreign sales by more than 50 per cent.He pioneered widely imitated training programs, including “Work-Out,” in which employees learned to accelerate decision-making with days of brainstorming. In 1995, Welch implemented the Six Sigma quality controls to improve manufacturing processes. Noting GE’s success, companies around the world would adopt a similar methodology.‘Tremendous Passion’Welch knew thousands of employees by name and would send handwritten notes to voice his approval or dissatisfaction.“He had tremendous, tremendous passion for the business, but he also had tremendous passion for people,” William Conaty, whose 40-year GE career included serving as human resources chief under Welch, said in a 2014 interview. “If your wife was sick, he’d want to know how she was doing.”Welch also worked six days a week, taking only Sunday off to golf — he called working weekends “a blast” — and expected similar dedication from those who wanted to get ahead. “I never once asked anyone, ‘Is there someplace you would rather be — or need to be — for your family or favourite hobby or whatever?”’ he said in his 2005 book, “Winning.”Welch delayed his mandatory age-65 retirement for almost a year for a final challenge: a US$53 billion bid for Honeywell International Inc. that collapsed when he balked at European regulators’ demands for concessions.Baseball, GolfA lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, Welch would test executives and potential hires on their baseball knowledge. He was also a golf addict, hitting the links with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and executives including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.After leaving GE, Welch served as a part-time adviser, a partner at investment firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice and consultant to companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s business school, opened a management institute bearing his name and stayed in the public eye with guest-host gigs on CNBC and New England Sports Network.Welch married Carolyn Osburn in 1959, and they had four children before divorcing in 1987. He was married to corporate lawyer Jane Beasley for 13 years. They divorced in 2002 amid revelations of an affair with Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer that began when Wetlaufer was interviewing him for an article.The two married in 2004 and went on to collaborate on “Winning,” but not before divorce proceedings opened a public argument over Welch’s fortune, with his second wife’s lawyers claiming his asset valuation of US$456 million was at least $100 million too low. The case was settled in 2003.By then, Welch’s retirement package had been shown to include his US$11 million Central Park West apartment in New York City, use of a private jet, a leased Mercedes-Benz, restaurant and laundry expenses, country-club fees and sports tickets. He later opted to pay for some perks himself.With assistance from Heather Burke.Bloomberg.com"

Canada’s largest stock index flirted with correction territory after plunging for a sixth-straight day, capping off its worst week since the global financial crisis of 2008.The S&P/TSX composite index was down as much as 821 points Friday and closed down 454.39 points at 16,263.05.Treasury yields plunged to all-time lows, with the two-year sinking 15 basis points to 0.90 per cent.

While it probably doesn’t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it’s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week — and that’s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox’s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It’s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox’s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it’s a pretty dry business.

Market panics like this one can be fertile ground for ‘bottom-up’ investors
Chance of Canadian supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus high: RBC
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China’s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now threaten the U.S. If that’s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. “So far we’re not seeing an uptick,” Clorox CEO Benno Dorer said during the company’s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But “we’re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,” he said. It’s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox’s stock is already quite expensive, and it’s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their “sell” ratings on the stock after Clorox’s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company’s other product lines — bags and charcoal —continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn’t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it’s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division “grilling” to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn’t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox’s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it’s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt’s Bees lip care.)With this week’s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak. Clorox may play its own crucial role in combating the disease, but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"

The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.Exchanges operated by TMX stopped trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time. Major U.S. benchmarks dropped more than 4 per cent after falling sharply in the last hour of trading.TMX Group will be left with a “black eye,” Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Securities Ltd. and chairman of the rival Canadian Securities Exchange, said in a phone interview. “It’s a terrible thing to happen, particularly in a cataclysmic market that we’re currently experiencing this week that people either want to trade, need to trade, want to get out or want to get in.”Toronto-based TMX had said in a series of tweets that clients were not able to enter, modify or cancel any open orders on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture and TSX Alpha exchanges. At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives. The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group’s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.“I don’t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,” said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. “Volume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,” Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues “but it’s not impossible to trade,” she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. “Rest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,” he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission. TMX will likely be asked what measures are being put in place so it doesn’t happen again, he added. Bloomberg.com"

‘Rock stars’ of construction in high demand in Toronto, North America’s fastest growing city
Easier mortgage rules won’t fix Canada’s housing crisis
Stress test tinkering comes amid falling mortgage rates and surge in private lending
Royal Bank’s push comes as a rebound in housing takes hold. Home prices in some of Canada’s largest cities including Toronto have recently climbed to records amid a shortage of properties for sale. Including lenders outside the big banks, the nation’s mortgage market in December expanded 4.9 per cent from a year earlier to $1.63 trillion, Bank of Canada monthly data show. That marked a rebound from February 2019, when growth was the paltriest in 18 years.Royal Bank has pulled further ahead of competitors including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal, and even extended its lead over Bank of Nova Scotia, which has been No. 2 in mortgage growth since the latter half of 2018. At Scotiabank, mortgage balances rose 5.3 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in two years.Royal Bank is the country’s largest mortgage lender, based on an average balance of $271.8 billion in the first quarter.“We are bringing a broader spectrum of advice and solutions to our clients, and when we do that we expect to continue to increase market share,” Bolger said, adding that Royal Bank is wooing customers with internet-based tools including OJO Home, an artificial intelligence-powered property search for Greater Toronto, and MoveSnap, an online concierge service for moving-related tasks.Homebuying SeasonThe mortgage-growth revival comes as the government tweaks loan-qualification “stress test” criteria and the spring homebuying season approaches. Bank executives, who have spent recent years dealing with the risks of an overheated housing market, are largely shrugging off such concerns this time around.“Sales activity has been solid, price performance is generally up in the market and it doesn’t feel overly frothy,” Bank of Montreal CFO Tom Flynn said in a phone interview this week.At Flynn’s bank, the domestic mortgage book rose 2.9 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2017, in what he said was a reflection of healthy market conditions.Toronto-Dominion’s domestic mortgage balances rose 3.5 per cent in the first quarter, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2016.“Definitely the volume of transactions in the market do seem to be picking up and the market does seem to be active again,” Toronto-Dominion CFO Riaz Ahmed said in an interview, adding that he expects “mid-single-digit” growth rate in Canadian mortgage volumes for the rest of the year.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, once the market leader for mortgage growth, increased home-loan balances by just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter after seeing its book contract for most of last year. Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig promised improved growth by the end of the year as momentum builds.“Our goal is to be closer to market from a growth perspective,” CFO Hratch Panossian said in an interview. “We’re on track with that.”Bloomberg.com"

They will be ramping up cleaning and disinfection of things people touch: from door handles, to microphones, to touchscreens.That said, most exhibitors from China were forced to pull out because of international travel restrictions, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. “Others are attempting to make alternative arrangements,” Kristy Kenny said by email. “‘At this time, cancellations by individuals and companies have been minimal.”The virus continues to spread beyond its epicentre of China with more than 82,400 cases globally and 2,800 deaths.

Close to 26,000 people attended last year’s conference, which PDAC says injects more than US$70 million into the local economy.With gold prices at a seven year high, and miners awash with cash, the 2020 event was shaping up to be a good one.

Corporate executives are only beginning to get a handle on the damage, and much will depend on how quickly the virus can be brought under control so that normal trade and travel can resume. Here are thoughts so far from Canadian companies doing business overseas.Nutrien Ltd.Chuck Magro, chief executive officer of the world’s largest supplier of crop nutrients, is watching the impact of the coronavirus “hour by hour.” The biggest effects so far have been on potash, he said.“We believe that the contract negotiations will move now from the first quarter to the second quarter and that’s simply because most of the buying committee, large organizations are working from home,” he said at an industry conference Wednesday. “Our sales organizations in China are working from home. They’re not meeting.”

Potash is stuck at its China port because the supply chain is down, he said.“Just a couple of days ago the Chinese government authorized for the first time in five years the use of strategic reserves in potash. We interpret that as an indication that China is worried they don’t have enough potash for the spring season.”In the long run, that will be good for the potash industry as reserves will need to be restored, he said. Agriculture is not correlated to economic growth, he added. “The old adage that people need to eat still holds.”Teck Resources Ltd.Bad weather, blockades, and the virus created “the perfect storm” for the Vancouver-based producer of coal, copper and zinc and Canada’s largest railway customer, CEO Don Lindsay said.“Commodity prices were negatively impacted by global economic uncertainty in 2019. This has continued into 2020,” he told analysts on Feb. 21. “There were some signs of improvement in December and early January with an agreement on a U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal but then the coronavirus emerged and the full impact of the virus is still unknown.”Before the virus, Lindsay said, the company’s plan was to sell at least one asset this year, possibly using the capital for share buybacks. “With coronavirus still prevailing, I think most people are going to…wait and see how that shakes out. It’s still unknown what the long-term effect is, not just the disease itself,” he said.The miner’s shares are down 39 per cent this year.Lululemon Athletica Inc.Most of Lululemon’s 38 stores in China remain closed since first shutting down due to the virus on Feb. 3., though some are coming back on a reduced schedule, CEO Calvin McDonald said.“The safety of our people is our highest priority, and we are adjusting store operations based upon the recommendations of local authorities,” McDonald said in a statement on Feb. 21.

The Vancouver-based company’s US$1-billion international sales opportunity is being led by China, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “China’s performance- and sports-inspired apparel market is worth almost US$87 billion, and management aims to connect with 400 million active millennials,” analysts Poonam Goyal and Abigail Gilmartin said in a report.McDonald said he remained confident in the long-term opportunities in China. The company will provide an update on the impact in its earnings report for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 2. That call is expected next month.Lobster Council of CanadaThe number of cargo planes flying into Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Moncton, New Brunswick, to be loaded with lobster bound for China has dwindled, said Geoff Irvine, executive director of the industry group. While the airports would typically see about nine charter flights a week, that has dropped to one a week in the past month, he said.China has become Canada’s second-biggest export market for live, processed and frozen lobster next to the U.S. While February is typically a slower month for sales, lobster companies are storing the additional unsold inventory or sending it to be processed, Irvine said.

“The Chinese in general are not going out to eat so they’re not consuming lobster in restaurants,” Irvine said by phone. “That’s hopefully going to change as they go back to work and the quarantines end.”Canada shipped more than $450 million (US$337 million) worth of live lobster to China in 2019, according to Statistics Canada data.Barrick Gold Corp.Barrick is benefiting from its experience with highly contagious diseases such as Ebola to help it deal with the coronavirus, CEO Mark Bristow said in comments following a Bloomberg TV interview at a conference Feb. 24.In addition to expanding its health checks across the entire organization, Barrick is increasing supplies of raw materials such as cyanide and cement at its mines, Bristow said. The company will have three to four months worth of those “consumables” on hand, compared with the one-and-a-half months it normally keeps, he said.“The thing about these epidemics is that you have to respond before they hit you,” Bristow said. “We have an emergency action plan.”Bloomberg.com"

Now, analysts are expecting profits to slow for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost a quarter of companies that have reported earnings results since Jan. 17 have cited or answered questions related to the virus or rail blockades and its potential impact on profits, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Bank of Montreal, said in a report published Wednesday.Belski isn’t so worried. “While the coronavirus Covid-19 and rail blockades suggest a double hit to the Canadian supply chain, our work shows the overall impact is likely to be relatively minor.” Supply disruptions will present near-term earnings risks, but profit growth will rebound down the road, he added.Wild RideMarket turbulence has surged.

His view is based on the expectation that risk aversion will remain high, “dollar bloc” currencies will underperform, and that the Bank of Canada could turn more dovish. Markets are pricing in at least two interest rate cuts from the central bank this year.In fixed income, plunging bond yields boosted gains on government debt while spreads in the corporate bond market increased to their widest since mid-December. That’s another indicator of economic concern. Canada’s 30-year government bond yield fell to a record low after breaching the Aug. 15 floor.“Canadian government bonds offer two important benefits at the moment that are increasingly hard to find in the world today: a AAA credit rating and positive nominal yields,” said Kurt Reiman, chief Canadian investment strategist at Blackrock Inc. “During the latest setback for risk assets, Canadian fixed income has provided important portfolio ballast as interest rates decline — even with interest rates at incredibly low levels.”An aggregate index of Canadian bonds in U.S. dollars returned 1 per cent year to date, compared with a 3 per cent increase for a comparable U.S. benchmark, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes. Yet investors snapped up a Canadian issue by Hydro One Ltd. when first sold earlier this week. The notes are trading below their initial pricing as global credit markets grind to a virtual standstill amid the coronavirus outbreak.For Mark Stacey, times like this should remind investors about the advantage of having a balanced portfolio.“While stocks have sold off aggressively, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite in recent days,” said Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc. “By allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly.”Bloomberg.com"

Toronto is dotted with more cranes than any other North American city, and Tiburcio has bragging rights for operating the tallest one.It gives him a killer view of Lake Ontario from a perch 860 feet (262 metres) up, even higher than the condo towers and office buildings nearby. But he’s not getting paid to enjoy the scenery. He’s doing one of the most critical tasks in construction.

“It can be very stressful, especially on a big job like this,” Tiburcio said on a break from helping to build CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “It’s what gets me up in the morning. Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.”Crane operators have been called the “rock stars” of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeMathew Tiburcio, crane operator 
 
It’s part of a decade-long building boom in North America’s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada’s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He’s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada’s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.

Tiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane’s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He’ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane’s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.“You’ve got many trades that need the crane and you’re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,” said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. “Everybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.”At 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.

Toronto has more cranes than any other city in North America.

But the job hasn’t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who’s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.“He already knows all about tower cranes,” Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio’s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He’s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him. He counts 40 — assurance that work won’t dry up when this current job is done.“There are plenty more projects coming up.”Bloomberg.com"

Last year, Air Canada won the global equity crown among airlines after rising 87 per cent with plans accelerate its global presence in leisure travel with the acquisition of tour operator Transat AT.Revenue from outside Canada grew to 64 per cent of total sales last year from 59 per cent in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About one-fifth of the airline’s capacity is on Pacific routes.In its fourth quarter results last week, Air Canada reported earnings per share that missed the lowest analyst estimate. The airline’s outlook for the year saw first quarter Ebitda come in about C$200 million lower from the prior year, assuming its mainland China and Hong Kong services will fully recover by the third quarter and that the Boeing 737 Max aircraft will gradually return to services in that period.Air Canada still has a positive longer-term outlook despite facing near-term pressure from coronavirus risk, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Kevin Chiang wrote in a report published Tuesday.

Outwardly, of course, it hasn’t been a good week for bulls as worries about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China increase. The Cboe Volatility Index closed Tuesday at 27.85, its highest level since December 2018, when turmoil in Washington and concerns that Federal Reserve policy might be too hawkish sent stocks tumbling, though it fell 5.9 per cent to 26.21 as of 8:20 a.m. in New York on Wednesday. The S&P 500 Index itself has lost 7.2 per cent in the past four days, its worst such performance since Christmas Eve that year.Wu Silverman also notes that some investors have been selling near-the-money put options to fund levered multiples of tail puts.The other big thing she is watching: factor performance, particularly in stocks with positive price momentum and those seen as having relatively low valuations. So far, she sees momentum continuing to do well — which is consensus positioning — but on Feb. 20 she recommended trades like buying call options on the iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund to position for a potential change to value.“If we start to see a rotation here, then it flags a major shift in the market’s concerns for growth,” she said Tuesday.Bloomberg.com"

“We are passionate about the consumer and this acquisition is very much on trend,” Glen Walter, president of North America for Mondelez, said in an interview. “We are very passionate about the on-the-go snack.”Give & Go’s management will hold a minority stake in the Ontario-based company. Its headquarters will remain in Canada and all of its products will continue to be made at their current locations.Indulgent Food GroupThe Give & Go deal reflects a dual strategy for Mondelez, which like other snack makers is building on the popularity of the indulgent food category while also responding to consumer demand for healthier treats, including vegan options.In July, Mondelez acquired a majority interest in Perfect Snacks, a maker of nut-butter based protein bars. Mondelez’s Cadbury business is developing a plant-based version of its flagship Dairy Milk chocolate brand, The Telegraph reported in February.Mondelez should be able to build on solid distribution that Give & Go brands have in North America to accelerate sales, said Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.“This acquisition is a good fit for Mondelez, because it brings a couple of well-known brands into the overall portfolio in categories that complement the company’s core strength in cookies, crackers and chocolate,” Bartashus said.Most of Give & Go sales fall into categories with stronger growth and margin profiles than some parts of Mondelez’s portfolio such as gum and powdered beverages, she said.Entry PointGive & Go’s scale and high single-digit growth will give Mondelez an entry into the bakery and pastries, Wells Fargo & Co. analysts wrote in a note Tuesday.“Over time we think capabilities exist to extend Mondelez’s existing brands into new formats,” they said.Thomas H.

Their cumulative return in 2019 was 273 per cent.It’s early in the year to be tallying gains and losses, but it’s the abrupt reversal of sentiment that’s startling. Investors won’t know the exact cost of the coronavirus, both in human and economic terms, for months. But they know the illness is now spreading fast outside China, and that the headwinds will hit an aging global business cycle and a U.S. equity bull market that has outlasted all others.

“Given where we are in markets, given where we are in the cycle in 10 years, anything that’s negative in markets they’re going to jump,” said Philip Webster, director of European equities at BMO Global Asset Management in London. “Investors shoot first and ask questions later at the moment.”The scorecard reflects those kinds of concerns. Industrial raw materials — the ones most exposed to the business cycle — have been hammered. Shares of companies, particularly in the riskier developing world, have tanked.At the other end of the spectrum, the ultimate safe havens for an economic downturn — gold and Treasuries — are winning in 2020, alongside high-quality American corporate debt. The preference for these dollar-denominated assets has also given wings to the greenback.These are the big survivors of the everything rally. For much of 2019, U.S. bonds and gold rallied on the back of a central bank pivot toward easier policy at the start of the year. Now, expectations that more rate cuts or stimulus will be needed to combat the impact of the coronavirus are further stoking those kinds of bets.“Bond yields have stayed low, stimulus is there, rates are still being held down,” said Webster. “Yes, there’s been a shift out of equities into non-risk assets, but I’m fairly relaxed” about where the portfolio is, he said.Overlaying the Gregorian calendar on asset moves can be deceptive, of course. Any investor or trader whose performance isn’t measured annually may look at the picture very differently. For example, even with the turmoil of the past four trading sessions in U.S. stocks, an investor who bought the S&P 500 Index 12 months ago would still be up 12 per cent through Monday.On Wednesday morning stocks in particular appeared to be making fresh efforts to stabilize. Futures for the benchmark U.S. gauges fluctuated, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index clawed back well over half of its earlier losses. Market players are scrambling to figure out whether the virus will be contained and a V-shaped recovery will ensue, or if the impact will be lengthy leading to more L-shaped economic performance.“It’s a bit early to know which will be the scenario,” said Denis Panel, head of the multi-asset, quantitative and solutions group at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “We’re in a situation where we could increase the risk — the V — or we could reduce the risk and short the market potentially if it’s an L scenario. It’s quite an interesting time.”Bloomberg.com"

The central bank is now actively developing a prototype digital currency, according to a background document.“We need to move forward to work out what a potential CBDC might look like and how it could be managed, if the decision were ever taken to issue one.” Lane said regarding preparations for a potential central bank digital currency in Canada.Central banks around the world are trying to get to grips with emerging payment technologies. Private-sector initiatives such as Facebook Inc.’s Libra are adding urgency to the debate over how digital currencies should be handled.The Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have called for central banks to at least study the possibility of as private sector firms experiment with competing units of exchange.The Bank sees two main scenarios where the central bank could see the need to issue its own digital currency: firstly, if the use of cash is restricted or eliminated, and second, if private cryptocurrencies were to make serious inroads.“In both scenarios, there would be an argument for the Bank of Canada to step in,” said Lane. “The Bank would do this as a trusted public institution, creating an official digital currency that is designed with the interest of the public as its top priority, with no commercial motive.”It isn’t the Bank of Canada’s first foray into the matter — staff have authored several papers on the potential effects of introducing a central bank digital currency, including the possibility of reduced market power of private banks. However, the central bank is shifting to the development of an actual prototype, though it could still be years away from being ready, and will still need a legislative framework.“If one or more alternative digital currencies threatened to become used widely as an alternative to the Canadian dollar”  then a central bank issued digital currency could be used to defend monetary sovereignty, the Bank said. Bloomberg.com"

The oilsands of Alberta have drawn the ire of environmental activists because of the region’s vast open-pit mines that require the clearance of forest, produce massive lakes of wastewater and consume more energy than other ways of extracting oil. Refining the sticky, black bitumen scooped from some mines in so-called upgraders is also very carbon-intensive. Newer, smaller projects, while more efficient, still use a lot of energy to extract the oil with the help of steam.While attempts to make Canada’s oilsands into an economically viable source of crude have been ongoing for about a century, the industry experienced its heyday in the 2000s and 2010s, when fears abounded that the world may be running out of crude.Those fears prompted a flood of global investment as nations and international producers rushed to secure supplies. From 2004 to 2014, about $210.1 billion was invested in the oilsands, according to data from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day, and Canada shot up from the world’s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest.

The industry has struggled since global oil prices crashed from more than US$100 a barrel in mid-2014. New pipeline projects were stalled by environmentalist opposition and legal challenges, weighing on Canadian heavy crude prices. International giants including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips sold off oilsands assets. And capital spending in the oil sands fell for five straight years.The situation came to a head in late 2018, when a wave of new production, the shortage of pipeline space and a heavier-than-normal refinery maintenance season in the U.S. combined to cause a crash in Canadian heavy crude prices. That prompted Alberta’s government to implement mandatory production limits that started in 2019 and may remain in effect for the rest of this year.Teck Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay, in a letter explaining the company’s decision on Frontier, acknowledged the project raised broader questions over climate change and how countries’ regulatory regimes should balance resource development and emissions reductions.“The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,” Lindsay said. “In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.”But the hard economic reality remains the potentially biggest hurdle. Frontier’s 2011 application relied on long-term oil prices over its four-decade life of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven’t seen since 2014. With both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude prices in the US$50-a-barrel range and the U.S.’s Permian Basin continuing to pump more oil, those prices may not return anytime soon.The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolvedDon Lindsay, Teck Resources CEO 
 
“This was the last big oilsands mining project advancing in the oilsands,” said Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets. “Fully new greenfield ones outside this one, I don’t think there is any.”Analysts had generally positive reactions to Teck cancelling Frontier. Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba said that despite the $1.13-billion writedown Teck would take on the project, “it removes overhanging concerns about the company potentially making a significant investment in fossil fuel amid raising ESG focus.”To be sure, the oilsands industry is far from shutting down. Major producers are generally profitable and producing free cash flow. Capital spending is even projected to tick up this year. Producers are continually developing new technologies and finding ways to cut costs.They can still expand existing mines and are able to add output from what are known as in situ projects, which resemble more familiar methods of oil extraction by tapping underground resources through the use of wells. Those tend to be smaller, cheaper and faster to build.But even those projects are having trouble in the current environment.

This comes after criticism that the policy was too tight and unfairly kept younger, first-time buyers out the market.The gap between the old qualifying rate and the new rate is about 30 basis points, which will allow the median household in Canada to buy $13,500 (US$9,800) in extra real estate, according to CIBC’s Benjamin Tal. That equates to less than a 3 per cent improvement in purchasing power, the bank’s deputy chief economist wrote Friday in a note to clients.

Why mortgage stress test changes should not be made in political backrooms
“It’s becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it’s impossible to fight supply issues with demand tools,” Tal said. “Increased supply (rental or otherwise) is the only reasonable solution to the housing affordability crisis that many Canadians are facing.”While the existing qualification rule, introduced in 2016 for insured mortgages and extended in 2018 to the uninsured space, were effective in restoring balance to a market that seemed to be escalating out of control, a rebound in Canadian housing is underway. Home prices in some of the country’s largest cities such as Toronto climbed to fresh records recently, driven higher by dwindling inventories.It's becoming more and more apparent that, short of drastic measures, it's impossible to fight supply issues with demand toolsBenjamin Tal 
 
Tal’s comments were echoed by Neil McLaughlin, group head of personal and commercial banking at Royal Bank of Canada, who said Friday on a conference call with analysts the stress test change will have “quite a minimal impact.”“Our analysis so far looks like it would be about 25 to 30 basis points reduction in the qualifying rate,” McLaughlin said. “That would really translate into a fairly small increase in purchasing power for the average borrower, probably in the neighbourhood of about $20,000, $25,000 on an average mortgage.”He also agrees with Tal on what’s needed to address the affordability issue. “The lack of supply in the major urban markets is still the real focus for where the policy needs to go,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Rejecting the mine would have sparked widespread anger in Alberta, where the mine would have provided jobs and investment; approving it would have alienated the Liberal prime minister’s environmentalist base.

However, Teck pulling the application won’t be an unvarnished win for Trudeau. In a letter explaining why the miner pulled the plug, Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay placed the blame on governments, saying Canada doesn’t yet have a clear framework to reconcile resource development and climate change.“The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,” Lindsay said. “In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.”Beyond the climate-change debate, the economics of the project have changed radically since it was first proposed in 2011. Back then, crude prices often topped US$100 a barrel and fears abounded that the world was running out of oil. Canada’s oilsands, which contain the world’s third-largest reserves, saw a boom of spending as companies and countries rushed to secure supplies.Jobs vs ClimateBut since then, fracking techniques unlocked massive reserves in Texas’s Permian Basin, helping the U.S. surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top oil producer. Teck’s application for the project relied on long-term prices of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven’t reached since 2014. West Texas Intermediate traded below $52 a barrel on Monday.The mine would have produced about 260,000 barrels of crude a day, more than the daily oil consumption of Norway. It also would have emitted the equivalent of about 4.1 million tons of carbon-dioxide a year, making it harder for Canada to meet its greenhouse-gas reduction targets.But for Alberta, which has struggled with the downturn in oil prices since 2014, Frontier would have been a boon, creating a projected 7,000 jobs during construction and as many as 2,500 operating positions during its four-decade life. It also would have contributed about $70 billion to federal, provincial and municipal governments through taxes and royalties.Teck said in its earnings statement Friday that it would need to take an impairment charge if Trudeau rejected the mine. The Liberal caucus was divided on the project and cabinet hadn’t made a decision yet, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Bloomberg.com"

Even that did little to chip away at Berkshire’s cash hoard, and it was still a net seller of stocks in the fourth quarter.Buffett’s letter will be released alongside Berkshire’s annual report, which will include quarterly results for his sprawling company. Operating earnings probably rose in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, according to Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Berkshire’s net-income figure now factors in swings in the US$220-billion stock portfolio, volatility that Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore.As for acquisitions, Buffett for years has stressed patience, with prices for good businesses becoming “sky-high.” Last year, the S&P 500 Index notched its biggest gain since 2013. Waiting for markets to turn might be the wisest course for Buffett, according to Shields.‘Do Nothing’“The right thing to do is to do nothing if the potential acquisitions are overpriced,” Shields said in an interview.As to whether the challenging environment for acquisitions could mean more Berkshire share buybacks in the future, Munger provided no guidance in last week’s interview, following the annual meeting of his Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles.“Who can tell?” he said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Fireworks on the corporate front in conjunction with Berkshire’s announcement of 4Q earnings are unlikely, in our view. Berkshire didn’t make any major acquisitions in the past three months, and share repurchases were probably modest in the quarter.”–Matthew Palazola, senior analystWhile the Oracle of Omaha may address the frustrations of dealmaking and investing in 2019, Buffett often uses the letter as a platform to delve into a wider range of issues too, including the economy, politics and investment fees.Here are some other topics that might come up in the letter:Kraft HeinzOver the past year, a massive writedown, management changes and a regulatory probe at the packaged-food giant caused turmoil for Berkshire, its biggest shareholder. More recently, Kraft Heinz was downgraded to junk by some credit-rating companies, which has weighed on its stock.Following a delay related to the problems at Kraft Heinz, Berkshire’s portion of its earnings are once again included in the conglomerate’s results. Buffett’s company carried its Kraft Heinz stake at a value of US$13.8 billion on its balance sheet at the end of September, almost US$4.7 billion more than the market price at the time. The conglomerate said it’ll continue to monitor the investment for impairment, but didn’t think it was required then.“I have thought they have needed to write down the value of the asset for several quarters now,” Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview. “I am surprised and dismayed that the carrying value has not been reconciled to reality.”GeicoBuffett’s company famously keeps a relatively tight corporate staff, with just 26 employees in the office, so any reshuffling of duties tends to attract investor attention. Late last year, Berkshire named Todd Combs, who helps Buffett oversee investments, to run auto insurer Geico, in addition to his role managing at least US$14 billion in stocks. While Buffett’s deputy worked at Progressive Corp. years ago, most of his career has been spent managing investments.“That was a really surprising appointment,” said Shanahan of Edward Jones. “He just doesn’t have that kind of experience — not only running a large organization, but running an insurance company.”Combs knows a lot about auto insurance so the appointment made sense, according to Munger. The auto insurer will increasingly need to figure out how to navigate changing technology, such as artificial intelligence for underwriting, Munger said.Geico has also been facing pressure from rivals including Progressive, which sparked a question from a shareholder at last year’s annual meeting about how Geico stacked up to its competitor. Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations at Berkshire, said Geico has “significant” advantages in terms of controlling expenses, but that Progressive is better at managing losses.“Geico is very aware of this disadvantage on the loss ratio that they are suffering, and they’re very focused on trying to bridge that gap as quickly as they can,” Jain said at the time.Geico ended up tweaking its strategy last year, building out capabilities long championed by Progressive and Allstate Corp. Geico introduced a telematics offering, which connects cars and phone apps to track drivers’ habits.SuccessionBuffett’s letter always spurs questions about succession for the 89-year-old CEO and his 96-year-old business partner Munger. In 2018, Berkshire appointed two key lieutenants, Jain and Greg Abel, to its board, promotions that Buffett said at the time were movements toward succession.Buffett hasn’t publicly named his successor, a fact that ramps up speculation around any public announcements. Many investors have been focusing on Abel, whose mandate includes overseeing all of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses. Those responsibilities put him in charge of companies from the sprawling energy empire he led for years to retailers Dairy Queen and See’s Candies and apparel brands Fruit of the Loom and Brooks Sports.PoliticsBuffett has been carefully navigating the increasingly bifurcated U.S. political climate in recent years. While he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he has yet to endorse a candidate in this year’s presidential race, though he has expressed support for Michael Bloomberg, who’s seeking the Democratic nomination. (Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Buffett’s 2019 letter contained a carefully worded section on how U.S. prosperity has been achieved in a bipartisan manner. He might take a similar approach this year.“He may say something thinly veiled within the context of the American system and preserving the American system of capitalism,” CFRA’s Seifert said. “He runs a very large, globally interconnected company. It’s probably not a bad idea for him to be measured in what he says.”Bloomberg.com"

Besides a sale, the Caisse’s real-estate unit, Ivanhoe Cambridge, will consider transforming malls with everything from residential housing to logistics space.“Canada had been relatively protected but global trends are accelerating and are hitting us too,” Ivanhoe’s President Nathalie Palladitcheff told reporters Thursday. “When you have 25 shopping centres, it’s a big amount — even if it changes just a little bit, it has a great impact immediately in terms of figures.”

Ivanhoe Cambridge held $39.7-billion (US$29.9 bililion) worth of real estate at the end of 2019, about 12 per cent of the total funds under Caisse management. Its shopping centres include the Eaton Centrein Montreal and Metropolis at Metrotown I and II in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver.“One can’t be satisfied with the 2019 returns,” Palladitcheff said. The division will reduce traditional assets, which she described as malls and offices.The investment shift comes as real-estate funds in the U.S. and Europe struggle to meet a surge in investor requests to get their money back, driven by mounting concerns about the health of malls at a time of rapid growth e-commerce.As store closures and bankruptcies pile up for retailers, malls are trying to find ways to draw foot traffic and keep their properties full of rent-paying tenants.Metrotown illustrates the changing landscape, Palladitcheff said. Five years ago, a contract with Target Corp. was considered the best outcome, she said.“As you well imagine, things have changed,” she said. “Today when we discuss a residential development for Metrotown, we see that is the best possible transaction.”Target closed its Canadian stores in 2015 after losing billions.Bloomberg.com"

The Caisse said its public equities portfolio trailed its own benchmark by slightly less than one percentage point, partly due to its strategy of prioritizing value stocks, which are a longer term play.

Chief executive Charles Emond said the portfolio delivered during a year that saw markets getting “carried away” and seem disconnected from real growth.“We are seeking to build a portfolio that is more diversified, more stable, more reliable, less vulnerable to market moves,” Emond said Thursday at the pension fund’s headquarters in Montreal.Fixed income assets returned 8.9 per cent, as the pension fund increased its exposure to corporate credit, real estate debt, specialty finance and sovereign credit. It’s also investing more in credit assets outside of Canada. Like other asset managers, the pension fund is trying to increase its holdings of higher-yielding private credit, but is doing so slowly because finding and screening companies is labor intensive, head of corporate credit James McMullan said last November.Malls SufferThe Caisse’s real assets portfolio, which includes infrastructure and real estate, was its worst performing asset class, returning 1 per cent. Real estate holdings lost 2.7 per cent. It was affected by the weak performance of Canadian shopping centers, whose valuations are declining as a result of a consumer shift toward e-commerce, and by residential real estate in New York, in light of new regulations to control rent increases.The Caisse manages the pension plan of retirees in Quebec, Canada’s second most populous province, as well as various provincial insurance plans.Its 2019 results trailed the average 14 per cent increase of Canadian defined pension plans, as estimated by RBC Investor Services. The Caisse results were 1.6 per cent below the fund manager’s own benchmark, mostly due to the performance in the real estate and infrastructure portfolios.Still, the pension fund said it has generated $11 billion in value added compared to its benchmark portfolio over five years and more than $18 billion over ten years.

Morgan Stanley also gets E*Trade’s direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities to complement its full-service, advisory-focused brokerage.“Our clients increasingly want digital access and digital banking, and their clients want wealth-management advice,” Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in an interview. “It’s the continuing evolution of Morgan Stanley into a stable, well-diversified business.”In reshaping the firm since the financial crisis, Gorman has been emphasizing Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management powerhouse. Purchasing E*Trade helps him add clients who are less wealthy than its traditional customers. The New York-based company has lost some business to the retail brokerages in recent years as those firms invested heavily in their web platforms.“Wall Street banks continue to covet Main Street customers,” Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate.com, said in an email. The acquisition “gives them access to brokerage customers, employees with company stock, and the lifeblood of financial services — low-cost retail bank deposits.”The retail-brokerage industry is being reshaped by price wars and consolidation. In early October, Charles Schwab Corp. eliminated commissions for U.S. stock trading, spurring other brokerages to follow suit and sweeping away an important revenue stream.The following month, Schwab agreed to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for about US$26 billion and create a mega-firm with US$5 trillion in assets, forcing smaller brokerages like E*Trade to contend with a much more formidable competitor.‘Hefty Price’Stockholders in E*Trade, which posted worse-than-expected earnings last month, will receive 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each of their shares, valued at US$58.74 based on Wednesday’s closing price.“It’s a pretty hefty price,” said Alison Williams, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The deal is consistent with Morgan Stanley’s strategy to dive deeper into the mass-affluent market, she said.Shares of Morgan Stanley slumped 4.1 per cent to US$54.01 at 9:34 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline in six months. E*Trade surged the most in almost 11 years, gaining 24 per cent to US$55.90. Gorman said he expects Morgan Stanley shares to rebound once investors start valuing the stock at a higher multiple over the long term.For Morgan Stanley, the deal “deepens the ‘safe’ wealth-management franchise — rich in fees and stability,” credit analyst David Havens at Imperial Capital wrote in a note to clients. “It reduces reliance on the more mercurial trading and markets businesses.”E*Trade, founded in 1982, was one of the early players in the discount-brokerage industry. Its reach with self-guided traders online gives Morgan Stanley access to a broader customer base, including those who may have less to invest than its current clients.Morgan Stanley will keep the E*Trade brand in some way, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. “It’s something I think you’d be completely nuts to get rid of,” he said, comparing the brand’s worth to how valuable Merrill Lynch is to Bank of America Corp. and the Chase name is for JPMorgan Chase & Co.Long seen as a potential takeover target for the likes of TD Ameritrade, E*Trade was left looking for ways to reinvent its image and lure more customers in the wake of its rival’s merger with Schwab. In a signal that it was on the hunt for acquirers, a January filing boosted compensation for executives in the event of a change in control.JPMorgan served as the lead financial adviser to E*Trade, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was external legal counsel. Bloomberg.com"

The South American nation, which was the world’s first country to legalize most uses of marijuana, has the potential to become a “low cost production centre,” he said.Cannabis companies are entering a consolidation phase, a trend that will winnow the playing field as capital markets prioritize profit over breakneck expansion. Canadian producers like Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Tilray Inc. are cutting jobs to lower costs, and in the U.S. only the biggest cannabis firms have access to capital markets. Some producers are facing cash shortfalls that could put them out of business.

“I think there has been a reality check throughout the industry,” Lewis said in a telephone interview. “The most important thing at the moment is to deliver results. That means making sure you have a sustainable operation in terms of cash flow.”British Columbia-based Silverpeak is in no rush to ask investors for more money after it raised about US$25 million from late 2018 through the end of last year.

“We want to go to the capital markets when the conditions are favourable,” Lewis said. “Right now, the goal is to have the luxury to decide when to go.”Last year, Fotmer shipped just over one metric ton of THC rich dried flower to an EU country, which he declined to identify, and Australia. Lewis sees Australia and the EU as his main export markets in 2020, with Israel emerging as another possible buyer.“We expect to be shipping over 100 kilos a month in the near term. Right now the limiting factor for us is our actual production,” he said.Production LimitFotmer has asked the Uruguayan government to expand its annual production limit to 150 metric tons (330,693 pounds) of dried flowers from 10 tons today.While the international market for THC rich dried flowers is still strong, Lewis said he wants to sell some value-added products such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, creams or tinctures as soon as next year.Fotmer recently shipped dried flowers to California-based Biopharmaceutical Research Company for analysis and profiling that will help the firm demonstrate it can consistently produce certain cannabinoids for medical and non-medical products, he said.Bloomberg.com"

The company has been working with regulators to recertify the 737 Max and end a grounding that began almost a year ago after two fatal accidents killed 346 people.The debris problem — a potential safety hazard — is another embarrassment for Boeing as its new leaders work to reassure airlines, crew members and passengers of the company’s commitment to manufacturing quality and safety. Boeing has struggled with similar quality lapses in other aircraft, including KC-46 aerial refuelers supplied to the U.S. Air Force.

Foreign-object debris “is absolutely unacceptable. One escape is one too many,” Mark Jenks, a Boeing vice president and general manager of the 737 program, said in a message to employees that was viewed by Bloomberg.The Chicago-based planemaker has held meetings with employees to share a new process for stopping debris from winding up in Max frames, Jenks said. The company, which has indefinitely halted Max production, plans to hold additional inspections, audits and checks in its “tank closure process” to ensure that nothing is left within fuel tanks, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration said it had stepped up its supervision because of Boeing’s voluntary checks.“The agency increased its surveillance based on initial inspection reports and will take further action based on the findings,” the FAA said in a statement.Boeing shares were little changed at US$339.05 after the close of regular trading in New York.An inspection of each stored plane takes about three days to be completed, according to Leeham News, which reported earlier that debris had been discovered in some parked Max jets. The aircraft fuel tanks must be drained and fumes dissipated before work can begin.Separately, Stan Deal, the head of Boeing’s jetliner division, named Mike Fleming to the newly created role of vice president of 737 Max Return to Service and Global Aviation Safety System. The appointment is one of the first changes to the senior management team that Deal has made since taking charge of Boeing’s main business in October.Fleming previously was a vice president in charge of commercial services at Boeing Global Services, the division Deal previously ran.He will oversee Boeing’s sprawling campaign to prepare about 800 grounded Max jets to resume flight.

The relatively small investments, which totalled US$25 million across both funds, are Berkshire’s only publicly disclosed ETF holdings in its most recent quarterly 13F filing. The investments are in a pension plan, according to Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek.Buffett, whose Berkshire holds a record US$128 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury bills, has been questioned before about why he didn’t put the firm’s unused cash into an index fund. The 89-year-old investor said last year at his annual shareholder meeting that he thinks Berkshire should have some cash available to quickly deploy if the chance to strike a big acquisition arises, even though he’d rather own an index fund than U.S. Treasury bills. He argued back in 2007 that he thought Berkshire’s stock picks could do better than the S&P 500 Index. Berkshire’s set to release its annual letter to shareholders on Saturday.

The fourth-quarter addition is arguably the “ultimate endorsement” for ETFs and their different usages, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas. Large institutions will often park money in ETFs to keep exposure to the market while minimizing cash drag in their portfolios, he said — which is likely what Berkshire has started to do with its record cash pile.“They use it almost as a temporary parking spot, and I think the liquidity is what they’re attracted to,” Balchunas said.In that scenario, ETFs are essentially being used as an alternative for derivatives contracts, Balchunas said. He estimates that this manner of institutional usage accounts for roughly 5 per cent to 10 per cent of ETF assets.Climbing Cash PileBerkshire has accumulated a more than US$71-billion stake in Apple Inc. in recent years and purchased stock in Kroger Co. and Biogen Inc. during the last three months of 2019.Still, Berkshire’s failed to find a massive acquisition of a company to keep growing the conglomerate in recent years. That’s weighed on Berkshire stock with the Class A shares increasing nearly 11 per cent last year, short of the almost 29 per cent gain in the S&P 500 during the same period.In the meantime, Berkshire is likely using these ETFs as a liquidity way-station of sorts, according to Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s New York-based director of ETF research.“SPY and VOO provide institutional investors the ability to stay in the market, while keeping their options open as they seek out individual stocks,” Rosenbluth said.Bloomberg.com

Bahnsen is a member of a club of well-connected executives, powerful investors and multibillionaires who wanted the White House to take mercy on Milken.Supporters include casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, Apollo Global Management Inc. co-founder Josh Harris, Vornado Realty Trust boss Steven Roth and Carlyle Group Inc.’s David Rubenstein, according to a White House announcement that also cited Bahnsen. He wrote a plea to Trump in 2017 that chalked up Milken’s conviction to “a period of class envy run amok.”Milken’s rise behind an X-shaped desk in Beverly Hills was so sharp that it fuelled the buyout boom and the reign of junk bonds, though his colleagues inside Drexel Burnham Lambert preferred the term high yield. His fall, culminating in 22 months in prison for illegal trades, was so steep that it helped turn him into a symbol for the avarice of an entire industry and era.There isn't anybody in finance who doesn't believe that this is the right thing to doDavid Bahnsen 
 
The 73-year-old billionaire’s rescue by Trump was so astounding that Wall Street observers wondered if he would try to return to the securities industry that banned him for life.“Today, that is the farthest thing from his mind,” a spokesman for Milken wrote in an email. “He’s fully dedicated to continuing his lifelong crusade to cure cancer and other life-threatening diseases.” Another statement added that Milken was “very grateful to the president.”Around the time that Trump was trying to transform himself into a king of 1980s New York real estate, Milken was helping to turn junk bonds from a backwater of risky corporate debt into a trillion-dollar market. Those bonds let a ragtag group of corporate raiders borrow enough to take over some of America’s best-known companies, and Milken inspired Wall Street acolytes who stayed loyal well past Drexel’s bankruptcy — and his tearful apology in court for securities fraud.White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the conviction was based on “truly novel” charges.Milken embraced the spotlight after prison, recasting himself as a philanthropist trying to cure cancer and help children. Some of his projects have included the Milken Family Foundation, Milken Educator Awards, Milken Archive of Jewish Music, Milken Community Schools, Milken Scholars program and the Milken Institute, whose annual conference brings together the world’s most powerful finance figures for mingling, yoga, talk of the future and playtime with puppies.The Beverly Hills gathering is a contemporary version of what was known decades ago as the Predators’ Ball, famous for its cigar smoke, testosterone and talk of takeovers.In 1998, Milken agreed to pay US$47 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission claims he had violated his ban from the industry, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.Fifteen years later, regulators investigated whether he had committed another violation by working with Guggenheim Partners. The firm agreed to pay US$20 million to settle SEC charges that it failed to disclose a US$50-million loan by a client to one of its senior executives. Milken was the client, people familiar with the matter have said.His fans across Wall Street and big business stayed loyal, and he even gained new ones.Trump’s announcement cited Rupert Murdoch, former Facebook Inc. President Sean Parker, Nelson Peltz and hedge fund manager John Paulson. Milken also had backing inside the administration from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Rudy Giuliani, who as federal prosecutor helped send Milken to prison.A few days ago, Bahnsen bumped into Giuliani. “I guess he must not have known,” the executive said. “He didn’t let on at all.”Bloomberg.com

The measure is expected to boost British Columbia’s personal income tax revenue by nearly 7 per cent in the next fiscal year after a projected 3 per cent decline this year, according to budget documents.“It’s my job to make sure that the benefits of B.C.’s strong economy are felt by everyone, not just the few at the top,” British Columbia Finance Minister Carole James said in Victoria. “Today we’re asking the people at the top, the highest 1 per cent of individual income earners, to pay a little more.”British Columbia Premier John Horgan has made affordability a central plank of his government since taking power in 2017.  Research has shown Vancouver — Canada’s priciest housing market — to be one of the continent’s most unaffordable housing markets with San Francisco-like home prices on Omaha-level incomes. In previous years, the provincial government’s measures have included levies targeting foreign buyers, properties left vacant for more than half the year, and a so-called school tax on luxury homes.In Tuesday’s budget announcement, the government forecast its surplus would widen to $227 million in the fiscal year beginning April 1, following a projected $203 million surplus in the year ending March 31. It projects a $179 million surplus in 2021-2022 and another $374 million surplus in 2022-23.British Columbia is expected to remain one of Canada’s fastest-growing provinces, the government said. The fiscal plan pegged economic growth at 2 per cent this year, following a 1.8 per cent expansion in 2019.“We all want to feel the benefits that come with a strong provincial economy,” James said. “We all want life to be more affordable.”The new tax bracket will mostly affect men: some 70 per cent of those set to pay the new top rate are male, the government said. Meanwhile, a rise in the minimum wage to more than $15 an hour by 2021 will disproportionately benefit women, James said. More than half of the province’s 140,000 minimum-wage earners are female, she said.More broadly, however, budget documents show overall wage growth slowing: average weekly wages in B.C. rose 2.5 per cent last year, down from a 4.1 per cent increase in 2018. The projections also indicate wage growth slowing this year and next.Meanwhile, the government’s efforts to drive down property prices have been only moderately successful. The average sale price of a home in British Columbia fell in 2019 by 1.6 per cent, according to budget documents, while housing activity is in an upward trajectory after bottoming out last year, according to TD Economics.Asked if she wants to see sharper declines, James answered, “I do.”Bloomberg.com"

That sent investors to the safety of precious metals including gold and palladium.The rally in metals gathered pace around 10 a.m. as gold advanced above US$1,600 an ounce. Over that full hour, volume for palladium was more than six times the average in the past 100 days for that time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Palladium delivered a 77 per cent return over the past year, the biggest among 45 raw materials on the DCI BNP Paribas Enhanced Index.

“Palladium has been unbelievable — it’s like the Tesla stock of commodities,” Edward Meir, an analyst at ED&F Man Capital Markets, said by phone. “Prices are caught up in the rally in precious metals. Whenever these metals rally palladium tends to move as well, but by a greater magnitude.”Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 7.5 per cent to US$2,489.70 an ounce at 11:45 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after reaching US$2,498.20, the highest on records going back three decades.

The tally of outstanding contracts for the metal more than 30 times the size of palladium.Palladium’s stellar performance has been driven by expectations that stricter Chinese environmental standards will spur higher loadings of the material in cars, draining global supply that’s already struggling to meet demand.Production will trail consumption by 1.9 million ounces this year, wider than the 1.1 million ounce-deficit last year, Anglo American Platinum Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said in a presentation.Bloomberg.com"

Year-to-date, about 30 per cent of the capital raises have been debt compared to 19 per cent a year ago.

“This is a trend with sustainability as debt financing provides a lower cost of capital for operators relative to the dilutive effect of raising equity with weak share prices,” Viridian said in its cannabis deal tracker published Feb. 12.Notably, the number of raises is still tracking below last year’s number, at 36 versus 52. This implies that investors are more selective but also more willing to shell out large amounts of money when they find a prospect they like.This funding is primarily going to public companies as investors seek liquidity in turbulent markets, Viridian said.Arcview FundA new fund from cannabis investment and research firm Arcview Group aims to expand the financing options available to early-stage private companies.Arcview has facilitated investments since its inception in 2010, helping its network of about 600 accredited investors place more than US$270 million in over 200 companies, but this is its first foray into running its own fund.The Arcview Collective Fund will be led by Chief Investment Officer Jeanne Sullivan, a co-founder of tech venture capital firm StarVest Partners, and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Finkle, co-founder of Odeon Capital Partners. They will help to advise the fund’s members, who will vote on its investments.“This is a hybrid between an angel-type gathering and a traditional venture fund whereby the investors are limited partners but they also have general partnership status,” Sullivan said.The fund will start small, targeting about US$10 million in assets under management, and has attracted more than 40 investors to date: “Tech investors, fintech players, senior partners at investment banking firms, several attorneys, private investors and more and more women,” she said.The latter is a key focus for the fund. Three of its six investments so far are in female-run companies, including CBD brand Fleur Marche, California-based Garden Society and Altopa, which makes the Oblend botanical-oil mixing device.Sullivan said the recent collapse in cannabis stocks was “an appropriate correction” and believes some private companies are now undervalued. That said, she also sees founders who are still seeking “out-of-control valuations.”“It’s Darwinian: if they don’t fix that, then they’re not going to win because people will walk away,” she said.Bloomberg.com"

Last year’s drop in Vestas’s market share was the first BNEF recorded since it began keeping the data in its current form in 2014.

After a decade out in the cold, 2020 could be the year of the pipeline
Wind power is likely to generate over a quarter of the world’s electricity by 2050, according to a BNEF forecast. The majority of that will come from onshore wind farms. In 2019, developers installed almost 61 gigawatts of wind turbines worldwide, up 22 per cent from the year prior. This year that number is forecast to jump an additional 24 per cent to 75 gigawatts, analysts at BNEF say.The market for onshore wind power was mostly concentrated in China and the U.S. last year. GE installed about half of all the onshore turbines in the U.S., adding 40 per cent more turbines there than in it did in 2018. A few companies in China — Ming Yang Smart Energy Group Ltd., Zhejiang Windey Co., Ltd. and Dongfang Electric Corporation Ltd. — expanded market share there.“2020 is set to be another strong year for installations in China and the U.S., as developers rush to build before subsidies lapse,” said Oliver Metcalfe, wind analyst at BNEF. “But uncertainty post-2020 could expose some bigger players unless they diversify to new growth markets.”As for as offshore wind, Siemens Gamesa kept its top spot as Orsted A/S built out its 1.2 gigawatt Hornsea facility in the British section of the North Sea. Vestas pools its offshore wind assets in the MHI Vestas Offshore Wind A/S venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan.The offshore wind market will probably continue to grow faster than its onshore counterpart because the large size and scale of machines sited at sea.Last year, GE received its first orders for the biggest turbine on the market, the Haliade-X, which it will deliver in the U.S. and U.K. in the coming years. That’s a sign that competition will only intensify now that the number of major offshore turbine suppliers has grown to three. Bloomberg.com"

Since its inception, Ark has earned almost 2.4 times more than the S&P 500 and 1.7 times the Nasdaq, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.We're all about finding the next big thing 
 
At a point when money management mostly is a passive, index-driven business, Wood is a discerning stock picker with about US$11 billion of assets. Her selection of health-care juggernauts Juno Therapeutics Inc., based in Seattle, and Invitae Corp., in San Francisco, returned 286 per cent and 173 per cent, respectively, in the past three years. Choosing Palo Alto-based Tesla and Buenos Aires-based MercadoLibre Inc. among consumer discretionary companies netted 185 per cent and 269 per cent in her fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“We’re all about finding the next big thing,” said Wood during an initial interview with David Westin on Bloomberg Wall Street Week earlier this month. “Anyone hewing to the benchmarks, which are backwards looking, they’re not about the future. They are about what has worked. We’re all about what is going to work.”Since she graduated summa cum laude in finance and economics from the University of Southern California in 1981, Wood has been assistant economist at the Capital Group; chief economist, analyst, portfolio manager and director at Jennison Associates; co-founder of the hedge fund Tupelo Capital Management, and chief investment officer of global thematic strategies at AllianceBernstein, where she managed more than US$5 billion. Her favorite innovator is Copernicus, the Renaissance man who located the sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe.Soon after launching Ark in 2014, Wood made Tesla her fifth-largest holding. In 2018, she increased it to No. 1, or 10 per cent of the fund, as most analysts soured on the maker of zero-emission, battery-electric vehicles.In 2016, when Tesla plummeted 11 per cent, and 75 per cent of the analyst recommendations opposed any purchases, Wood almost tripled her Tesla position to 5,072 shares. The following year, after Tesla appreciated 46 per cent, and 68 per cent of the analysts remained bearish, she enlarged her stake more than 13 times to 67,653 shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When Tesla rallied 26 per cent last year amid tepid recommendations from 70 per cent of the analysts, she almost doubled her stake to 471,594 shares.Tesla continued climbing this year — 91 per cent, the best performer in the Nasdaq 100 index and No. 1 among the 500 most highly capitalized U.S. companies. Wood was a consistent seller during the rally — reducing her holding to 292,000 shares — solely to keep her Tesla stake at the designated maximum 10 per cent of her fund.“If we hadn’t sold, Tesla would probably be well north of 20 per cent in the portfolio,” she said during a phone interview last week. “Last year, we were buying aggressively when analysts were saying Tesla was going to run out of cash and go bankrupt.” Tesla still is “incredibly undervalued,” she said.That’s an opinion considered absurd by most analysts, who insist nothing justifies Tesla’s valuation at almost US$150 billion, or 58 per cent more than the market capitalization of global sales leader Volkswagen AG.On the contrary, says Wood, Tesla’s share of EV sales increased a percentage point to 18 per cent when the so-called Tesla killers — from BYD Co. Ltd and BAIC Motor Corp. in China to Nissan Motor Co. in Japan and Volkswagen, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG in Germany and General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in the U.S — started selling their own battery-electric vehicles. Wood believes the legacy automakers will lose money on their EVs, while Tesla becomes increasingly profitable and remains years ahead of its rivals in battery and chip technology.The company also has 14 billion miles of real-world driving data. Its closest competitor, Waymo, has data on 20 million miles.The investors who have been Tesla naysayers have gotten far more attention than Wood. News articles about Tesla short sellers, including David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital LLC and Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates Ltd., are far more numerous on the Bloomberg system. More than 100 stories showcased Einhorn’s disdain for Tesla, and more than 40 similarly featured Chanos, while there were around 20 for Wood during the same period.Investors were similarly dubious about Amazon.com, which appreciated 1,029 per cent during its first five years after the initial public offering in 1997 and 228 per cent during its second five-year period. Tesla has gained 1,018 per cent during the five years after its 2010 IPO and appreciated 206 per cent since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “It’s the same idea that analysts hated Amazon during that entire period – not on the bubble but after the tech and telecom bust,” Wood said.In her latest assessment last month, she wrote: “Based on our updated expectations for electric vehicle (EV) cost declines and demand, as well as our estimates for the potential profitability of robotaxis, our 2024 expected value per share for TSLA is US$7,000.”That’s a far cry from the US$340 in August 2018, when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted: “Am considering taking Tesla private at US$420. Funding secured.”Musk subsequently received a letter from Wood urging him not to take the company private because she saw Tesla rallying to US$4,000 in five years. Before the month ended, he said his plan to take Tesla private wasn’t “the better path.” Even Musk seemed impressed by Wood’s judgment. “The letter was to him and the board, and he did say that he and the board took the letter into consideration and it did influence them,” she said.Tesla said last week that it will sell about US$2 billion of new shares and that Musk would purchase as much as US$10 million of the offering.“I’m not going to tell you we were the reason,” Wood said. “We were a little peapod back them, and we’re still a little peapod in the scheme of the asset management world.” But, she said, “I think our research is the best in the world on Tesla.”So far at least, she’s been right on the money.With assistance from Shin PeiBloomberg.com"

His 130-word post on Instagram was light on detail, but there’s still a lot we can tell based on what we do know.This isn’t Bezos’s first big climate announcement, of course. In September, the world’s richest man committed Amazon to a “climate pledge” to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. That announcement came after months of protests from employees wanting the company to do more on climate change, especially in comparison to tech peers like Microsoft and Google.         View this post on Instagram           Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth.  It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ – Jeff A post shared by  Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) on Feb 17, 2020 at 10:00am PSTThe Bezos Earth Fund will be different from the Bill Gates-led US$1-billion Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund, which seeks to make investments that will generate returns. Instead, Bezos wants to make donations to scientists, activists and NGOs. That changes the game in climate philanthropy.

Just look at the fund’s size. The total donated to climate-related causes in the U.S., which forms the major chunk of global giving, is about US$500 million annually, says Noah Deich, executive director of Carbon 180, an NGO focused on carbon removal. Even if Bezos were to hand out his sum over a 20-year period, he would likely double donations for the cause. That gives Bezos the power to heavily influence the direction that climate philanthropies take as a whole.But deploying all of that money effectively will be difficult, even if Bezos employs an army of climate experts. The model of mega-philanthropy comes with limits. In his recent book, Winners Take All, the writer Anand Giridharadas suggests that the best-intended billionaire giving likely has impacts only on the margins.Another potential problem is that there aren’t that many organizations that can make good use of such large sums of capital, experts in the field say. For comparison, the Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club, two of the largest environmental organizations in the U.S., spend about US$200 million and US$85 million annually.What about scientific research? Donating a chunk of the fund to research could fit with Bezos’s thinking behind the Blue Origin space venture, namely that the Earth is a garden that we should protect by moving heavy industry to space. If instead, Bezos is thinking about supporting Earth-bound climate solutions, he only has to look at Gates, who has supported ventures for years that have yet to make a big dent on the emissions curve.But in the end, most experts I spoke to say that the most effective use of Bezos’s money could be on politics. The Instagram post says that he is interested in donating to “activists.” But ultimately, governments have more power than anyone to bend the emissions curve through legislation and regulation. Even more than a man whose wealth is estimated at US$130 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Putting climate-friendly politicians into office in the U.S. and across the world could be the best way to do that.That is a “straightforward and unsophisticated” way of trying to put the world back on track, says Noah Kaufman, a climate and energy economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.And it would probably cost a lot less than US$10 billion.Akshat Rathi writes the Net Zero newsletter on the intersection of climate science and emission-free tech.Bloomberg.com"

In the meantime, it will accelerate investments in Asia, where the bank draws the bulk of its profit but is grappling with risks from the Hong Kong protests and China’s coronavirus outbreak. The board is also deciding whether the sweeping overhaul announced by interim boss Noel Quinn is enough to secure him the top job permanently.“Parts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns,” Quinn said in the bank’s full-year earnings statement on Tuesday. Quinn, who is also exiting several business lines, also said staff numbers could drop by 15 per cent within the next three years.“We are looking at an endgame of closer to 200,000,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.The cutbacks will extend into parts of HSBC’s European and U.S. investment banking businesses, particularly in fixed income. In the U.S., assets linked to its trading operations will be nearly halved under the new plan. HSBC is also scaling bank its retail network by 30 per cent.The shares fell more than 5 per cent in London trading, the most in three years and the biggest drop among Europe’s banks. HSBC also suspended share buybacks for 2020 and 2021, when most of the restructuring will occur.The fresh strategy makes sense, but is “on the conservative side,” Alan Higgins, chief investment officer of Coutts & Co., said on Bloomberg television.The lender will bolster its investment banking units in Asia and the Middle East. Questions have mounted over HSBC’s relatively poor returns given its exposure to many of the world’s fastest-growing economies, particularly China.“We are intending to exit a lot of domestically-focused customers in Europe and the U.S. on the global banking side,” Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Management will be “surgical and ruthless” in targeting parts of the business where returns aren’t acceptable, he said.Executives said on a conference call that the loan book has shown “great resilience” so far in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. However, the bank warned the virus and economic disruption in Hong Kong may impact its 2020 performance.“While reduced capital allocation to low-return businesses is a positive, we expect weaker profitability in what have traditionally been strong markets, primarily Hong Kong,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, maintaining their underweight rating on HSBC.Speculation had mounted months ago that Quinn was likely to get the CEO’s role on a permanent basis, but that has faded. People familiar with the matter said earlier this month that HSBC was seriously considering external candidates.On the conference call, Tucker declined to clarify whether the bank is closer to finding its next CEO.Stevenson also said there was no update on HSBC’s review of its French division. Efforts to sell HSBC’s French retail business are progressing, people familiar with the matter have said.The main points of today’s earnings report include:HSBC’s adjusted pretax profit of US$22.2 billion beat estimates, despite the multi-billion dollar charge for the restructuring. HSBC had been forecast to report adjusted pretax profit of US$21.8 billion, according to analysts.

Europe’s benchmark Stoxx Tech Index fell as much as 1.6 per cent on Tuesday, with Dialog Semiconductor Plc down 6 per cent, AMS AG dropping 5.1 per cent and STMicroelectronics NV falling 4.8 per cent.

The shares fell as much as 2.9 per cent in Amsterdam.Mirabaud’s Neil Campling said that Apple’s warning threatens to open the “floodgates” as the virus affects supply chains around the world. The Chinese factories that make the iPhone, Apple’s main revenue generator, are ramping up production slower than expected as they work to contain the virus, which has killed more than 1,800 people in the country. Chinese demand has also been held down as stores closed and customers stayed away, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement on Monday.

“The semiconductor industry and supply chain is both complex and truly global,” Campling said in emailed comments. “As we navigate through the rest of the quarter, we continue to see a high probability of there being a plethora of downward revisions.”In Asia, Apple suppliers TDK Corp. dropped 4.7 per cent and Murata Manufacturing Co. declined 4.2 per cent in Tokyo.

A decision, which was expected in the last two days, is now dragging on into Friday or beyond, the people said.The crux of the debate: whether to take the highest offer, from Finnish rival Kone Oyj, despite antitrust risks or go with competing bids from private-equity suitors that don’t have competition issues. The deal would be the biggest acquisition in Europe this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bidding groups led by Blackstone Group Inc., Advent International and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. each offered close to 16 billion euros, according to the people.Deteriorating FinancesThyssenkrupp, once an emblem of German industrial prowess, can barely afford to wait. The steelmaker has been bruised by a manufacturing slowdown and rising pension costs. The company on Thursday announced quarterly results that laid bare the company’s rapidly deteriorating finances as debt surged and losses deepened.The three private equity bidders are each pitching why they’d be the best owner.

Discussions are ongoing, and suitors are still making tweaks to their offers, the people said.Representatives for Advent, Blackstone, Brookfield and Kone declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp has said it will make a decision by the end of February, according to a representative for the company, who declined to comment further.Antitrust ConcernsThyssenkrupp Chief Financial Officer Johannes Dietsch said Thursday a deal with a strategic investor would mean the company only receives the money after a long, thorough antitrust review. This must be taken into account when Thyssenkrupp decides the best way forward, Dietsch said on a conference call with reporters.Shares of Thyssenkrupp were up 1.1 per cent at 9:16 a.m. Friday in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of 7 billion euros.Finland’s Kone, the only remaining strategic bidder, has tried hard to address concerns about a drawn-out competition review. It plans to hand the elevator operations in Europe to bidding partner CVC Capital Partners, while offering to fully assume any antitrust risks. It has also promised a multibillion-euro upfront payment that Thyssenkrupp would keep even if the deal is blocked by competition authorities, Bloomberg News reported last month.Some executives at Thyssenkrupp fear that heavy scrutiny from European antitrust authorities on a Kone bid would lead to months of delays and perhaps the ultimate failure of the deal. The German company’s aborted attempt to merge its steel business with Tata Steel Europe still haunts executives, who thought European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager unfairly torpedoed the plans.Some private equity suitors have offered major Thyssenkrupp investors the chance to keep a minority stake in the elevator unit and have discussed plans to relist the business in Germany in a few years, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Bloomberg.com"

The government is wielding some prior allegations of wrongdoing, like Huawei’s alleged theft of a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile US Inc., to build a more muscular case.

An email to Huawei’s lawyers seeking comment on the new charges wasn’t immediately returned. The company has denied the allegations, while China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the U.S to “stop unreasonably targeting Huawei and other Chinese enterprises.” Through her lawyer, Meng has denied wrongdoing.The latest claims reflect decades of efforts by Huawei and several of its units, in both the U.S. and China, “to misappropriate intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies, in an effort to grow and operate Huawei’s business,” the Justice Department said.It said the property “included trade secret information and copyrighted works, such as source code and user manuals for internet routers, antenna technology and robot testing technology” and cited an “alleged long-running practice of using fraud and deception” to steal sensitive technology from U.S. rivals.The U.S. has banned the company’s technology and accused Huawei of aiding Beijing in espionage. Huawei, in turn, has accused the government of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. The accusations have increased tensions between Huawei and the administration of President Donald Trump.Prosecutors in January 2019 charged Huawei and Meng with conspiracy to commit bank fraud for allegedly misleading banks about the company’s doing business in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. In the new indictment, they allege that Huawei and three of its entities engaged in a racketeering scheme in New York, California, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey, Texas and Washington state.The U.S. also claims that Huawei conspired to steal trade secrets from multiple victim companies in a series of incidents dating back to 2002.Huawei faces separate charges in Seattle.The case is U.S. v.

Even with its earnings increase, Manulife fell short of estimates, partly hurt by slowing growth in Asia.“Weak sales trends in Japan were a drag on growth in the Asia segment,” National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine said in a note to investors, calling Manulife’s results “mixed.” “On the other hand, we believe capital updates were clearly positive.”While the Toronto-based insurers are at risk of continued pain from disruptions in Asia, both benefited from a rising equity market, with the S&P 500 index increasing 29 per cent last year. Manulife had core earnings of $1.48 billion (US$1.11 billion) in the fourth quarter, with global wealth and asset management having the biggest gain among the insurer’s four main operating businesses. Sun Life also saw the largest increase at its asset-management division.

“We saw good growth across asset management in the U.S. and Canada,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain said in an interview, adding the company’s alternative assets management business “hit a high.”Sun Life shares rose 0.4 per cent to $65.56 at 9:48 a.m. in Toronto and have surged 42 per cent in the past year. Manulife slumped 1.5 per cent to $26.22. Its shares are up 25 per cent in the past 12 months.Sun Life’s core earnings of $1.34 a share beat the $1.30 average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey, while Manulife’s core earnings of 73 US cents fell short of the 75-cent estimate. Manulife, Canada’s largest insurer, nevertheless posted record annual earnings, increased its dividend 12 per cent and surpassed one of its long-term goals three years ahead of schedule.Asia GrowthBoth Manulife and Sun Life saw lower profit growth in Asia, which has been an important earnings driver. The 6.7 per cent increase in Manulife’s Asian operations was the slowest in at least two years, with Chief Executive Officer Roy Gori citing the “headwinds” of the protests in Hong Kong and new rules in Japan around corporate-owned life insurance products, which hurt sales.Sun Life’s Asia business rose 2 per cent from a year earlier, the slowest growth among its four main divisions, due to what CFO Strain called an “unfavourable experience” in its China joint venture and some investment-related issues.“This quarter had more to do with some one-time things,” he said. “I don’t see anything that takes us off our thesis of Asia growing at 15 per cent” in the medium term.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic said in a note that Sun Life’s “Asia results were softer than expected and future earnings could be at risk due to coronavirus and Hong Kong unrest.”Manulife, meanwhile, made progress on some of its long-term goals. The company freed up $5.1 billion of capital from legacy businesses by the fourth quarter, reaching its capital-efficiency target three years early. The insurer also achieved its medium-term leverage target of 25 per cent.“I really feel good about the progress that we made on a very important initiative for the franchise,” Chief Executive Officer Roy Gori said in an interview. “That really not only strengthens our capital position and our balance sheet, but really puts us in good stead for the future in terms of how to deploy capital to create value for the shareholder.”Bloomberg.com"

Bombardier said in a statement it is also pursuing other “strategic options to accelerate deleveraging.” The company is near a deal to sell its rail-equipment unit to Alstom SA, Bloomberg News reported.“The CSeries was a cash drain,” Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare, said in a call with analysts Thursday. “The strategy was always to exit commercial aircraft while protecting jobs. We’ve done that at a very responsible matter. We are now with two very strong businesses and we are continuing to look at our options to see if we can continue deleveraging.”The dismembering positions Montreal-based Bombardier to retain only its private-jet division — while giving it a path to taming a US$10 billion debt load.

And there’s likely more divestitures to come. Alstom and Bombardier could reach an agreement as early as this week, though talks could still be delayed or fall apart, according to people familiar with the matter. Alstom could pay about 7 billion euros (US$7.6 billion) for the rail business, Handelsblatt reported earlier, without saying where it got the information. The embattled manufacturer is also exploring the sale of its corporate-jet operation to Textron Inc., maker of Cessna planes, the Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 4.The Montreal-based company sold its turboprop-plane business to Longview Aviation Capital Corp. last year, and has agreements in place to offload its regional-jet operation and a wing plant in Northern Ireland. Those deals are on track to close in the first half of 2020, the company said in a statement Thursday as it reported a loss in line with expectations.Show MeAirbus is paying $591 million to Bombardier to raise its stake to 75 per cent. That, combined with the other aerospace divestitures, will bring in more than US$1.6 billion in cash and eliminate almost US$2 billion in liabilities, according to the statement.With positive free cash flow and the A220 divestiture, there are some positive elements for this “show me” story, Stephen Trent and Brian Roberts, analysts at Citigroup Global Markets, said.“Assuming that this smaller company now generates cash, it remains to be seen whether Bombardier further monetizes its remaining businesses, a potential positive catalyst – and a US$52.1 billion firm order book might be a good place to start the conversation,” the analysts said.Caisse HoldingThe deal keeps about 3,300 Airbus jobs in Quebec while boosting the provincial government’s share in the A220 to 25 per cent from 16 per cent for no cash. While Premier Francois Legault kept his promise not to add to the $1 billion his predecessor had poured into the plane less than four years ago, it’s unclear how much of upcoming costs his government will shoulder. Bombardier said its future capital requirements for the single-aisle plane were estimated at US$700 million.“We are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact Bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry,” Bellemare said in the statement. “We are equally proud of the responsible way in which we have exited commercial aerospace, preserving jobs and reinforcing the aerospace cluster in Quebec and Canada.Any rail deal will also get Quebec involved as the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the province’s influential pension fund manager, owns part of the Berlin-based train business. It spent US$1.5 billion in 2016 for the 30 per cent stake. That’s now grown into a 32.5 per cent holding after the unit’s results failed to reach the targets underlying Caisse’s investment, Bombardier said Thursday.Bombardier reported an adjusted loss of 10 cents. Sales fell 2.3 per cent to US$4.21 billion. Analysts had expected US$4.23 billion.With assistance from Divya Balji.Bloomberg.com"

There’s little sign of that trend abating even as oil and gas companies face increasing scrutiny over the the roles they play in climate change.Much like their counterparts in the U.S. and globally, Canadian lenders are under pressure to show they’re doing their part in fighting carbon emissions and rising temperatures. They want to show they’re delivering on green promises they’ve made, yet they’re steadfast in supporting an industry that is key to Canada’s resource-heavy economy.

“The Canadian banks understand there’s an issue here and they’re trying to work on it,” said Laura Zizzo, founder and chief executive officer of Toronto-based climate consultancy Mantle314.Energy financing is becoming slightly less important for the banks, which collectively lend more to the real estate and financial services industries. Oil and gas loans accounted for an average of 5.2 per cent of corporate financing at the big banks in 2019, down from 6.3 per cent five years ago. Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank bucked that trend, with oil and gas loans representing a greater share of their corporate lending after acquiring energy books from foreign banks.The Canadian banks understand there's an issue here and they're trying to work on itLaura Zizzo 
 
Bank of Montreal more than doubled oil and gas lending in five years, peaking at $13.5 billion last year, driven up by the 2018 purchase of energy loans from Deutsche Bank AG and an overall corporate-financing surge. Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said in a BNN Bloomberg television interview last month that the bank’s support of legacy fossil-fuel clients helps them shift to a cleaner economy.“It’s all about supporting leaders who want to transition over time — and it does take time, and it will take time — to a lower-carbon economy,” White said.More Than DoubledAt Toronto-Dominion, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets, loans to pipeline, oil and gas firms more than doubled to US$9.22 billion since 2014, though part of the jump was from the purchase of energy loans from Royal Bank of Scotland about four years ago.While the bank “is actively supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy,” Toronto-Dominion is “aware that Canadians will rely on conventional energy sources for several more decades to sustain our economy, create jobs and support a standard of living for our customers and communities,” spokeswoman Lynsey Wynberg said in a statement.

Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, pared loans to the industry in 2016 and 2017, but they’ve since climbed back steadily. Shifting to greener energy production requires a strong economy aided by contributions from the traditional energy sector, CEO Dave McKay said.“You need fossil-based fuels to make that transition,” he said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month. “They’re not going away overnight.”Scotiabank, CIBCMcKay’s bank is hardly alone in its support of the industry. Bank of Nova Scotia had the most energy loans last year, while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CEO Victor Dodig in November gave his backing to Canada’s energy companies, saying the bank “will be there to help address the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.”Among the country’s largest lenders, National Bank of Canada is alone in shrinking its oil and gas loan book, to $2.75 billion last year from $3.62 billion in 2014. Such financing represented 4.4 per cent of overall corporate loans in 2019, almost half the portion five years earlier.Not all energy financing is equal, and more disclosures are needed to show whether loans are backing environmentally friendly projects, said Zizzo of Mantle314.“When the banks are giving a facility to an energy company, they usually don’t delineate if that’s going toward something we should think about as transition or as propping up a mature and dirtier aspect of the energy sector,” she said. “This is a real conundrum.”

Fossil-fuel companies themselves are under pressure to become greener. Suncor Energy Inc. and Cenovus Energy Inc. set goals of reducing their emissions per barrel of oil produced by 30 per cent by 2030, and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and MEG Energy Corp. have set long-term goals of net zero emissions from their oilsands operations.Canada’s five biggest banks have each set targets that could support such efforts. Scotiabank was the latest, offering in November to “mobilize” US$100 billion by 2025 to reduce climate-change impacts. CIBC committed in September to support US$150 billion in environmental and sustainable finance activities by 2027, while Bank of Montreal said last June it would provide US$150 billion in capital by 2025 to companies pursuing sustainable outcomes.“It’s really great to galvanize interest in the sustainable finance that’s required,” Zizzo said. “But I think it’s really just a first step of what’s needed.”Bloomberg.com"

The sales have forced Barrick to narrow its five-year annual production range to 4.8 million to 5.2 million ounces. “This is our base plan and of course there are upsides that we’re working on.” In November, Barrick had said it expected to maintain its five-year gold production within a range of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces, based on its portfolio at the time.The company plans to release 10-year production guidance at its annual general meeting later this year, Bristow said. Barrick is thinking about what the company should look like long-term, including its mix between copper and gold production.In December, Bristow said Barrick may some day look into a possible merger with Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the largest publicly traded copper producer. On Wednesday, Bristow said that idea is still at a conceptual stage, but could include anything from a merger to the acquisition of Freeport assets. “Copper is the most strategic metal,” Bristow said.On Wednesday, the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 40 per cent as it reported adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share for the fourth quarter, beating the highest analyst estimate.Barrick is benefiting from rising bullion prices, reporting fourth-quarter revenue of US$2.88 billion that also topped analysts’ estimate.

The company also provides point-of-sale services in brick-and-mortar stores, competing with Square Inc.The company also swung to a profit in the fourth quarter, reporting US$771 million, compared with a loss of US$1.5 billion a year earlier. Profit excluding some costs was 43 US cents a share in the quarter, beating analysts’ projection for 24 US cents.“Shopify’s 4Q 2019 performance was impressive in our view,” said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, in a note following the results. “We were particularly encouraged by the gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth, which further demonstrates how Shopify is ‘democratizing commerce’ and providing value to its merchants.”

Besides fulfillment centres, the company has rolled out tools such as chat and email, as well as video and 3D modelling for products to help merchants improve marketing and build direct relationships with buyers. Such investments combined with the company’s push to capture international markets could prevent any significant margin expansion in 2020, said Anurag Rana, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, in a Feb. 5 note.Chief Financial Officer Amy Shapero acknowledged on an earnings call that 2020 is “clearly a year of heavy investment” for Shopify, but the company expects to see strong growth from the resulting increase in clients and gross merchandise volume, she added.Shopify said it expects an operating loss in the range of US$324 million to US$344 million in 2020.While it mainly caters to small and medium businesses, Shopify also counts high-profile brands such as Gatorade, Aerosoles, Victoria Beckham Beauty, Heineken, and SpaceX. Shopify Plus, a segment geared toward companies with high sales volumes, has been key to attracting such larger brands. Shopify Plus contributed 27 per cent of the company’s overall monthly recurring revenue, compared with 25.4 per cent in the same quarter last year.Bloomberg.com"

A NEO spokesman confirmed the listing, which is pending final approvals.The company plans to list via a reverse takeover under the ticker MMED. It’s not yet generating revenue and is targeting a valuation of approximately US$50 million, Rahn said. Mind Medicine counts former Canopy Growth Corp. co-chief executive officer Bruce Linton as a director and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary as an investor.

“Our ambition is to be one of the first publicly listed neuro-pharmaceutical companies developing psychedelic medicines,” Rahn said in a phone interview.Clinical trialsFor those who are still getting used to legal marijuana, the idea of publicly traded companies working with psychedelic drugs like MDMA and psilocybin, which is derived from magic mushrooms, may sound a bit out there.Yet a growing number of companies are conducting clinical trials of psychedelic treatments for everything from depression to post-traumatic stress disorder, and some have recently received the blessing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This has created a legal way for these companies to conduct research on otherwise illegal drugs, opening the door to public listings.In late 2018, the FDA gave “breakthrough therapy” status to a psilocybin treatment developed by London-based Compass Pathways Ltd. for clinical depression, expediting the development process.Meanwhile, Toronto-based Mind Medicine is preparing a Phase 2 clinical trial into the use of a psychedelic called ibogaine to treat opioid addiction, which will be conducted in New York and governed by the FDA.Compass Pathways declined to comment on whether it’s planning a public listing, but the company is “always looking at options to ensure continued growth and funding,” chief communications officer Tracy Cheung said in an email.The Canadian Securities Exchange, which has become the go-to bourse for U.S. cannabis companies that can’t list in their home country, is also expecting listings from psychedelic drug companies in 2020.The FDA has “given clearance for a variety of trials at this point and it looks like they are going to be expanding that framework,” said Richard Carleton, CEO of the Canadian Securities Exchange. “If that is the case then I’m certain we’ll see our first issuers probably before the middle of the year.”Institutional capitalThere’s growing investor interest in psychedelics, said Ronan Levy, executive chairman of Field Trip Psychedelics Inc. Field Trip is building a network of clinics focused on ketamine-enhanced psychotherapy, with the first one opening in Toronto next month and others planned for New York City and Los Angeles. It’s also conducting research into psilocybin at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.Last week, Field Trip closed a Series A financing round that raised US$8.5 million from a variety of investors including cannabis-focused asset manager Silver Spike Capital and Harris Fricker, the former CEO of GMP Capital Inc., which helped a number of marijuana companies go public.The funding round attracted interest from all over the world, including “some very large Silicon Valley tech investors and entrepreneurs,” Levy said.Field Trip is considering a public listing, although Levy also sees further opportunities to raise private funding, he said. Unlike cannabis, which remains federally illegal in the U.S., the work psychedelic companies are doing is legal. This creates “greater opportunity to access growth capital from private investors in the U.S. who may not touch cannabis,” he said.It also sets the industry apart from cannabis, which has seen stock prices collapse amid slower-than-expected sales in Canada and ongoing federal illegality in the U.S.“I think that the psychedelics industry could be much bigger than the cannabis industry because it’s going to attract institutional capital and already is starting to,” Rahn said. “It’s also going to be a more concentrated space because the barriers to entry are much higher.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}","David McLaughlin, Erik Larson and Scott Moritz",Huge win for T-Mobile as court approves $26 billion Sprint deal,Ruling clear path for deal,https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/mobile-sprint-merger-wins-approval-as-u-s-judge-rejects-antitrust-concerns,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/t-mobile.jpg,"February 11, 2020 8:41 AM EST","T-Mobile US Inc. won court approval for its US$26.5 billion takeover of Sprint Corp., defeating a state-led lawsuit that sought to block the industry-altering wireless deal.The decision by a district judge in Manhattan is a huge win for T-Mobile and its owner Deutsche Telekom AG, as well as SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint’s parent.The combined company, which will operate under the T-Mobile name, will have a regular monthly subscriber base of about 80 million — in the same league as AT&T Inc., which has 75 million subscribers, and Verizon Communications Inc., which has 114 million.After the merger, T-Mobile will have more spectrum — the frequencies through which wireless signals are transmitted — than any other carrier. This larger capacity will give the combined company an advantage as the industry transitions to the next generation of wireless technology, the much-faster 5G standard.The ruling comes almost two years after the deal was first announced. The states’ lawsuit was the last major hurdle to the deal after it secured the blessing of regulators at the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department’s antitrust division. It still needs approvals from California’s utility board and a federal judge in Washington who must sign off on the Justice Department settlement.Deutsche Telekom shares rose as much as 3.6 per cent to 15.40 euros in Frankfurt. Shares of Sprint soared 66 per cent to US$7.95 in pre-market trading in New York after closing at US$4.80 Monday in New York. T-Mobile extended gains to as much as 8.4 per cent to US$91.88.The ruling is also a victory for Dish Network Corp. co-founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen, who is buying assets from the two carriers to set up a new wireless network. With his company’s core satellite TV business in decline, Ergen has amassed a trove of airwaves to build a state-of-the-art network.ConcessionsTo win federal approval, T-Mobile and Sprint had agreed to sell multiple assets to Dish in order to create a new fourth competitor. The new Dish wireless network will start life with about 9 million subscribers.T-Mobile and Sprint haven’t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed on Nov. 1. And while there have been “not hostile” discussions of several issues, including price, T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere said last week he was still optimistic that the deal would go through, though the terms could change. If the agreement needs to be amended, “including possibly price, we would handle that very swiftly after the deal was approved,” he said.As far as negotiation leverage goes, Sprint’s in a tough spot, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with LightShed Partners. “Sprint has no alternative but to take whatever DT and T-Mobile offers them,” he said. “There’s really nothing else they can do.”T-Mobile and Sprint had been the most aggressive U.S. wireless companies in terms of price competition in recent years, forcing AT&T and Verizon to follow moves like ending service contracts and adopting unlimited data plans. The proposed combination came under fire from lawmakers and consumer advocates who said it would lead to higher prices and fewer services, especially for poor and rural consumers. The companies had pursued a combination for several years, but a proposed deal was twice rejected as anti-competitive under the previous administration. After the FCC approved the deal, the all-Democratic group of attorneys general filed suit. The Justice Department then gave its approval, leading to a rare split between states and the federal government over antitrust enforcement.“This is exactly the sort of consumer-harming, job-killing mega-merger our antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the time.Tackling ConcernsLegere tried to address these concerns by promising to not raise prices for three years. He is credited with helping to remake T-Mobile into an industry maverick, and pitched the Sprint takeover as a way to compete against industry leaders Verizon and AT&T.Legere announced in November that he will be handing off the job to Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert in May, but plans to remain on the combined company’s board.One of their central pitches was that the deal would advance the introduction of 5G. The companies pledged to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in May that they would deploy a 5G network covering 97 per cent of the U.S. population within three years and 99 per cent within six.With assistance from Stefan Nicola, Chris Dolmetsch and Courtney Dentch.Bloomberg.com"

But there could be at least one unexpected suitor.Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP may be a “dark horse” buyer should the opportunity arise as it recently completed a big equity raise and has “excellent access to capital markets,” Ian Gillies, an analyst at Stifel FirstEnergy said in a report published Monday. Brookfield had purchased NorthRiver Midstream Inc. in 2018, highlighting its interest and ability to run energy infrastructure assets.The price tag for the Trans Mountain expansion has increased 70 per cent to $12.6 billion given legal delays and accommodations made to indigenous communities along its route. The project is now owned by Justin Trudeau’s government, who purchased it from U.S.-based Kinder Morgan Inc. for US$4.5 billion. 
Hold the champagne on the Trans Mountain decision for a few more months, at least
Just last week, parent company Brookfield Asset Management Inc. raised US$20 billion in equity commitments for its flagship global infrastructure fund and the firm itself committed US$5 billion of capital, which will be funded through Brookfield Infrastructure and Brookfield Renewable Partners LP.“Any further cost overruns would make Trans Mountain an unattractive M&A candidate for existing Canadian infrastructure companies,” Gillies said in a note to clients:Pension and private equity funds could also look at the project, however the former may face ESG-related headwinds given the Trans Mountain pipeline ships crude from Canada’s oilsands, Gillies said. Various Indigenous groups to also pursue Trans Mountain, he said adding that the pipeline company now has agreements with 58 First Nations groups, up from 43. Pembina Pipeline Corp. could “at least review the transaction” given its enterprise value of $44 billion.

Economists in a Bloomberg survey had anticipated starts would be 205,000.It’s the highest level of new construction in four months, after a slowdown at the end of 2019, and suggests builders may be responding to the recovery in demand in some of the nation’s largest housing markets.

“With recent data pointing to further tightening in demand-supply conditions in many resale markets, a solid pace of home building to start the year will be welcomed,” Josh Nye, a senior economist at RBC Economics, said in a note to investors.In a separate report Monday, Statistics Canada said building permits rose 7.4 per cent in December, more than double the 2.8 per cent median forecast from economists. The increase is consistent with the housing starts data for January, and included a 47 per cent surge in Toronto intentions, the most 2014.A combination of steady population growth, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs have brought buyers back into markets that had been lacklustre for much of 2018 and early 2019. Combined with shrinking supply, the rising number of buyers has driven bids for homes higher in places like Toronto, where benchmark prices are up 9 per cent over the past year.Starts in Toronto were up 51 per cent from December, on a seasonally adjusted basis, CMHC said.

Canada is the only member of the so-called Five Eyes network of intelligence-sharing nations that has yet to decide what to do with Huawei.

Her arrest in Vancouver at the end of 2018 on a U.S. extradition request plunged the northern nation’s relations with China into their darkest period in a half century. Beijing locked up two Canadians and halted key agricultural imports in the months that followed.The rift with China contributed to a 16 per cent plunge in exports to the Asian powerhouse last year, the largest drop in data going back to 1997.Trudeau’s public safety minister said last month the government is studying the U.K. decision.

Instead, investors are turning their attention to the country’s life insurers.In 2019, shares of Canada’s largest lenders gained 14 per cent, including dividends, lagging the S&P/TSX Composite’s 23 per cent total return — the first time they have trailed the benchmark since 2010. Banks have struggled to eke out strong earnings results as rising loan losses and eroding net interest margins hurt their profitability amid economic growth concerns. That pushed analysts to temper their forecasts for 2020.Life insurers, on the other hand, enjoyed a 40 per cent surge in 2019. Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. posted third-quarter profits last year that topped analysts’ expectations, as gains in Asia fuelled earnings growth.

The banks were performing very well until September 2018, “and then the bloom went off the rose,” said John Kinsey, a portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. Some investors have soured on banks because of concerns about declining interest rates, mortgage quality and high levels of consumer debt, which are a risk to the economy.“The focus changed to the insurers because they hadn’t done well when the banks were performing at their peak,” he said.“Lifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcome,” Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank of Canada, said in a Jan. 28 report. “As long as growth concerns for the banks remain intense, this trend could continue.”Lifeco stocks outperforming bank stocks is an unusual occurrence, with back-to-back annual outperformance an even rarer outcomeGabriel Dechaine 
 
When lifecos release fourth-quarter results next week, analysts are expecting them to show a strong finish to 2019. RBC Capital Markets analyst Darko Mihelic expects they will report a “solid end to a good year with double-digit core EPS growth forecast for all of the lifecos,” reflecting strong equity market performance in the quarter.Investors are betting on insurers after taking a cautious view of the Canadian economy as it suffers a bout of sluggish growth. Traders are anticipating at least one Bank of Canada interest rate cut this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which could continue to hurt the bottom line for banks.

Lower interest rates due to a potential economic downturn can also have a negative impact on insurers. But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.“The relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,” said National Bank’s Dechaine. He also expects them to prioritize share buybacks since several of the companies have “material amounts” of cash.Barclays analyst John Aiken raised his share price targets on Great-West, Manulife and Sun Life in a report last month and said his expectations reflect “strong profitability and an improving operating environment” heading into reporting season.As their shares rally, valuations for Canadian life insurers are almost on par with banks.

That represents the biggest annual increase since October 2017, the month controversial stress tests for mortgage eligibility were announced by the country’s financial regulator. The price gains are being fuelled by a combination of strong demand and shrinking supply, with new listings down 17 per cent in January from a year ago.“Strong sales up against a constrained supply continues to result in an accelerating rate of price growth,” Jason Mercer, director of market analysis for the realtor group, said in the statement.

Toronto’s housing market is bouncing back after a dismal period that lasted through 2018 and early 2019. A combination of steady population growth, low unemployment and cheap borrowing costs have brought buyers who had been sidelined by the stress tests back into the market, Mercer said.Still, the tightening supply has had a dampening effect on sales in recent months, with the number of transactions falling 2.7 per cent in December. That trend reversed sharply in January, with sales rising 4.8 per cent during the month on a seasonally adjusted basis to the highest level in more than a year.The average sale price for a detached homes was $1,038,247 in January, up 10.5 per cent from a year earlier. Condo prices jumped 15.1 per cent from a year ago, to $630,047. Bloomberg.com"

Tesla had added 36 per cent to its value in the first two days of the week, but by Wednesday afternoon, it was just 7.7 per cent higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12 per cent above Friday’s close.The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an “electrifying run” on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.Tesla shares have “had a Bitcoin-like move and profits are being taken off the table with technical levels being hit,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. The analyst expects the stock to settle in the US$700 range and start moving higher again on the potential of its China business, despite coronavirus fears. 
Will Tesla stock run out of fuel soon or can it rocket to US$7,000 — or even beyond?
Tesla’s stock price streak leaves analysts struggling to keep up
Tesla shares could hit $960 in early 2021, company’s biggest bull says
The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.“Look, everybody has a pain threshold,” Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Tom Keene Wednesday. “When a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.” The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.A sense of caution and some confusion prevailed in the market.“Many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been “calm, curious and overall cautious.”That sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping US$109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at US$887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112 per cent. Wednesday’s selloff would pare that back to an year-to-date gain of 73 per cent.Wall Street is pedalling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity’s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely “reset of expectations” in the first quarter and flagging China’s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added US$17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.Wednesday’s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing US$11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including US$5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. That compares with the US$2.82 billion in mark-to-market losses that bearish investors racked up for all of 2019.“The stock has gone up too much too fast, and we should expect it to bounce through a period of volatility,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said. “I think this is people blowing the froth off the top.–With assistance from Ed Ludlow, Janet Freund and Francine Lacqua.Bloomberg.com

Masks, of course, are ubiquitous, and gloves are becoming more common. On a recent Air New Zealand flight from Vancouver to Auckland, flight attendants wore blue surgical gloves when handling passenger’s boarding passes as they entered the plane. Banks have also started requiring tellers to wear gloves to minimize the potential transmission from customers and from notes and coins.The People’s Bank of China, meanwhile, has begun using ultraviolet light and high-temperature ovens to disinfect cash coming in. It’s also replacing old notes with newly minted bills.At the central bank’s branch in Xi’an, a city in central China, it’s piping in ozone to fight the virus. Access to its vault, where banks pick up cash, is restricted to two at a time.The death toll in China has climbed to 490 people, with more than 24,000 infections.

Disney resorts in mainland China and in Hong Kong are closed for now, but the Tokyo park remains open, with precautions. The park staff will wear masks, some of the mascots will refrain from hugging guests, and photo opportunities with the characters will be limited.There’s also the risk employees potentially pose to each other. Employees at Bank of China Co. are allowed to work remotely. Those who’ve come in to the Beijing headquarters have been told to eat lunch at least a meter from coworkers. Small talk is also strongly discouraged, the bank wrote in a notice to employees, saying, “There’s no topic that’s so urgent it’s worth you risking your life to discuss.” Bloomberg.com"

In just the past week, he sold 0.2 per cent of the retailer for US$1.8 billion.Bezos offloaded 905,456 Amazon shares on Friday and Monday under a pre-arranged trading plan, according to filings. That brings his total stock sales to about US$12 billion, with two-thirds of those occurring in the past four years, according to calculations by Bloomberg.The scale of the recent sales — including US$2 billion in 2017 and US$2.8 billion in 2019 — partly reflects Amazon’s soaring valuation, which closed above US$1 trillion for the first time on Tuesday. That means Bezos’s remaining 11 per cent stake is worth US$116 billion.

Their size and frequency though also reflects the changing needs of his increasingly public profile.In the past few years, he’s had a style makeover and rarely been out of the headlines since he and MacKenzie Bezos divorced in 2019. That includes hitting the red carpet with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, hosting a bash at his Washington mansion for the political and financial elite, and even being part of an international controversy after the incendiary claim that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was involved in hacking his phone.It’s a far cry from the low profile Bezos cultivated for years. Like fellow Seattle billionaire Bill Gates, he showed little interest in matching the glitzy lifestyle of other tech titans, such as Oracle Corp.’s Larry Ellison, whose purchases have included a Hawaiian island and super-yacht.That doesn’t mean Bezos hasn’t spent boatloads of money. As well as properties on both coasts, he has his own rural getaway: 170,000 hectares of desert scrub in Texas, where he indulges his passion for space exploration. He’s previously said that he’s funding rocket company Blue Origin LLC with about US$1 billion a year through the sale of Amazon stock.“The price of admission to space is very high,” Bezos said in 2018, accepting the Buzz Aldrin Space Exploration Award at the Explorers Club Annual Dinner. “I’m in the process of converting my Amazon lottery winnings into a much lower price of admission so we can go explore the Solar System.”That still leaves plenty left over for other pursuits, from the Washington Post to a clock built in the Sierra Diablo mountain range in Texas that’s designed to run for 10,000 years. He’s also currently house hunting in Los Angeles, according to the New York Post.His wealth is still soaring. The value of his remaining Amazon stock has climbed by US$11 billion this year.Bloomberg.com

Shares of Textron also surged as analysts said a deal would strengthen its hand in the luxury-aircraft business.The negotiations have been going on for several weeks, and the terms of the potential transaction are unclear, the Journal reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. There’s no guarantee that the discussions will result in any agreement, the newspaper said. Bombardier declined to comment. Textron didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A deal would provide a welcome cash injection for debt-laden Bombardier while removing what was supposed to be a pillar of its future. Once a Canadian industrial champion, Bombardier has also been holding talks to combine its rail-equipment unit with France’s Alstom SA and is considering an exit from a joint venture with Airbus SE to make the A220 jetliner. Bombardier agreed last year to sell its regional-jet business to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.

Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, valued Bombardier’s private-jet business at US$6.7 billion. She said other makers of luxury aircraft would benefit from stronger pricing power if the Montreal-based company reached a deal with Textron, the maker of Cessna planes.‘Price Discipline’“Given the market deliveries have been stagnant around the 650 unit mark, consolidation has always been a possibility,” Kahyaoglu said in a note. “We would assume consolidation would lead to increased price discipline.”Bombardier jumped 10 per cent to $1.43 at 2:26 p.m. in Toronto. The shares fell 33 per cent this year through Monday, the worst drop on Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index, after Bombardier warned of disappointing fourth-quarter sales. The company also said it may exit the A220 program and warned of a possible writedown.The company’s 7.85 per cent bonds due 2027 climbed 1.3 US cents to 97 US cents on the dollar, yielding 8.5 per cent, according to Trace data.Textron rose 7.8 per cent to US$49.88 after advancing as much as 11 per cent, the most intraday in nine months.Bombardier’s rail talks with Alstom have slowed down, partly over the valuation of an operation that has had production stumbles, the Journal said.Larger JetsThe Canadian company’s openness to selling its private-jet business signals a weaker outlook for its rail operation, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson. A deal with Textron would probably include Bombardier’s Global and Challenger lines of luxury aircraft.The Textron negotiation “affirms our view that rail cash flow will be weak over the next few years, requiring divestment of assets to pay down debt with maturities beginning in mid-2021,” Ferguson said in a report. “We expect a sale would include large jets such as the Global and Challenger lines, as Lear won’t garner much cash.”–With assistance from Sandrine Rastello and Thomas Black."

Roughly half of the exchange-traded fund’s gain since Dec. 31 can be attributed to owning Tesla, which has more than doubled its stock price over the same period.The fund is run by Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood, who reiterated her bullish call on the car company last week as the firm boosted its price target for Tesla to US$7,000 by 2024. Betting against Tesla has proved a humbling experience for investors — compounded by the company’s record quarterly revenue — and sidelined short-sellers could speak to further gains for Tesla-heavy ETFs, according to WallachBeth Capital. 
Tesla just surged 15% to over $900 in a rally that has doubled its value since January
“Shorting has been very painful, and investors who are short have been flushed out,” said Mohit Bajaj, WallachBeth’s director of ETFs. “I would think shorters are going recalibrate to higher levels before shorting again.”ARKW rose 14 per cent through Feb. 3, exceeding the performance of more than 1,400 rival funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It is also the best-performing unleveraged stock ETF in the U.S. over the last three years.Tesla’s boom has also boosted funds such as the US$146 million ALPS Clean Energy ETF and the US$177 million First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund, which have gained almost 11 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively.Tesla rallied another 19 per cent on Tuesday, surpassing US$900 per share for the first time. The surge prompted Citron Research to say that even Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk would short the electric-car maker’s shares at this level.While CFRA Research is among the shops anticipating Tesla shares to pull back, highly bullish active managers aren’t likely to sell, according to Todd Rosenbluth, the firm’s director of ETF research.“The challenge is some of the strategies that own high stakes is Tesla are actively managed and their conviction remains quite high,” said Rosenbluth. “In theory, the active managers could choose to pare back, but I don’t think that’s the case.” Bloomberg.com"

New Street highlighted “limited sources of further” stock appreciation over the next year as the reason behind the downgrade.“We see 2020 playing out fine, but it is largely expected,” the analysts wrote in a research note. The group highlighted risks including a potential miss on gross margins for the first three months of 2020, and the launch of Tesla’s Model Y disrupting demand for its Model 3. They also cited the end of a squeeze on short investors, although short interest strategists have yet to call it a squeeze.“Everyone is anticipating a dramatic Tesla short squeeze, but it is more likely to be a continuous slow decline in shares shorted rather than a sudden abrupt plunge,” S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky wrote in a research note. The company remains the largest short in the domestic market with more than US$15.8 billion bet against it, Dusaniwsky’s research shows.Tesla climbed 15 per cent to US$896 per share at 8:26 a.m. in New York. That sets the stock up to more than double its closing price from where it stood at US$418.33 on Dec. 31.It’s worth pointing out that Ferragu boosted the firm’s price target to US$800 from US$530 just last week after the company’s blowout quarterly earnings results. Despite the stock’s more than 110% rally this year, it remains one of the most divisive on Wall Street with nine analysts recommending investors buy shares compared to 10 hold ratings and 18 sell-equivalents.

This equates to 10 per cent or fewer of eligible customers, he wrote, a take rate he called “surprisingly low.” Apple hasn’t disclosed subscriber numbers for the TV+ service.Sacconaghi speculated that Apple TV+ may be “failing to resonate with customers, perhaps due to its limited content offerings.” Unlike other streaming services such as Netflix Inc. or Amazon Prime, which offer reruns to well-known content, Apple only offers original shows on its service, with “The Morning Show” being the most high profile. Meanwhile, Walt Disney’s Disney+ service has benefited from the company’s pool of well-known intellectual property, like “Star Wars” and Marvel.

In December, an expert panel hosted by UBS said that Apple TV+ “needs a mega-hit original series to ultimately retain subscribers,” adding that the company “may likely have to ultimately also acquire an asset with a big backlog of catalog content — most of which will be very expensive at this point.”Bernstein suggested other reasons why Apple TV+ may not have caught on in terms of subscribers. It could be that Apple “hasn’t been able to effectively promote TV+,” Sacconaghi wrote, encouraging the company “to more directly leverage its 1.5B device installed base.” He also reflected that the company may be conservatively estimating the take rate or “deliberately scaling its promotions of TV+ slowly to mitigate the negative accounting impact.”In any case, he added, investors should “closely monitor the adoption of TV+ going forward,” as the take rate will “provide some indication of potential acceptance of the service, as well as Apple’s ability to successfully launch meaningful new revenue-generating services.”Bernstein has a market-perform rating and US$300 price target on the stock. Sacconaghi wrote that he was “torn” about its prospects, as the valuation is “off the charts vs. history, with increasingly high expectations.”Shares of Apple are up nearly 80 per cent from a June low, although it has recently dropped on concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in China.Apple’s services business grew less than expected in the first-quarter results, in a performance that was seen as disappointing. While the magnitude of the miss was “slight,” Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral wrote, the business is “key to the [long-term] bull thesis and is often cited as a driver of multiple expansion.”The services business generated more than US$46 billion in revenue over 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg; this represents nearly 18 per cent of overall revenue. Despite uncertainty related to the TV+ business and the overall pace of growth at the division, analysts still see rapid growth for services revenue. Last month, Evercore ISI wrote that it was “an underappreciated growth lever,” and that services revenue could grow above US$100 billion by the end of Apple’s 2024 fiscal year.Bloomberg.com"

In meetings, the Amazon.com Inc. chief expressed envy for how Musk had pitted five Western states against one another in a bidding war for thousands of manufacturing jobs; he wondered why Amazon was okay with accepting comparatively trifling incentives. It was a theme Bezos returned to often, according to four people privy to his thinking. Then in 2017, an Amazon executive sent around a congratulatory email lauding his team for landing US$40 million in government incentives to build a US$1.5 billion air hub near Cincinnati. The paltry sum irked Bezos, the people say, and made him even more determined to try something new.And so, when Amazon launched a bakeoff for a second headquarters in September 2017, the company made plain that it was looking for government handouts in exchange for a pledge to invest US$5 billion and hire 50,000 people. The splashy reality-television-style contest generated breathless media coverage, attracted fawning bids from 238 cities across North America and ended with Amazon deciding to split the so-called HQ2 between New York and Virginia. Then progressive politicians attacked the US$3 billion in incentives offered by New York, and Bezos pulled out. Amazon was widely ridiculed for its failure to court New York politicians. To understand why that happened, Bloomberg interviewed 12 people familiar with Amazon’s effort. Their story, outlined here for the first time, depicts a team that became the victim of its own hubris. Bezos’s frustration with what he deemed meagre government largess prompted executives to scrap lessons learned through the years in favour of an unapologetic appeal for tax breaks and other incentives.

Employees with experience negotiating deals around the country anticipated problems, but their red flags were ignored by those eager to please Bezos with a new playbook for a big win. Secretive and walled off from the rest of the company, according to people familiar with the situation, the HQ2 team members marinated in the headlines and hoopla and persuaded themselves Amazon would be welcomed anywhere.That blinkered assumption continues to resonate today, not least among city officials across the continent who felt manipulated by Amazon, according to people familiar with their thinking. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers is considering a non-aggression pact to halt the kind of tax-incentive bidding war unleashed during the HQ2 process. “This entire thing was an ego exercise that blew up in Jeff Bezos’s face,” says one of the people.In an emailed statement, Amazon said the company has invested US$270 billion in 40 states and created more than 500,000 jobs with competitive wages, benefits and employee training. “We partner with hundreds of communities across the country to bring them new jobs and investment. Like many other companies, we are eligible to access incentive programs created and regulated by cities and states to attract new investors — as they know that these investments pay a long-term dividend in the form of jobs, new economic opportunity, and incremental tax revenue.”This entire thing was an ego exercise that blew up in Jeff Bezos's face 
 
For years, Amazon’s economic development team followed a well-trod process, dubbed the “welcome wagon” internally and developed as the company began building warehouses in towns and cities around the U.S. To head off concerns about traffic, working conditions and competition with local mom-and-pop shops, executives hosted informational meetings, inviting residents and stakeholders to ask questions. Sometimes, Amazon arranged for officials to travel to other cities to see its warehouses first-hand and speak with employees and local leaders. All the while, the public-relations team cultivated relationships with advocates willing to tell the media why they favoured the project.Windsor, Connecticut, Mayor Don Trinks recalls how Amazon eased anxieties in his town near Hartford before opening a warehouse there in 2016. When news of the project broke, residents panicked about truck traffic. Amazon hosted meetings around town and answered every question. “The public perception was a big company like Amazon will come in and steamroll our little town, but nothing could’ve been further from the truth,” says Trinks, who has been mayor for almost 20 years and owns a small restaurant. “Their outreach was very impressive. They took the hard questions and jumped right in front of everything.”

Bezos decided the HQ2 process would be handled differently. It wasn’t just Musk’s Nevada experience that got him fixated on extracting more government subsidies. He had also watched Boeing Co. win an US$8.7-billion handout from Washington state in 2013 — only to scale back its workforce over the next several years. Meanwhile, Amazon was getting no state money despite hiring thousands of people and was tangling with Seattle City Council, which blamed the company for making the city too expensive. Besides angling for government generosity for HQ2, Bezos also told his team to seek US$1 billion in breaks for other Amazon projects, according to someone familiar with the situation. The economic development team had failed to meet its financial targets in each of the previous several years, the person says. (The Wall Street Journal first reported the US$1 billion target.) An Amazon spokeswoman disputed that the company has goals for government incentives.The notion of a second headquarters grew out of the realization that, over the years, Amazon had opened satellite offices around the country with little rhyme or reason, according to a person close to the process. Bezos’s senior executives decided it would be better to pick one location that could absorb headcount needs for the next decade. Amazon had been quietly scouting cities and had already identified 25 that could accommodate about 20,000 employees, according to the people.  The company could have whittled down that list and negotiated with select finalists. Instead, Bezos pushed for the bakeoff. Musk had enticed five states into a bidding war; Bezos would open his contest to all of North America, even if putting a second HQ in Canada or Columbus, Ohio, was unlikely.A team that included real estate chief John Schoettler drew up a request for proposals, highlighting such must-haves as an airport with direct flights to Seattle and good universities. The word “incentive” was used 21 times. Some team members cringed, worried that Amazon would come across as tone-deaf given Bezos’s wealth, not to mention triggering a national debate over income inequality. They knew officials would offer tax breaks regardless. Demanding them left Amazon exposed to accusations of corporate greed.But the naysayers were quickly hushed and sent to work on other projects. The remaining members of the team believed any fallout would be short-lived and overshadowed by the sheer size of Amazon’s investment.Led by public policy chief Brian Huseman and economic development director Holly Sullivan, the HQ2 team commandeered a small Washington office and retreated behind a wall of secrecy. The windows were blacked out, and Huseman warned non-team members that anyone entering the room would be punished, according to one of the people. Information was tightly controlled to prevent leaks.One evening in January 2018, members of the team got an email ordering them to report to the office early the next morning. It was time to trim the list of more than 200 HQ2 contenders. Huseman reminded the team that anyone leaking information to the media would be identified and fired. They each got a stack of cities to call and instructions to let the officials down gently by telling them they had submitted an enticing proposal. Much like job applicants, the deflated officials thanked Amazon for being considered and fished for clues as to why they didn’t make the cut, according to someone who made the calls.The 20 finalists largely overlapped with the existing list of 25 potential locations, according to people familiar with the matter. Leaving in smaller cities like Indianapolis and Columbus, even though few team members took them seriously, helped Amazon send a message that all cities had a chance, according to one of the people involved on the project. Maintaining the competitive frenzy took priority over further narrowing the list, which would have let Amazon focus on relationships. The prevailing sentiment inside the HQ2 team after cutting hundreds of communities: that was tough, but necessary. They were mostly relieved to be one step closer to completing the search and celebrated with beer and wine in the kitchen of the Washington office.Despite Amazon’s efforts to keep the operation contained internally, the fallout spilled into other departments. City and state officials privately complained to their Amazon contacts that the exercise was a tremendous waste of public resources, according to a person who received the complaints. Mayors and governors said they had other businesses genuinely interested in their cities and states and lamented that Amazon was stringing the entire continent along, the person said.Mayors and governors ... lamented that Amazon was stringing the entire continent along 
 
The frustration spread beyond North America after Amazon’s bid for big tax breaks became international news. One Amazon executive warned that officials in Europe where the company was trying to expand were asking how long it would be before Bezos asked them for tax breaks as well. These concerns made their way up the ranks to Amazon Web Services chief Andy Jassy, according to a person familiar with the matter.In September 2018, executives decided to split the new headquarters between New York and Virginia. Before going public, Amazon quietly  tied up real estate deals and government agreements in the two locations, mindful that local real estate prices could spike if the media got wind of it. The prioritization of secrecy over building alliances proved fatal in New York. When the news finally leaked, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer’s phone lit up. Van Bramer was supportive of efforts to draw Amazon, but quickly became an opponent once he realized that Amazon, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio had cut him and other local officials out of the process. Van Bramer sought clarity from the governor and mayor but says he was ghosted and misled. His ire increased upon learning that there were no plans to seek city council approval.“I was angry because something so massively important had been decided and no one had bothered to tell local elected officials or anyone else who had a big stake in this,” Van Bramer says. “We had been excluded from the process.”He was further incensed upon learning of the subsidies Amazon would receive, including a US$500-million grant to help pay for the new headquarters. That week, Van Bramer travelled to Puerto Rico, where he bumped into New York State Senator Michael Gianaris in the lobby of the El San Juan Hotel. Over a Medalla  beer, they vented and agreed to fight the project. The pair got help from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has long considered Amazon’s online shopping business a threat to its members. Fuelling the tension was a new Amazon warehouse in Staten Island where some workers wanted to organize.Amazon representatives sought meetings with city and state officials, but Gianaris declined and Van Bramer met with them only once, according to an Amazon executive familiar with the process. This person says Amazon didn’t involve City Council because getting approval would have taken years and because other major projects such as the Hudson Yards redevelopment had gone through the state. Moreover, this person says, Amazon representatives received a warm welcome during a site visit.The extent of the hostility didn’t reveal itself until Huseman appeared before the city council in December 2018, where he was jeered and interrupted. Back in Seattle, Amazonians watched the livestream in disbelief, texting one another about how Huseman came off as robotic, inauthentic and out of touch. Huseman fell back on job figures and dollar signs but there wasn’t enough to humanize the project. The ultimate breaking point came when he said the company wouldn’t remain neutral if employees tried to organize unions. He appeared oblivious to the political climate in New York, where the children of union janitors and labourers get elected to run the city. Amazon’s negotiating strategy, internally summarized as “F*** you. We’re Amazon,” had met its match.

The beginning of the end came when Gianaris was recommended for a seat on the state’s Public Authorities Control Board, which had the power to influence the deal. Gianaris was never confirmed for the seat, but his nomination was a game changer. Gianaris says he requested the appointment because “the Amazon project was in my district, and I saw this as the only tool available to have any real input into what was about to go down.”There were some last-minute meetings to attempt to bridge the divide and even some whispers that Amazon had capitulated and agreed to remain neutral in employee union campaigns. Amazon saved the breakup news for Valentine’s Day, saying that “a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project.”Looking back, some Amazon employees say they shouldn’t have blindly assumed that Amazon would be welcomed everywhere, but still see signs of success in the 25,000 jobs to come in Virginia and 5,000 in Nashville, Tennessee. Others involved in the process say executives tied their hands by prioritizing secrecy over relationship-building. “Negotiating incentives is easy,” one says. “What’s hard is winning hearts and minds and Amazon didn’t do anything to win hearts and minds.”Still, Bezos can take comfort from one aspect of the HQ2 saga. Thanks to US$762 million in incentives from Virginia, according to the watchdog group Good Jobs First, Amazon is just US$100 million shy of the US$2.4 billion Tesla has amassed in handouts.Bloomberg.com"

All but 162 of the almost 4,000 stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen recorded losses, with about 90 per cent dropping the maximum allowed by the country’s exchanges. Health-care shares comprised most of Monday’s gainers on speculation they will benefit from the virus outbreak.“The sell-off was so quick and intense,” said Li Changmin, managing director at Snowball Wealth in Guangzhou. “We’ll be busy dealing with risk controls and even liquidation pressure if stocks keep falling.”

While it was always going to be brutal for China’s US$7.5 trillion stock market as investors caught up with losses worldwide, Monday’s declines were particularly severe. The CSI 300 Index sank as much as 9.1 per cent — a slump rarely seen in its almost 15-year history. The huge number of stocks trading limit down means it could take days for investors to execute their orders, prolonging the sell-off.“I was anxious before the market opened, and had made plans on what to sell and by how much last Friday,” said Bruce Yu, a fund manager with Franklin Templeton SinoAm Securities Investment Management Inc. in Taipei. “Some of my trades weren’t made today — we’ll see if we can sell them tomorrow.”Making matters even more difficult for mainland-based traders was that many couldn’t trade from the office, and some had to do it with a reduced working force. Some of the country’s largest cities — including Shanghai — extended the Lunar New Year holiday until the end of the week, while Beijing’s government encouraged residents to work from home.It was the first chance mainland investors had since Jan. 23 to trade, due to the extended Lunar New Break. Officials urged investors to evaluate objectively the impact of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 360 and spread to more than 17,000 people in China alone.The sell-off was widespread on Monday: commodity futures from iron ore to crude sank by the daily limit, and the yuan weakened past a key level against the dollar.Fund managers hit the phones to calm investors, seeking to avoid the kind of redemptions and forced selling seen as recently as 2018. China’s securities regulator took steps to support the stock market, telling some brokerages that their proprietary traders aren’t allowed to be net sellers of equities this week, according to people familiar with the matter.“My biggest concern was that investors would rush to redeem their holdings in private and mutual funds,” said Jiang Liangqing, a money manager at Ruisen Capital Management in Beijing whose team is working from home across China. “A key task for us is to reassure our fund holders and ask them to stay calm.”Some avoided the market altogether, deciding there was no point trying to get orders through if it meant selling at such a deep discount.“I had a look at stocks at the open, grabbed my fishing pole right after and left home,” said Yin Ming, Shanghai-based vice president of investment firm Baptized Capital. “What else can you do? I knew the market would be ugly today but didn’t expect a drop of this magnitude.”Others were brave enough to buy, keeping their cool as China attempted to stem the panic. The central bank took its first concrete steps to cushion the economy and plunging markets from the blow of the coronavirus, providing short-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate it charges for the money. Investors purchased US$2.6 billion worth of onshore stocks on Monday through exchange links with Hong Kong, the second-largest amount on record.“Buying is all I’m doing,” said Hou Anyang, a partner at Shenzhen Frontsea Asset Management, who was one of four working Monday out of a team of 20. “I’ve been through the circuit-breaker of 2016 and other big routs — as a professional investor, this is a huge opportunity.” Bloomberg.com"

The company was spending far more than it was generating in revenue and suffered from an over-dependence on Neumann, who took out loans from WeWork as it paid him rent on buildings he owned.

She was first tested negative, but a second test confirmed the virus.Uncertainty about the severity and duration of the outbreak has left economists and analysts making best-guess estimates.

For equities, the declines are likely to be exacerbated by the amount of leverage in the market. That could create a downward spiral where steep losses become steeper with traders facing margin calls.

Chairman Richard Baker was in talks about selling the Canadian retailer’s stake in its European business when he started to formulate his own plan to take the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue private, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.The document offers a look into Baker’s role in the sale of Hudson’s Bay’s stake in a joint venture with Signa Holding GmbH that operates German department stores, as well as his subsequent interactions with the board. Proceeds from the Signa deal were needed to help secure financing for the take-private deal, which will be voted on by shareholders next month.The additional disclosure was mandated by the Ontario Securities Commission in a ruling last month before Baker and his partners could proceed with their efforts to acquire the remainder of the company they didn’t already own.

Hudson’s Bay Co shares shoot up 9% after Richard Baker sweetens bid
It illustrates how Baker and his partners moved forward amid a landscape complicated by the declining fortunes of department stores and intense scrutiny from minority investors. Baker and his partners say the deal will give the company greater flexibility to adapt as consumers migrate away from department stores and to online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc.The Baker group sweetened its bid this month to roughly $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) and reached a truce with investor Catalyst Capital Group, which had opposed the deal’s original terms and filed a complaint with regulators. At the time, Catalyst voiced concerns about the process, including Baker’s interactions with the board. The new proposal will go to a shareholder vote on Feb. 27.Parallel TalksAccording to the filing, Baker was part of a group of Hudson’s Bay representatives that began exploratory talks to sell the Canadian retailer’s remaining 50 per cent stake in its venture with Signa during February of last year. Shortly after those discussions began, Baker started talks of his own with other Hudson’s Bay shareholders about potentially using some of the proceeds from the sale to help take the retailer private.Baker and his partners determined that without the proceeds from the deal with Signa, they would unlikely be able to raise the necessary debt to take Hudson’s Bay private.In March, Baker informed the board’s lead director, David Leith, of his plans to explore taking Hudson’s Bay private. Leith agreed to share limited financial information to Baker and his partners at that time on a confidential basis before informing other board members the following day.A special committee of the board was then established to review the Signa deal and other possible transactions. The committee did not include Baker or fellow executive, Ian Putnam, who was part of the group trying to take the company private, the document shows.“While the special committee was aware that any privatization proposal, if received, would be conditional on the Signa transactions, the Signa transactions were not conditional on a privatization transaction proceeding,” the filing states.The filing also shows how much Baker, his fellow board members, and management will earn through the sale of their options in the deal. The board will make roughly US$26.6 million from the sale, including US$8.7 million for Baker and US$10.2 million for Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes. Baker and the other conflicted directors will roll over their stake in the privatization, the document shows.Bloomberg.com"

CAPP attributes the expected gain to tax cuts implemented by Alberta’s new government, an easing of the province’s output limits and efforts in neighbouring Saskatchewan to boost output.“It has been a tough five years, and Canada has not fared well at a time when global demand continues to rise,” CAPP Chief Executive Officer Tim McMillan said in an interview. “It has taken some hard work, especially at the provincial level, to change the global view and put Canada back in a position where it can start to attract appropriate levels of capital again.”

Expenditures for Canada’s oil and natural gas sector as a whole may increase 5.4 per cent to $37 billion. Outside the oilsands, spending is projected to rise 4.1 per cent to $25.4 billion.The additional $2 billion in capital spending this year will create or sustain about 11,800 direct and indirect jobs across Canada, the organization projected. About 8,100 of those jobs will be in Alberta, which has struggled with elevated unemployment since the 2014 price crash.Even with this year’s increase, the industry is still a long way from its headiest days. The projected oil-sands spending for 2020 is about one-third of the peak of $33.9 billion in 2014, according to CAPP figures.“In business terms, the spending increase is important enough to recognize,” McMillan said. “But just as important, it’s the changing of the trajectory from consistently losing capital investment to turning that around.”Bloomberg.com"

The phenomenon has been dubbed “hipsturbia.”“Downtown Toronto is going to continue to thrive, but I think subway connected, suburban-urban locations are going to see a bit of a rebound in the next three to five years,” Sean Menkes, director of office and retail at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd. 
Oxford and AIMCo target Mississauga to develop 'largest mixed-use downtown development' in Canada
Rich, aging baby boomers will make it even harder for millennials to buy homes over next 10 years
Millennials’ shift to the suburbs will drive up Canadian home prices next year, Royal LePage says
Menkes is working with public-pension manager British Columbia Investment Management Corp. on two projects in Vaughan, a suburb northwest of Toronto. Festival, a four-tower community with 85,000 square feet of retail, will follow last year’s launch of Mobilio. Both are located around Vaughan’s new transit-oriented city centre.West of Toronto in Mississauga, Oxford Properties Group and Alberta Investment Management Corp. unveiled plans this month to turn 130 acres near a shopping mall into the “Square One District,” an 18 million-square-foot neighbourhood for 35,000 people that they call the largest mixed-use development in Canadian history. The plan will see a swath of parking lots remade into a community with 37 towers, more than 18,000 residential units, office and retail space.Making a big, high-density bet in otherwise low-density suburbs can be risky. Real estate history is replete with boom-bust cycles in which developers piled into new markets too quickly. Empty office towers dubbed “see-through buildings” dotted Houston and Dallas for years after the twin collapses of the oil and savings-and-loan industries in the 1980s.We're bringing what we know downtown and bringing it to the suburbsJared Menkes 
 
In Toronto, builders are responding to a years-long surge in Toronto home prices, driven by an influx of immigrants and the city’s booming tech and financial-services sectors. First-time buyers are finding it increasingly difficult to get a foot in the door.PwC and the Urban Land Institute identified hipsturbias as one of the emerging real estate trends for 2020. Linked by public transit to 24-hour cities such as New York, San Francisco and Chicago, they have their own self-contained residential, office and entertainment districts.Evanston, Illinois is one example, with Northwestern University providing a constant supply of young adults — “the lifeblood of hipsturbias,” according to the report. Lake Michigan beaches, rooftop bars and rail access to the Chicago Loop help round out the elements of “coolness” in one of the Midwest’s oldest suburbs, PwC said.“It’s a huge trend in the U.S. and it’s exactly what we’ve been planning for the last few years up in Vaughan,” said Jared Menkes, executive vice president of high-rise residential for the family-owned firm. “We’re bringing what we know downtown and bringing it to the suburbs.”Eastern WaterfrontHomebuyers aren’t the only ones finding downtown Toronto expensive. With land prices and construction costs soaring and the permitting process beset by delays, developers are also seeking cheaper and easier projects farther afield.Menkes has found success with previous real estate hunches. The 65-year-old firm, run by the late founder’s three sons and four grandsons, was a catalyst in extending Toronto’s downtown toward Lake Ontario to what’s now known as the South Core.“We’re midway through a 20-year development cycle of our own where we’ll deliver just about 8 million square feet on the waterfront,” Sean Menkes said.

The rollback marks a rare setback for the plant-based meat maker, which currently has partnerships with Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s and Dunkin’ Donuts in the U.S., and recently announced an expansion of its partnership with Subway in Canada to begin serving meatball subs nationwide.A Beyond Meat spokesperson confirmed this was a limited time offer and the companies may work together in the future.

The producer asked the regulator to split its review of the proposal into two parts, with the first addressing whether the conversion should even be allowed.The opposition signals that Enbridge hasn’t yet sold some producers on its plan, which already has been delayed after drillers persuaded regulators to a halt a bidding process for space on the line. That halt required Enbridge to submit its full plan for review by regulators last month, and Canadian Natural is now asking the CER to reject it outright.

“The proposed conversion of the Mainline from common carriage to contract carriage is unprecedented and inconsistent with the common carriage obligations established in the CER Act,” Calgary-based Canadian Natural said in the filing.Enbridge said in an emailed statement it’s reviewing the filing submitted by Canadian Natural and will provide a response to CER by Feb. 7, adding that its proposal has received support from companies representing over 70 per cent of the Mainline’s current throughput. The pipeline operator has previously said its proposal to the CER represents 18 months of discussions with a variety of shippers and is the best compromise of their competing views.Enbridge is seeking to be able to lock customers on the Mainline into contracts for as long as 20 years, a shift from the current system in which space is allocated on a monthly basis. The company has said long-term contracts will provide shippers with certainty on tolls and market access.The Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, which represents mostly small- and mid-sized producers, also asked the CER on Tuesday to split the review process in two. The regulator should address other matters in Enbridge’s application, such as tolls, only once the fundamental issue of a switch to contract service is decided.“The Enbridge Application is proposing a monumental change that has the potential to change the face of Canadian oil markets for decades,” EPAC President Tristan Goodman said in its filing. “Therefore, the preliminary issue of the appropriateness of converting the Enbridge Mainline to firm service should be carefully considered as a threshold question by a process that is efficient, inclusive and consistent with the public interest.”Bloomberg.com"
"{'id': 'fp-bloomberg-news', 'name': 'Bloomberg News From FP'}",Shelly Hagan and Doug Alexander,Canada's strong job market is being fuelled by men,"More than 193,000 males took new jobs in Canada last year, almost double the number of females",https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/as-u-s-men-lag-in-job-market-their-canadian-peers-win-big,https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/constructioin.jpg,"January 29, 2020 10:08 AM EST","Canada’s job market has been firing on all cylinders but it’s been especially strong for men.More than 193,000 males took new jobs in Canada last year, almost double the number of females, pushing the unemployment rate for men below 6 per cent for the first time since records began in 1976. The figures mark a divergence from the U.S., where women eclipsed men as the majority of jobholders.The fastest pace of immigration in the Group of Seven is a big factor behind the trend in Canada, spurring a housing boom that’s pushing up demand for everything from plumbers to electricians. A fast-track visa process is also pulling in workers to the male-dominated field of technology, while male immigrants are more likely than women to work outside the home. 
Canada’s economy has ‘free money lying on the sidewalk’ and nobody is picking it up
Canada’s economy just had its second-best year for jobs since 2007
Ignore the headlines, Canada’s labour market remains remarkably strong
Canada notched another solid year of job gains in 2019, with the unemployment rate hovering near a four-decade low of 5.6 per cent. The female unemployment rate dipped even lower than men, reaching a record 4.9 per cent in May but the big job gains have skewed male.Jared Menkes, executive vice president at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd., said finding enough labour is a constant source of angst. Central Toronto posted the fastest-growing population in North America last year with a dozen office buildings and countless condos under construction, along with 25 light rail stations, hospitals and all sorts of infrastructure work.“We are short actual labour, whether it’s a crane operator, whether it’s drywallers, electricians, plumbers, drivers,” Menkes said. “We’re short truck drivers, architects, consultants.”Ontario LeadsTo be sure, the headline figures mask stark regional disparities that underscore the difficulties Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing. Much of the job creation has been in central Canada while parts of the West struggle with a slump in the energy sector that has gutted thousands of jobs. Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau’s Liberals push to reduce Canada’s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 — sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O’Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario’s resurgence.“There’s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don’t know what they’re doing in life,” said O’Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto’s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “I don’t think since this job started I’ve worked less than a 60-hour week.”

Just under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has also clamped down on visas for the high-tech sector, a source of jobs growth in Canada.Male immigrants are more likely to participate in the workforce than women, who often face additional barriers, according to Parisa Mahboubi, a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto.“Generally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,” Mahboubi said. “However, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.”Tech ManiaThe broad-ranging category of “professional, scientific and technical services,” which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn’t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that’s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you’re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, managing director at hireVouch 
 
Patrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can’t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.“Almost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,” he said. “It’s probably the hardest time if you’re an employer, but if you’re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.”OutlookRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.“A growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can’t find work,” Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O’Neill, the crane operator, doesn’t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.“She’s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,” he said. “It’s good for me, too. I’m young.”Bloomberg.com"

Deferred production costs also grew by US$2.6 billion, clipping the jet’s long-term profit potential, Boeing said in a presentation Wednesday. That’s on top of more than US$9 billion in Max-related costs already disclosed.Adding to the barrage of bad news, Boeing notched its first annual loss last year since 1997, when it shut down assembly lines amid a supplier meltdown. Looking ahead, the company expects “future abnormal costs” of about US$4 billion as it slowly restarts Max production.

		“I think he’s trying to grab all the bad news that he can, put it in the current period and then get on with life,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said before earnings were announced.Boeing’s troubles went well beyond the Max in a quarterly earnings report that showed sales and profit plunging because of the crisis. In one small bright spot, however, the company burned US$2.67 billion in free cash, which was less than expected by analysts.“We recognize we have a lot of work to do,” Calhoun said in a statement. He said the planemaker had the financial liquidity to follow a “disciplined recovery process” and is committed to “restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public.”The Chicago-based manufacturer confirmed a Bloomberg News report last week that it plans a further cut in production of the 787 Dreamliner, to 10 a month early next year. And Boeing set aside funds for an additional orbital flight in case NASA requires the mission after the company’s Starliner spacecraft missed a rendezvous with the International Space Station last month.Boeing climbed 1.9% to US$322.50 ahead of regular trading in New York. Through Tuesday, the shares had fallen 25% since an Ethiopian Airlines jet slammed into a field March 10, killing all on board and plunging Boeing into one of the worst crises of the modern jet era. That crash came less than five months after a Lion Air jet went down off the coast of Indonesia. Bloomberg.com"

The test is scheduled to run until Feb. 23 or while supplies last.The trial marks an advance in Beyond Meat’s technology. While eager Atlanta customers last summer were served a product that was ground, formed, breaded and fried, the new offering represents an upgrade — a nugget made to replicate a real cut of breast meat.

“If you look at what we launched with in Atlanta versus what we’re doing today, we all agreed that we need to get that muscle-like structure,” said Ethan Brown, chief executive officer of Beyond Meat, who proceeded to tear open a nugget to show off the interior. “I just can’t stop pulling this apart.”Since Beyond Meat’s initial public offering last May — one of the most successful IPOs of the year — the company has been racking up major fast-food partnerships.Its burgers are found in all U.S. Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurants, and are being tested in McDonald’s in Canada, while its sausages are available at more than 9,000 Dunkin’ locations. The Atlanta test with KFC sold out in less than five hours.Beyond Meat, based in El Segundo, California, isn’t alone in its quest to deliver a less-meaty diet. Impossible Foods Inc. has its soy-based burgers in more than 7,000 Burger Kings nationally, as well as White Castles and Red Robins around the country. Major food companies like Nestle SA and Conagra Brands Inc. are making their own plant-based burgers, too.Over TimeBut the looming question is how long the excitement can last — with consumers and retailers.Earlier this month, amid dropping Impossible Whopper sales, Burger King began a two-for-$6 promotion, almost half the earlier suggested price of US$5.59 per sandwich. And Tim Hortons in Canada has dropped both the Beyond Burger and Beyond breakfast sandwich with faux sausage.Gauging the post-novelty drop-off is part of the test, said Andrea Zahumensky, chief U.S. marketing officer of KFC, a division of Yum!

Link in bio to learn more! A post shared by  Beyond Meat (@beyondmeat) on Aug 26, 2019 at 9:05am PDT“We very specifically have gotten sufficient supply to be able to have this test run for multiple weeks so that we start to really understand what does this product do over time,” Zahumensky said. “Are people going to come back for it? Is it just going to be new people coming in? All of that is going to lead into, what is an acceptable level over time?”There’s another wrinkle to the latest announcement for the booming plant-based industry — one that may disappoint vegans and vegetarians. While the products will be made by Beyond Meat, including having been marinaded and breaded with their flavourings, they will be fried in oil that has been used with KFC chicken.KFC says it will provide full information on its website and train employees to answer questions appropriately.Brown says that while he’s aware of the issues facing Burger King — it’s been sued for claiming the Impossible Whoppers are meat-free when they are cooked on the same grill as beef Whoppers — patrons at Carl’s Jr., which does the same, haven’t complained.“It’s an education process,” Brown said.Bloomberg.com

The Stack and Scoop fields in the Anadarko Basin have faced investor scrutiny and operational challenges that sent a handful of small explorers into bankruptcy. The company is also set to host a tour of its Stack operations Thursday.“We think the focus will be on steps the company has taken to reduce well costs and improve returns to make the play more competitive with other resource plays in North America,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Arun Jayaram in a report. “The company will likely face stiff headwinds ‘selling’ the play to the market given the sharp pullback in activity by industry.”

In his piece, Porter referred to Guaido as “Venezuela’s legitimate president” who “has shown tremendous courage” in asking for help from other nations.“Now we must heed that call and stand with the Venezuelan people,” Porter wrote.Porter urged governments throughout the Americas and Europe to both support Venezuelan refugees and initiate a coordinated effort to identify and seize assets from corrupt regime officials. The proceeds, along with additional aid, should be used to provide financial support to the democratic movement in Venezuela, he wrote.Scotiabank, based in Toronto, does business in more than 30 countries, with significant operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and a focus on on the Pacific Alliance countries of Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru.Porter cited the European Union for having “strongly condemned” Maduro’s regime and supporting Guaido. Closer to home, he praised Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne for showing “tremendous courage and leadership” for “unambiguously condemning the Maduro regime’s abuses.”Bloomberg.com"

In October, Alberta released a budget plan that called for $12.2 billion to be raised in the long-term debt markets for the fiscal year ended March 31 — of which $5.5 billion was remaining as of Tuesday. Ontario, by comparison, completed its $31.6 billion borrowing plan last week, according to Laurentian Bank Securities Inc. data. Meanwhile, Quebec began pre-funding for the following fiscal year in late 2019.Investors demand 10.4 basis points more to hold Alberta’s bonds maturing in September 2029 over similar-duration securities from Ontario due in June of that year, according to Bloomberg Valuation bid prices — that’s the widest since mid-December. The gap was as tight as 6.9 basis points on Aug. 2 before pushing out to as many as 12.2 basis points after the federal election.Alberta had already been playing catch-up to other Canadian provinces, selling $700 million of bonds earlier this month — its first domestic currency debt offering in almost four months. Since that Jan. 14 note sale, Alberta’s bond spreads over those of Ontario and Quebec widened.“We will continue to monitor the domestic and global markets and will borrow when we feel it is in the province’s best interests, not to time the market,” said Goodwin.Bloomberg.com"

Starbucks, McDonald’s Corp. and Domino’s Pizza Inc.: Of the three U.S. restaurant chains, Starbucks is the most exposed to the outbreak, as measured by percentage of worldwide revenue and operating income, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco. “China represents a high growth region and a meaningful contributor to the longer-term global revenue growth goals for all three companies,” DiFrisco said in a note.

Imax Corp.: The Mississauga, Ontario-based company, known for its large-format screen technology, has said it’s delaying movie releases at its theatres in China in the wake of the outbreak. The impact of lost revenue from the Chinese New Year will cost Imax at least US$60 million in global box office sales, according to MKM Partners.

The complaint names Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC, formerly known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, along with co-owners Shkreli and Kevin Mulleady.The allegations are separate from what landed Shkreli behind bars, though the drug at the centre of the case is the same. He’s in prison serving a seven-year sentence for defrauding investors in hedge funds he ran by lying to them about his track record and performance as well as a fraud scheme involving Retrophin Inc., a company he founded in 2011.

Shkreli, who was ousted from Retrophin in 2014, started Turing Pharmaceuticals the following year. While operating the biopharmaceutical business Shkreli acquired a drug called Daraprim, a once-affordable anti-infective for a sometimes-deadly parasitic infection. The FTC and New York claim he then raised the price and used a complex web of contractual restrictions to block generic versions.The defendants “acquired the U.S. rights to Daraprim from the only existing supplier and immediately raised the price from US$17.50 to US$750 per tablet,” according to the complaint. “This massive price hike delivered immediate benefits to defendants.”“We won’t allow ‘Pharma Bros’ to manipulate the market and line their pockets at the expense of vulnerable patients,” James said in a statement.“Mr. Shkreli looks forward to defeating this baseless and unprecedented attempt by the FTC to sue an individual for monopolizing a market,” Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement.Shkreli, who taught himself biology, and his company Turing Pharmaceuticals were among those included in a 2016 U.S. Senate committee report that called for the government to stop a “monopoly business model” used by some drugmakers to raise prices on certain medications.In Washington, the infamously sarcastic Shkreli has remained the face of increasingly high drug costs. President Donald Trump has called the former hedge-fund-manager-turned-drug-executive a “spoiled brat,” while the presidential campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has called him a “poster boy for drug company greed.”Shkreli is scheduled to be released from prison in September 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.

In the process, they’re getting harder to come by.A shortage of the smaller birds derailed the Popeyes challenge to reigning champion Chick-fil-A last summer, and most petite poultry are sold in grocery stores, not in chain restaurants. Now the supply will be further tested as more competitors jump into the fray. McDonald’s Corp., the world’s biggest restaurant chain, is testing new fried-chicken sandwiches in four U.S. cities with the added pop of MSG, a controversial flavour enhancer it says it doesn’t use in its national menu. Wendy’s Co. is going all in, spending US$30 million to beef up its chicken supply chain.

Popeyes is bringing back its crazy popular, sold-out chicken sandwich this Sunday in slam to Chick-fil-A
“Consumers don’t want tough and tasteless big chickens,” said Scott Sechler, owner of poultry producer Bell & Evans. There’s “increasing consumer demand for smaller, premium-quality birds.”Chickens have been the most popular meat in America for a long time. More chicken is devoured in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world — an average of 93.5 pounds per person last year, according to the National Chicken Council. The birds have been getting progressively bigger over the years. Today’s broiler varieties, the ones raised for meat, average more than 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms) each. In 1925, they weighed 2.5 pounds.So how did these fast-food chains so quickly find success with their chicken sandwiches? Birds lighter than 4.25 pounds.Small Is BeautifulThe summer skirmish focused Big Chicken’s attention on the smaller and less plentiful variety. Breasts from wee birds recently reached triple the cost of breasts from a “jumbo” nine-pounder, a historically wide difference, according to Russ Whitman of commodity researcher Urner Barry.When it comes to sandwiches, small is beautiful. Cutting up a bigger portion takes labour, and what does one do with the trim? Restaurants want product that comes ready to go at the right specifications, said David Maloni, executive vice president of analytics at supply-chain consultant ArrowStream.“It’s getting harder and harder to get that” smaller bird, “so they’re paying a premium,” Maloni said. The fast-food chains won’t settle for bigger birds, he said.Consumers don't want tough and tasteless big chickensScott Sechler, owner of poultry producer Bell & Evans 
 
Chick-fil-A total sales at its 2,470 locations rose 13 per cent last year, boosted by the closely held chain’s fried-chicken sandwich, according to Technomic data. The company’s ascendancy led Mark Kalinowski of Kalinowski Equity Research to say that Chick-fil-A poses “the largest competitive threat” to McDonald’s in the U.S.Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the demand for its new sandwich last summer was so overwhelming that it ran through what it thought would be several months of supply in 14 days. It took until November for the company to bring the sandwich back. In the third-quarter of 2019, same-store U.S. Popeyes sales rose 10 per cent to one of the highest levels in two decades.Cheetos SandwichKFC, operated by Yum! Brands Inc., took a hit, with comparable sales dropping last quarter. In October, the chain said its limited-time Cheetos-chicken sandwich didn’t catch on with customers and led to the decline. KFC didn’t respond to requests for comment.McDonald’s and Wendy’s, on the other hand, have been gearing up. Late last year, McDonald’s began testing new chicken sandwiches in a couple hundred restaurants, mostly in Houston, Seattle, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Augusta, Georgia.Like Chick-fil-A, Popeyes and KFC — but not Wendy’s — McDonald’s is adding monosodium glutamate to its sandwich. While MSG is generally safe, according to the Food and Drug Administration, its use is controversial because some people complain of side effects such as headache, numbness and heart palpitations.Tender JuicinessIn 2017, Wendy’s said it was slashing its average chicken size by 20 per cent to improve its “tenderness and juiciness.”“We saw instant feedback from our customers, who told us our sandwiches across the entire chicken lineup were juicier and more tender,” said Liliana Esposito, chief communications officer for the chain.Popeyes and Chick-fil-A declined to comment.The biggest U.S. chicken producers were mum about their supplies of little chickens. Perdue Farms Inc., and Koch Foods Inc. declined to comment. Tyson Foods Inc., parent company of McDonald’s supplier Keystone Foods, also declined to comment.

Jayson Penn, chief executive officer of top producer Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., told investors last year that the market for small birds was “very call-it-tight.” The company’s share price more than doubled in 2019.The little-chicken shortfall looks like it’ll persist. Last year through Nov. 16, the poultry industry raised 10 per cent more birds above 7.76 pounds, considered jumbo, than they did in the same period in 2018, Urner Barry’s Whitman said. The small ones saw a headcount drop of 2 per cent.“Whatever demand growth we might have on smaller breasts, there’s no new supply to meet that demand,” said Will Sawyer, an animal-protein economist at Colorado-based rural lender CoBank ACB. “Everyone wants a bite out of that market.”Bloomberg.com"

The company anticipates pretax savings of as much as US$120 million a year from the changes.The cuts capped a rough year for the maker of everything from Post-it notes to touchscreen displays. The company trimmed its profit forecasts multiple times last year because of escalating trade disputes, headwinds in China and flagging demand in the automotive and electronics markets. Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said 3M is positioning itself to capitalize on an eventual rebound.The shares dropped 2.1 per cent to US$171.87 before regular trading opened in New York. 3M fell 7.4 per cent in 2019, the third-worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.As part of the newly announced restructuring, non-U.S. employees will now report to their business groups rather than the international operations organization, which is being eliminated. Julie Bushman, who oversees international operations, will step down April 1, 3M said.The job cuts prompted a pretax charge of US$134 million in the fourth quarter, the company said. Total adjusted profit fell to US$1.95 a share in the period, trailing the US$2.10 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 2.1 per cent to US$8.1 billion.The transportation and electronics unit continued to weigh on results, with revenue dropping 6.2 per cent. The strain was countered somewhat by the health-care division, a recent bright spot, which boosted sales 25 per cent in the quarter.Roman acknowledged that 3M “continued to manage challenges in certain key end markets,” but said in the statement that the results were still in line with the company’s expectations.China VirusInvestors will look to 3M, which has a broad footprint around the world, for comments on the impact of the deadly coronavirus that has killed more than 100 people in China and is spreading around the globe. Many companies have restricted employee travel and taken other steps in response. 3M has a particularly direct relationship to the crisis as a top maker of protective face masks.The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company took a pretax fourth-quarter writedown of US$214 million for litigation related to PFAS chemicals. The company, along with chemicals- and materials-making peers such as Chemours Co., faces potentially substantial liability from lawsuits over the harmful effects of the so-called “forever chemicals.”3M gave the first peek at its expectations for 2020, saying adjusted profit will be US$9.30 to US$9.75 a share this year. The midpoint of the range trailed the US$9.60 average of analyst estimates. Organic sales, excluding the impact of currency conversions, will rise no more than 2 per cent this year. Bloomberg.com"

Johnson’s choice: Britain faces policy test over Huawei 5G role
High risk vendors, a category which could also include China’s ZTE, which is already banned from the U.K., are also to be “excluded from sensitive geographic locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases.”The recommended 35 per cent cap will be kept under review and could reduce over time, the statement said. BT is already set to switch out Huawei core network components inherited when it bought the EE mobile network in 2016.In a statement, Huawei Vice-President Victor Zhang said it was “reassured” that the U.K. government will let the company keep working with carriers on 5G. “This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future,” he said, committing to build on Huawei’s more than 15 years supplying U.K. telecom operators.The widely-expected announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is a compromise between the outright ban on Huawei sought by the U.S. and the access sought by telecommunication companies. While it ends months of political wrangling, it remains fraught with peril for Johnson as he prepares to end 47 years of European Union membership for the U.K.The Confederation of British Industry, the leading business lobby in the country, said “this solution appears a sensible compromise that gives the UK access to cutting-edge technology, whilst building in appropriate checks and balances around security.”A key pillar of Johnson’s vision for a future outside the world’s richest single market is a trade deal with the U.S. and the Huawei licence risks setting up a clash with President Donald Trump.By curbing Huawei’s access but still allowing the supplier to play a role in 5G, British officials are betting they can manage any security risks at home and still maintain intelligence-sharing ties with the U.S. and other allies.Johnson discussed Huawei in a phone call with Trump on Friday, though his remarks on Monday suggested he wasn’t swayed by the push for a total ban. The prime minister said the U.K. could have the best of both worlds: retaining access to the best technology while protecting the data of consumers. British security services deem the risks manageable.For the U.K. timing of its announcement is particularly sensitive. U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who had warned Johnson’s predecessor not to “wobble” on the issue, is due to visit on Wednesday. Bloomberg.com"

They also owned properties in Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas and the Caribbean and a professional baseball team based in Martinez, California, northeast of San Francisco, authorities said.Earlier this year, the U.S. Marshals Service held an auction for about 150 luxury cars seized from the Carpoffs, including a 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am once owned by Burt Reynolds. Bloomberg.com"

Today, it’s trading under US$10 a pound following a quadrupling of supply from 2018 to 2019.Meanwhile, the CBD consumer market remains limited as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to prohibit the extract in food or dietary supplements, although many sellers ignore that mandate. CBD is legal in other uses, such as topicals, as long as it contains less than 0.3 per cent THC, the cannabis compound that gets you high. 
Big retailers could shy away from CBD as FDA’s unease over safety of the cannabis compound grows
Hemp’s first year as a commercial crop is turning into a disaster with billions rotting on farms
In the U.S., there’s no limit to how much CBD can be added to food. But an FDA review may change that
“Every way you slice it, the physical demand for the CBD market is much, much smaller” than the supply, Lerner said in an interview. “I’m a little surprised that retail prices have not started to come down yet. There’s so much competition.”Lerner, a former Cargill trader, founded PanXchange in 2011. It started as a trading platform and benchmark pricing service for commodities in East Africa, then expanded into the U.S. via the specialty sand market for oil and gas. PanXchange launched the hemp industry’s first suite of benchmark prices in January 2019, one month after the U.S. farm bill legalized the plant, and added a trading platform in August.Today, the hemp market is “rife with desperate sellers and opportunist buyers,” Lerner said in her December analysis of the industry. She looked at three different measures of potential CBD demand and found in each case that farmers are growing far more hemp than the industry needs.Every way you slice it, the physical demand for the CBD market is much, much smaller than the supplyJulie Lerner 
 
For example, Lerner estimated that Charlotte’s Web Holdings Inc., the largest publicly traded CBD company, needed less than 500 acres of hemp to service an estimated US$95 million of sales in 2019. Assuming Charlotte’s Web accounts for approximately 2.4 per cent of the US$4 billion U.S. CBD market, that means about 20,000 acres of hemp are needed in total.Instead, Lerner estimated that approximately 115,000 acres were harvested in 2019. And it’s only going to get worse.“We are hearing that despite the losses people have had this year, they’re still going to increase plantings, and you have Texas, Florida, Wyoming and a bunch of late-comers that are just starting this crop year,” she said.Lerner predicted that industrial demand for hemp will eventually dwarf the CBD market, but that won’t happen until prices drop even more.“It’s a little bit chicken and egg,” she said. “There won’t be demand for it until prices drop, and people won’t be planting for the industrial fibre market until there’s huge demand for it, so we’ve got to get over that hump first.”Cannabis PricesMeanwhile, U.S. prices for cannabis also fell in most states and categories in 2019 — the opposite of the trend seen north of the border.An analysis by wholesale cannabis marketplace LeafLink found that statewide pricing across categories fell in every legal state except Washington and Oregon. Prices also dropped in all categories except for edibles and ingestibles.Notably, prices for smokable flower dropped 8 per cent nationwide, with California prices falling 21 per cent and Oregon tumbling 24 per cent. “This is likely due to the proliferation of non-flower related products as these two markets reach maturity,” LeafLink said in its report.Despite the price increases in 2019, Washington remained the cheapest state to buy cannabis due to “product over-saturation,” LeafLink said. The most expensive state is Alaska, with its “exceptionally high logistics and shipping costs.”Bloomberg.com"

Fears that China has failed to contain the pneumonia-like virus — which has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 — is spurring caution at the start of a week jam-packed with earnings. And such is the nervousness over the severity of the disease that money markets brought forward bets for a U.S. Fed interest-rate cut by a month to November.“This is now a sell first, ask questions later situation,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty — no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy. China is the biggest driver of global growth, so this couldn’t have started in a worse place.”As global stocks sell off, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists say this actually could end up a buying opportunity. They retained a constructive view on world equities, adding that in the past, the more stocks have fallen on similar fears, the more they have rebounded later. Both the S&P 500 and MSCI All-Country World Index surged to records this month as 2020 started on a jubilant note amid optimism over the U.S.-China trade deal.“We thought the markets were overdue for a pullback,” Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg TV. “Valuations are extremely stretched right now and positioning is extremely euphoric. We’ve said that if the right catalyst came along, markets would be ripe for a pullback.”Here are some events to watch out for this week:Tech giants Apple, SAP, Facebook, Samsung and South Korean chip maker SK Hynix announce earnings, as do Boeing, International Paper, GE, United Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, Unilever, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron. The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump continues in Washington Monday. Fed policy makers are expected to open 2020 the same way they closed 2019 — by holding interest rates steady Wednesday.

The impact on Canada, which is a major oil producer, could be large even if the country somehow managed to evade any global pandemic, through the impact of a slowdown in China on commodity prices.The latest respiratory virus outbreak is reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. Toronto had the most deaths from the illness outside Asia and tourism dropped, stunting Canada’s economic growth.

‘A law unto itself’: Limiting fallout of coronavirus will depend on countering public panic
“China’s role in the world economy and as a driver of commodity prices has only grown now versus 2003,” Derek Holt, an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by email. “So the indirect exposure of the Canadian economy to the impact of the coronavirus on China’s economy could be higher today than the indirect impact of SARS in 2003.”The economy barely eked out any growth in the fourth quarter last year, prompting the Bank of Canada to acknowledge Wednesday that it may need to lower interest rates. The central bank is projecting annualized growth of 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2019, the lowest quarterly growth in three years. The expansion is seen rebounding to 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, and close to 2 per cent later in 2020, but that outlook would be put into jeopardy by a major global pandemic.“What would a coronavirus shock do to the BoC’s policy moves? It’s obviously getting a bit premature, but it only reinforces easing expectations,” Holt said. “Lessons drawn from 2003-04 are helpful.”The latest virus has killed at least 25 people so far. It was first detected in Wuhan, China, and cases have since been reported in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and the U.S., with the State Department telling travellers to use increased caution when visiting China.Health Minister Patty Hajdu, speaking to reporters Thursday in Ottawa, said there are no confirmed cases in Canada, though there are a handful of people under observation.“Certainly this isn’t a great time for yet another downside risk to growth,” Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, said by email.Bloomberg.com"

In his speech and a follow-up question and answer session, Soros covered a wide-range of issues, including the “overheated” U.S. economy, the dominance of Facebook Inc. and the autocratic rule of Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, who he called a “con man and the ultimate narcissist.”“Taking into account the climate emergency and worldwide unrest, it’s not an exaggeration to say that 2020 and the next few years will determine not only the fate of Xi and Trump, but also the fate of the world,” he said.Soros also once again criticized Facebook for its failure to police the social media network.“There’s nothing to stop them, and I think there is a kind of informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook,” Soros said. “Facebook will work together to re-elect Trump and Trump will work to protect Facebook.Trump, he said, is responsible for overheating the economy. “An overheated economy can’t be kept boiling for too long,” he said.Soros has hit on these themes in previous Davos speeches. Last year, the philanthropist warned of the “mortal danger” of China’s use of artificial intelligence to repress its citizens under the leadership of Xi, whom he called the most dangerous opponent of democracies.He has also lashed out at social-media giants including Facebook and Google, saying they need to be regulated. Last year he compared them to gambling companies that foster addiction among users and said that they exploit the data they control.Soros has become a lightning rod for his political views and philanthropic efforts. A longtime supporter and financial backer of progressive causes and Democratic politicians, he’s become a target of right-wing activists.Soros closed his hedge fund and converted his firm into a family office.

Carrie Tolstedt, who led Wells Fargo’s community bank for a decade, faces a penalty of as much as US$25 million.“The actions announced by the OCC today reinforce the agency’s expectations that management and employees of national banks and federal savings associations provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly and comply with applicable laws and regulations,” Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said in a statement.Wells Fargo tapped into public and political ire in 2016 with the revelation that bank employees opened millions of potentially fake accounts to meet sales goals. That and a slew of retail-banking issues that subsequently came to light have led to regulatory fallout that’s in many cases unprecedented for a major bank, including a growth cap from the Federal Reserve.This is the first public step the OCC has taken against former executives related to Wells Fargo’s problems. Regulators received criticism from some corners over the fact that few individuals and no top executives were held accountable for crisis-era missteps that cost the banks billions in fines and penalties.Regulatory actions against Wells Fargo have also included billions of dollars in fines and legal costs, and an order giving the OCC the right to remove some of the bank’s leaders. The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission also have been investigating the lender’s issues.The OCC and the Fed have both cited a wide-ranging pattern of abuses and lapses at Wells Fargo.

He may now be selling it at a loss, he said.“It’s definitely compressing the margin,” he said.Burger King’s plant-based Whopper “continues to exceed expectations, drive traffic to our restaurants and attract new incremental guests,” Chris Finazzo, president of the chain’s Americas region, said in a statement. “We continue to see high levels of repeat restaurant visits, showing that guests are enjoying the Impossible Whopper and returning for more over and over again.”It's definitely compressing the marginDominic Flis, Burger King owner  
 
Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc., introduced the meat alternative nationwide last year after a successful test in St. Louis. The company said in October that the sandwich was a “huge hit” and helped U.S. comparable sales, a closely watched measure, climb 5 per cent in the third quarter.Impossible-related promotions have included free delivery, free samples for delayed airport passengers, and beginning last week, the item’s entry on the discount menu.Satisfying SalesImpossible Foods “is satisfied” with sales at fast-food restaurants, spokeswoman Rachel Konrad said. She said that a lot of variability is normal due to factors such as seasonality, ad campaigns and restaurant locations.“We’re happy to work with customers to improve sales across the board,” Konrad said.Across the U.S., restaurants and grocery stores are rushing to add plant-based options. It remains to be seen whether their popularity is a long-lasting trend, but the biggest restaurant and food companies are moving to capitalize on the growth. Starbucks Corp. on Tuesday said it’s exploring meat alternatives for its breakfast menu, while McDonald’s Corp. is testing faux-meat from Beyond Meat in Canada and from Swiss company Nestle SA in Germany. Food distributor Sysco Corp. last week said it’s introducing a new plant-based burger patty in the U.S.More MeatDespite the rising popularity of faux meat, Americans are also eating more real meat than ever. Total red meat and poultry consumption is expected to rise to 225.6 pounds per person this year from 224.3 pounds in 2019, according to USDA data. Even at Burger King, there’s no evidence that the meat-free option has led to less meat consumption.Impossible Whopper sales were not cutting into regular Whopper sales, according to a note from UBS analyst Steven Strycula in December.It’s not surprising that sales have levelled off, said Adam Chandler, author of Drive-Thru Dreams: A Journey Through the Heart of America’s Fast-Food Kingdom.“The fatigue tends to set in after the initial buzz,” he said, noting that Carrols has reported a similar stabilization of Popeyes much-hyped chicken sandwiches. But Chandler doesn’t expect the Impossible Whopper to be cut from menus anytime soon because of the chain’s big investment in a national rollout, he said.“It’s going to stick around for a long time,” he predicted.Bloomberg.com"

That’s the view of Randall Malcolm, Toronto-based senior managing director of fixed income at SLC Management, which oversees $227 billion (US$173.8 billion).“We like to have liquidity in the 20-year part of the curve as we have liability-matching needs across all terms,” Malcolm said in an interview. “It makes sense for them to issue for a few reasons. The current low rates and flat curve are the first incentive.”

Brookfield markets new green bond in Canada, sets sights on Brazil and India
The U.S. said last week it’s reviving sales of 20-year bonds, a type of security the Treasury abandoned in 1986 in favour of 30-year debt. Canada currently sells 10- and 30-year bonds — the last time Canada’s Department of Finance issued 20-year bonds was in 1990, according to government data.A 20-year Canadian bond would yield around 1.65 per cent, according to Bloomberg Valuation estimates. That’s ten basis points less than the central bank’s benchmark rate. By comparison, U.S. Treasuries maturing in 20 years would yield 2.10 per cent, or 55 basis points above the Fed effective rate.Exploring new maturities could make sense at a time when Canada anticipates greater-than-expected deficits. Finance Minister Bill Morneau released estimates last month that showed a budget shortfall for the five-year period between 2019 and 2023 exceeding prior forecasts by about $35 billion.“Locking in lower rates for longer terms gives Canadians greater confidence that a return to higher rates will not impact our standard of life as much,” said Malcolm. “Also, if the government is going to fund long-term infrastructure projects to spur growth, it makes sense to match the term of the funding with the life of the asset.”However, not everyone says Canada should introduce a new maturity. Instead, the country should increase the frequency of its 10- and 30-year bond offerings, Mark Chandler, head of fixed-income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview.A press officer at the Department of Finance in Ottawa said Canada doesn’t have plans to issue a 20-year bond at the moment. The government typically releases its annual budget by the end of March.Bloomberg.com"

At that price, Tesla’s market capitalization was roughly US$107.2 billion, exceeding Volkswagen’s US$99.4 billion and trailing only Toyota Motor Corp.While Musk’s skeptics are dubious that Tesla should be worth more than a carmaker that sold almost 30 times as many vehicles last year, Volkswagen’s own Herbert Diess isn’t so dismissive. He’s been arguably the most vocal CEO among traditional carmakers to praise Tesla and point to its role in a radical shakeup of the more than century-old auto industry.

After saying three months ago that Tesla was no niche manufacturer anymore, Diess told top Volkswagen executives at an internal meeting in Germany last week that connected vehicles will almost double the time consumers spend online, and that cars will “become the most important mobile device.”“If we see that, then we also understand why Tesla is so valuable from the view of analysts,” he said.Diess, 61, is rolling out the industry’s largest electric-car fleet and aims to boost the company’s value to a level rivalling Toyota, whose US$232 billion market cap is still more than Tesla and VW’s combined.“Tesla has high innovative strength regarding battery-electric vehicles as well as connectivity, which can partly explain the high market capitalization,” Stefan Bratzel, a researcher at the Center of Automotive Management near Cologne, Germany, said in a report Wednesday. The relatively low valuation of traditional automakers is linked to uncertainty over whether they can navigate the looming industry shift, he said.

The jump above US$100 billion is about more than just bragging rights for Musk, Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer. He’s eligible to receive the first tranche of an all-or-nothing pay award if the company’s market value stays above that threshold for a sustained period. On paper, the first chunk of the award would net him about US$346 million.Tesla shares have more than doubled since the company reported a surprise third-quarter profit and told investors it was ahead of schedule bringing out its next product, the Model Y crossover, and opening its factory near Shanghai.The stock has room to run as Tesla grows in China, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a report Wednesday. He boosted his target price to US$550 from US$370 while maintaining the equivalent of a hold rating.Gary Black, who was chief executive of Aegon Asset Management from mid 2016 through September and now holds Tesla as a private investor, said he expects Tesla to earn more than VW by 2025 and believes consensus estimates for vehicle deliveries this year are too low. He expects Musk to forecast at least 550,000 units for 2020 during next week’s earnings webcast and to tout the launch of the Model Y.While at least eight analysts have boosted their price targets by more than US$100 since the year began, consensus is still well below where Tesla’s shares are trading. The average target is US$363.92 with just 10 analysts rating the stock a buy, compared with 10 holds and 16 sells.Bloomberg.com"

The precious metal has roared out of the blocks in 2020, building on a 54 per cent surge in 2019, as demand eclipses production for the material used in devices that cleanse vehicle emissions. The upswing to a series of all-time highs has investors asking whether the rally will endure. Currie’s comments suggest both greater upside, and a very volatile ride.“This process is likely to continue until auto producers finally switch to other precious metals, like platinum and rhodium,” he said in an email after an interview with Bloomberg TV in Hong Kong. “But this will likely only happen when the palladium shortages become severe enough to create problems in producing a car, which is still a ways away.”Spot palladium set its latest record Monday, hitting US$2,577.27 an ounce. It fell 3.5 per cent to $2,456.18 on Tuesday, but that’s still 80 per cent higher than 12 months ago.

Last month, Deputy Governor Timothy Lane defended the Bank of Canada’s decision to buck the global easing trend, saying the nation’s resilient economy is allowing it to “chart its own course in monetary policy.”“The more that we hear from Bank of Canada the less they seem willing” to cut rates, said Frances Donald, Toronto-based global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management.InflationUnderlying price pressure as measured by core inflation has been stable near the Bank of Canada’s 2 per cent target for about two years. That reflects an economy running nicely at around its capacity — neither too hot nor too cold.

Remember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade
Oil remains a pillar of Canada's economy, but it's the digital economy that's driving growth
Of course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it’s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than 1 per cent for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists.But the net effect of the changes isn’t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada means the economy probably had less slack to begin with.A weak fourth quarter also doesn’t necessarily mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front.Home PricesOfficials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern.Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That’s one more reason not to cut.Core MandateTo be sure, Poloz won’t hesitate to lower rates if there’s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank’s primary inflation-targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern.So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While investors are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June.Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz’s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008. So did Gordon Thiessen in 2001.That said, as long as the economy remains in a relatively good place and household debt levels continue to pick up, Poloz may be content to simply stand pat before he stands down.Bloomberg.com"

Representatives for Alstom and Bombardier declined to comment.Bombardier rose as much as 4.9 per cent in trading in Toronto Tuesday. The shares were up 4.1 per cent at 3:11 p.m., giving the company a value of $3.13 billion (US$2.39 billion).

The latest considerations between Bombardier and Alstom could face antitrust scrutiny, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. A rail deal is among several options the Canadian company is exploring to stabilize its portfolio, which also includes business jets, they said.The deliberations started before Bombardier shocked the market last week by warning of disappointing fourth-quarter sales, according to the people. Bombardier also said at the time that it may exit a joint venture with Airbus SE that makes the A220 jetliner and potentially take a major writedown. Bombardier shares dropped as much as 39 per cent on the news, a record decline.China CompetitionA takeover of Bombardier’s rail business by Alstom would mark the latest attempt by some of the world’s biggest trainmakers to counter growing competition from China. Bombardier in 2017 held talks to combine its rail operations with competitor Siemens AG until the German company suddenly opted to pursue a deal with Alstom.The European Union then in February 2019 blocked the Franco-German merger, which would have created a European rail champion, after regulators refused to cave in to warnings about the looming threat of Chinese competition.While historically best known as a manufacturer of metro, commuter and regional trains, Bombardier has collaborated in high-speed projects including Alstom’s high-speed TGV.US$6 Billion InvestmentThe potential end of Bombardier’s involvement in A220 manufacturing, combined with new stumbles in the company’s rail business, have undermined a once-great name in manufacturing — just when investors thought they were poised to reap the rewards of a difficult turnaround effort. Walking away from the A220 would close the book on Bombardier’s work on an aircraft program in which the company invested more than US$6 billion.The negative earnings announcement could hamper efforts to reach a deal with Alstom, weighing on the estimated value of the Canadian company’s rail operations or spurring both firms to focus on their own separate businesses, the people said.Bombardier in 2015 sold a 30 per cent stake in its Berlin-based train business to pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, valuing the unit at US$5 billion at the time and helping the firm raise capital as it faced a cash drain from delays for its new jets.

Overall, dairy products are the biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions across the coffee giant’s operations and supply chain.Those are just two findings from Starbucks’s most sweeping environmental assessment, unveiled Tuesday as the company announced ambitious goals for reducing its impact. By 2030, the cafe chain is targeting 50 per cent reductions in carbon emissions, water withdrawal and waste sent to landfills.The task is immense: Starbucks in 2018 was responsible for emitting 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, using 1 billion cubic meters of water and dumping 868 metric kilotons — more than twice the weight of the Empire State Building — of coffee cups and other waste. The audit was conducted with sustainability consultant Quantis and the World Wildlife Fund.

“We know this journey will be challenging, we know we can’t do this alone, and we know this will require others to join us,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in an interview.Starbucks shares fell as much as 1.1 per cent to US$92.62 on Tuesday in New York trading. The stock has advanced about 6 per cent so far in 2020, double the advance of the S&P 500 Index.The company, which has more than 31,000 outlets in more than 80 markets, joins a parade of companies announcing green initiatives as the World Economic Forum in Davos gets underway with a redoubled focus on climate change. This year’s gathering in the Swiss ski resort features Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, while Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink of BlackRock Inc. set the tone by warning that the asset manager will address the issue in its investments.We know this journey will be challenging, we know we can’t do this alone, and we know this will require others to join usCEO Kevin Johnson 
 
The coffee chain’s moves follow investor pressure, with a resolution calling on the company to step up the use of sustainable packaging receiving support from almost half of shareholders at its annual general meeting last year.“While Starbucks has a long road ahead to achieve these goals, we’re encouraged that its priorities are rooted in transparent data and will be supplemented by first-of-its-kind market research,” said Allan Pearce, shareholder advocate at Trillium Asset Management.Under founder and former CEO Howard Schultz, Starbucks focused on sustainability by purchasing renewable energy, investing in climate-resistant coffee trees and giving discounts to customers who brought their own tumblers. Johnson, who took the helm in 2017, sold US$1 billion of bonds to help fund the green and ethical sourcing initiatives. The company has named its first chief sustainability officer, Michael Kobori, who is joining from Levi Strauss & Co.‘Resource Positive’At an unspecified point beyond 2030, Johnson said, the company aims to become “resource positive” by storing more carbon than it emits, eliminating waste and providing more fresh water than it uses.The moves come as governments around the world step up action on the environment with measures such as a pending European Union ban on some single-use plastics.Other chains are acting too. McDonald’s Corp. has said it aims to cut restaurant and office emissions by 36 per cent from 2015 levels through 2030. KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands Inc. is seeking a 10% average reduction per store by the end of 2025.Alternative milks will be a big part of the solutionCEO Kevin Johnson 
 
The fast-food chains start from a higher base. Each outlet was responsible for more than four times the level of carbon dioxide emissions as Starbucks stores in 2017, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Cooking and selling a broader range of menu items, including carbon-intensive meat, makes cutting emissions tougher.Starbucks has switched to wind power in some of its cafes, but meeting its carbon-reduction goals will require bigger changes. Johnson said he’ll push consumers to choose milk made from almond, coconuts, soy or oats, whose production is environmentally friendlier than dairy. In North America, 15 per cent to 20 per cent of Starbucks customers already choose such options.Alternative Milk“Alternative milks will be a big part of the solution,” Johnson said. “The consumer-demand curve is already shifting.”The Seattle-based company is testing new drinks made with plant-based ingredients and seeking ways to make whipped cream without emitting nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas. Starbucks also aims to lower the cost of dairy alternatives by helping suppliers boost output, he said.Tackling another form of pollution — the food and drink containers that litter city streets, clog landfills and often end up in the world’s oceans — has been equally challenging. Starbucks says it’s responsible for about 1 per cent of the estimated 600 billion disposable cups used globally every year.

Around March of this year, the company plans to begin testing a paper cup it’s been developing with partners seeking a more widely recyclable and compostable hot-drink container. Existing ones generally contain a plastic layer that makes them difficult to process. Costa Coffee, a U.K.-based chain owned by Coca-Cola Co., two years ago announced plans to pay waste collectors a supplement to handle them, boosting its recycling efforts.Starbucks previously reined back a goal set in 2008, which was to serve 25 per cent of coffee in personal travel mugs. Only about 5 per cent of U.K. customers use reusable containers even though the company offers a 25-pence (33-cent) discount for them, while charging a 5-pence fee for paper cups.Lost SalesA smaller U.K. chain, Boston Tea Party Cafes, has eliminated single-use cups entirely, but that cost it 25 per cent of takeaway coffee sales in the first year after the initiative went into effect.Johnson said he’s counting on Generation Z to lead adoption of environmentally friendlier practices, saying this will make it financially rewarding for companies to respond. Starbucks will stick to its long-term target of double-digit growth in earnings per share despite the cost of its green goals, he said.“It won’t be a linear journey,” Johnson said. “We’ll have positive steps and then we’ll try something else that works. There’s no silver bullet.”Bloomberg.com"

He also said: “This is not a time for pessimism, this is a time for optimism.

The forum is sounding alarm bells on climate change. This year and for the first time on record, environmental risks occupy the group’s top five long-term concerns, while corporate executives say they’re increasingly concerned about environmental issues.Trump’s remarks were largely focused on America’s economy as an example to other nations, which he urged to cut regulations and taxes. Trump sought to take credit for a booming economy, repeating his re-election arguments just hours before the U.S. Senate was set to formally start his impeachment trial.

“I’m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before,” Trump said. “We’ve regained our stride, rediscovered our spirit.”Trump recounted how his administration presided over cuts in regulations and taxes, and described low unemployment rates for African Americans and women.Claiming CreditTrump claims credit for overseeing an economy enjoying its longest-ever expansion, with an unemployment rate that fell to a five-decade low after tax cuts and spending increases. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which Trump regularly cites as a marker of success, is up about 25 per cent from a year ago.But his fight with China over trade and other protectionist policies have created uncertainty among businesses, especially manufacturers. Despite last week’s interim trade deal with Beijing, the International Monetary Fund on Monday predicted economic growth will moderate to 2 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 2021 from 2.3 per cent in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes.America’s thriving, America is flourishing and, yes, America is winning again like never beforeDonald Trump 
 
In his speech at the Swiss resort, Trump said: “The American dream is back, bigger better and stronger than ever before.”The president repeated his grievances with the Fed, saying it raised rates too quickly and lowered them too slowly.Trump said in his speech that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping “love each other” even after their fight over trade.“He’s for China and I’m for the U.S., but other than that, we love each other,” Trump said.Meeting LeadersTrump is due to hold bilateral meetings with Iraqi President Barham Salih, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga and Nechirvan Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, according to the White House. Trump will also meet with the forum’s executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, and has said he’ll meet with business leaders, too. He leaves Davos on Wednesday.This is Trump’s second visit as president to the annual gathering of business chiefs, central bankers and foreign leaders. Hanging over the trip this time, however, is his impeachment trial set to formally begin in the Senate. Trump will almost certainly be acquitted by the Republican majority in the Senate, but the trial may produce surprises.Trump has sought to highlight his trade and economic victories to contrast the impeachment proceedings. He skipped Davos in 2017 out of concern that the well-heeled Davos crowd was the wrong fit for a man elected on a nationalist, anti-elites message. He attended in 2018, then skipped last year amid a government shutdown.Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the biggest-name political leaders in attendance; Trump has regularly complained that Merkel spends too little on defence, doesn’t do enough in Ukraine and is too soft on Iran’s regime, but won’t meet with her in Davos.Other speakers include teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Trump has insulted on Twitter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose phone call with Trump triggered the impeachment process, is also due to attend briefly but not to meet with the U.S. president.Once Trump leaves on Wednesday, the U.S. delegation will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Trump’s first Davos appearance in 2018 oscillated between a vintage, raucous version of Trump in meetings with national leaders and business executives and more subdued remarks in his formal speech. He touted his agenda but added: “America First does not mean America alone.”Bloomberg.com"

David Rosenberg: The Fed seems to think we are in a happy economic place — but we aren’t
Rosenberg started his own independent research firm in January — Rosenberg Research and Associates Inc. — after more than a decade as chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. His warning of a U.S. housing bubble in 2005 when he was at Merrill Lynch proved prescient but he stayed bearish long after the economy had revived. He was bullish for five years starting in 2012 but has turned negative in recent years.This is a liquidity-driven market. Liquidity is your best friend on Monday and your worst coward on FridayDavid Rosenberg 
 
The roaring stock market is essentially a “bull market in financial engineering,” stoked by the Fed Reserve’s purchases of Treasury bills starting in October, interest rate cuts, U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul (which handed America’s top banks a US$32 billion windfall) and corporate share buybacks.“Last year, was like, just throw a dart,” he said. “Right now, it’s indiscriminate buying. Investing isn’t supposed to be like that. Investing isn’t supposed to be easy.”The Debate Over Whether to Call It QE Is Over, and the Fed LostWhile economists only see a 30 per cent chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, Rosenberg said a retreat in spending on restaurants, movies and furnishings and other discretionary spending are harbingers of a slowdown, along with a deceleration in U.S. core inflation.“When you stop hearing ‘where are we going for dinner tonight?’ and instead you start hearing ‘who’s cooking dinner?’ then you know that a new form of frugality is taking place.”Here’s how he’s battening down the hatches in his model portfolio:Gold“Gold is a place you want to be. I think that it’s partly because its inversely correlated with interest rates. But it’s also an insurance policy when things go wrong,” he said. “There’s no such thing as a no-brainer, but this is close.”Bullion is off to a roaring start this year as strategists from Goldman Sachs to UBS Group AG called for $1,600 an ounce even before the Iranian crisis impacted global markets. The yellow metal has gained about a third since August 2018 and was trading around $1560 per ounce Monday.JapanJapan’s stock market is one that’s a “blind hold” for Rosenberg. Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor. The country has also pushed companies to distribute dividends, introduce and/or expand share buybacks and have allowed for foreigners on corporate boards as shareholder activism picks up. “This is revolutionary in Japan.”Bonds in DragBond-proxies in the stock market, or what Rosenberg calls “bonds in drag” are also good investments as the economy heads into a downturn. Utilities, REITs and pipelines, which he calls asset-backed cash flow generators, are worth holding.“It’s really more about putting together a portfolio of stocks — non-cyclical, liquid, strong balance sheets, with not much of a refinancing calendar that have been able to increase their dividends,” he said.“Downright cheap” energy stocks are also favoured by Rosenberg. “Energy stocks are not priced for WTI where we are right now. They are priced for something that’s gotta be at least 20 per cent – 30 per cent lower.”Defence stocks are a cheaper way to boost exposure to tech as countries beef up military spending. “Defence is actually a technology. You can buy it at a lower multiple. Everybody is spending more money on military. The one thing that Trump has done, he’s done a lot of stuff, he has successfully pressured the NATO allies to spend more on military.”End GameThe Fed’s asset purchases have created “so much liquidity” in global markets that it should be concerned, Rosenberg said. “There’ll be some other solution than just the Fed expanding its balance sheet in perpetuity,” he said. “Because that’s what’s creating this bubble.”The U.S. and Canadian economies will slow and central banks will cut interest rates. Eventually, the Fed will have to print money and the Treasury will have to distribute it to the public to stimulate growth — the so-called “helicopter drop” of money.“There’s going to be an end game and it is the magical money tree,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

But the rapid dash to alternative assets by the stewards of retirement cash comes with risks, and it’s caught the attention of regulators. One major worry is that a downturn in funds would struggle to pull cash out of illiquid assets. While pension funds typically hold debt until maturity it doesn’t mean they can’t be hurt by mark-to-market losses.The head of CPPIB said that while there’s little to worry about in the near-term, investors should be very careful about the huge shift of assets from public to private markets which could trigger steeper selloffs and exacerbate a crisis.Trade Tensions“You have to be very careful to make sure that you truly understand the liquidity positions, that you truly understand if that thing turns out to not be liquid you can still cope, and if you can still pay the university, the pensioners,” he said.The Toronto-based pension fund manages $409.5 billion (US$313 billion) in assets for about 20 million Canadian pensioners. Half of that is in illiquid assets, Machin said. CPPIB reported a 2.3 per cent return on investments for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Its ten and five-year annualized net nominal returns were 10.2 per cent and 10.3 per cent respectively.I do worry about the expansion of a lot of funds like us around the world into private illiquid assetsMark Machin 
 
“Our view is that these global trade tensions will continue and create some weight on global trading and supply chains and technology. There is nowhere to hide from that so you need to diversify,” he said. “If you sell, you have to hold something. For us, you’d have to invest in something else either its cash or some physical commodities.”CPPIB, which currently holds about 85 per cent of its assets outside of Canada, plans to boost exposure to better-yielding emerging markets, lifting that allocation to one-third of its portfolio in the next five years. The pension fund still sees private equity as a good asset class from a risk return point of view and is relying on venture capital to participate early in the next market trends.Bloomberg.com"

Both figures are down compared with forecasts in October, and it marks the IMF’s sixth straight reduction for 2019.The report, however, contains a sense of modest hope, noting that risks are “less skewed” toward negative outcomes. That outlook will be keenly discussed this week at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The sense that global growth is stabilizing is shared by many economists, as well as some central banks.

U.S., China trade deal bodes ill for Canada’s farmers
For the IMF, which sees growth accelerating to 3.4 per cent in 2021, the positives include signs that the slump in manufacturing and global trade is bottoming out, “intermittent” good news on U.S.-China trade talks and accommodative monetary policy.The Fund even quantified the impact of central bank’s efforts to shore up growth last year. It said growth in 2019 and 2020 would be 0.5 percentage point weaker without their stimulus push.“Globally the big story is this extraordinary pivot by central banks in 2019,” BlackRock Vice Chairman Philip Hildebrand said on Bloomberg Television. “What’s been holding this back or offsetting this is the trade risks, the geopolitical risks, so if we can pull back on those, we should see global growth edging up.”The IMF made modest downgrades to 2020 projections for the U.S. and the euro area, while India’s forecast was slashed by more than a percentage point. The prediction for global trade volume growth was cut to 2.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent, though that would still be far better than last year’s 1 per cent.While risks have eased, the IMF was clear that that there’s still plenty to worry about. Progress in trade talks is stop-start, simmering U.S.-Iran tensions could hit oil supply, and there’s also social unrest and weather-related disasters.“Few signs of turning points are yet visible in global macroeconomic data,” it said. “The risk of protracted subpar global growth remains tangible despite tentative signs of stabilizing momentum.”The U.S.-China trade pact, signed Jan. 15, reduces the cumulative negative effect of the battle on output over 2019 and 2020 to 0.5 per cent, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said. The previous estimate was 0.8 per cent, or $700 billion, with tariffs accounting for a third and the rest from companies not investing, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in Washington Friday.“A trade truce is not the same as trade peace,” Georgieva said. Completion of the first phase of the deal mean a “shrinkage of the negative impact, but not an eradication.”Other ForecastsThe fund held or reduced its estimates for most of the world’s biggest economies for 2020, with Japan a notable exception. It raised the outlook to 0.7 per cent from 0.5 per cent, reflecting the anticipated boost from stimulus measures undertaken in December. The fund raised China’s estimate by 0.2 percentage point to 6 per cent. The phase one trade deal is likely to alleviate near-term cyclical weakness, though unresolved disputes on broader U.S.-China economic relations “will continue weighing on activity.” The 2020 estimate for the U.S. was lowered by 0.1 percentage point to 2 per cent, and 2021 held at 1.7 per cent. India’s downgrade was because domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in the non-bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth, the fund said. Bloomberg.com"

Beware the pitfalls and perils of the gig economy
Here are the hot talking points:Peak Globalization?The era of people, goods and money flowing increasingly unchecked around the world may have past its high point as governments pursue protectionism and erect more obstacles to migration. Already there are around 77 physical barriers delineating international borders compared with 15 in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, according to Bank of America. The World Trade Organization calculates the pace of growth in international commerce fell below the rate of economic expansion in 2019 for the fifth time since the financial crisis. Foreign direct investment inflows have been on the decline since 2015, says the United Nations.The U.S.-China trade war is at the center of the shift. But even with the signing of an interim deal, the Peterson Institute for International Economics reckons the average U.S. tariff on imports from China is still 19.3 per cent versus 3.1 per cent at the start of 2018. Away from Beijing, Trump is also seeking to remodel the World Trade Organization and potentially clamp down on European auto exports. The U.K. still needs to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.Still, the continued development of the digital economy, rising tourism and mounting reliance of companies on revenues generated outside their home market provide room for confidence globalization is evolving rather than ending.Peak Capitalism?JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc. Founder Laurence Fink, both of whom will be in Davos, are among those who have entered the debate over whether companies should better weigh stakeholders such as customers and employees, a departure from the decades-old shareholder-first mindset.Behind the shift: the rise of populism, concern wages aren’t keeping up with assets such as equities and fears over climate change.The maturing millennial generation are a driving force too. When making investment decisions, 87 per cent of those born between 1981 and 1996 believe environmental, social and governance factors are important, according to Bank of America.Peak Inequality?The pressure to reduce inequality will become more urgent this decade as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals approach their 2030 deadline. 193 governments have signed up to 17 goals, 169 targets and 304 indicators on how to end poverty, clean up the environment and share prosperity for all.There has already been some progress. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, last year’s winners of the Nobel Prize for economics, estimate the average income of the world’s bottom 50 per cent of earners also almost doubled since 1980.But William Gale of the Brookings Institution notes the 400 richest Americans owned 3.26 per cent of wealth in 2018, up from 0.93 per cent in 1982. The top 1 per cent also paid about a third of their income in tax in both 1979 and 2019, he says. Expect such numbers to be bandied about ahead of the U.S. election in November, with some Democrat candidates promoting higher corporate and wealth taxes.Peak Youth?For the first time, there are now more seniors than children in the world and that trend is set to escalate, according to the UN. The global fertility rate already halved from 5 children per woman in 1955 and the average life expectancy has increased from 31 in 1900 to 72 today and is tipped to reach 83 by the end of this century.While another 1 billion people are expected on the planet by 2030, the demographic mix will be starkly different. For starters, the number of those aged 65 or older will outnumber children under the age of 5.The growth of the working age population is also set to slow, straining pensions and healthcare resources. In a recent paper, Stanford University Professor Charles Jones said there is a “distinct possibility” that global population will decline rather than stabilize in the long run, threatening economic growth.Peak Climate Change?The world faces a sweeping series of climate-related tipping points — from melting ice caps to droughts and dying coral reefs. Nature magazine in November collated the risks, which they described as a climate emergency that will compel political and economic actions on emissions. 21 of the hottest years on record came in the last quarter century.“We argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best,” the article’s authors wrote.The international effort to rein in fossil fuel pollution took a knock in December after marathon UN talks watered down language on issues they had agreed on in previous years.Peak oil demand?Hotter temperatures have put new scrutiny on the world’s energy mix.This means renewable energy like solar and wind, plus electric vehicles are going to soar up the policy agenda at the cost of fossil fuel gurgling vehicles. Big Oil executives believe that peak oil demand is increasingly likely in the late 2030s.For example, Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer and the most profitable company in the planet, said on its initial public offering prospectus that oil demand may peak around 2035, with demand “leveling off.”Peak Cars?The 1.3 billion vehicles on the roads today are probably the most there will ever be. Megacities will house around two thirds of the global population by mid-century, cutting back on the need for expensive cars.Evolving urban architecture will also increasingly constrain car usage. The shift is already underway in mature markets. Only 26 per cent of U.S. 16-year-olds earned a driver’s licence in 2017 compared with almost half just 36 years ago, according to Sivak Applied Research. Even if overall car sales remain robust, cheaper technology such as robotaxis and developments such as ride-sharing stand to take the shine off their attractiveness.Peak Central Banks?Central banks may have rescued the world from depression in the wake of the financial crisis, but their ability to turnaround their economies from here is limited after what Bank of America estimates is more than 700 interest rate cuts and around US$12 trillion in quantitative easing since 2009.Negative interest rates are already being blamed for hurting banks, while demographic shifts, record debt levels, technological disruption and bank deleveraging all sap the potency of monetary policy. That leaves politicians under pressure to loosen fiscal policy the next time trouble hits the world economy.Bloomberg.com"

The companies describe Facebook as “one of the largest unlawful monopolies ever seen in the United States” and say the aim of the lawsuit is “to halt the most brazen, willful anticompetitive scheme in a generation.”The big internet platforms are facing a high level of scrutiny of their business practices after years of virtual inaction in Washington.

Gap shares rose 6.9 per cent at 7.22 a.m. on Friday. The company said it expects full 2019 profit to be “moderately above” its previous projection of US$1.70 to US$1.75 a share because of “better than anticipated promotional levels over the holiday period.”The company also announced that Neil Fiske, president and chief executive officer of Gap brand, will leave the company. Gap has struggled in recent years to find its identity, with several fashion misses and declining sales.“Gap has lost its identity,” said Poonam Goyal, a retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It needs to fix operational execution, brand messaging and the entire organization needs an uplift. Who is Gap and who are they trying to attract?”The decision is a significant shift for Gap. A day after Peck’s departure last November, the company said its board “continues to believe in the strategic rationale for the planned separation, and the preparation for separation continues as planned.”However, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik had questioned the spinoff in a note this month, asking whether it “continues to make strategic sense” considering its “recently underwhelming results.”The cost of the separation may have been an issue. In a September presentation about the spinoff, Gap said the separation would create a one-time expense of US$400 million to US$450 million, and cost US$300 million to US$350 million in terms of capital.Khaki JuggernautGap, founded in 1969 in San Francisco, rose to prominence as a denim emporium selling jeans from Levi Strauss & Co., another Bay Area institution.

Four reasons to be upbeat about markets you won’t find in the headlines
So-called liquid alts — which encompass everything from hedge funds to real estate, private debt and equity and infrastructure — are taking off as investors chase higher yields outside those offered by traditional bonds. Investments have reached about US$882 billion, including about $47 billion in exchange traded funds, according to Greenwich Associates.A year ago, regulators cleared the way for the mutual funds in Canada. A total of 37 funds from 15 companies had been launched by July, with assets reaching $3.4 billion, according to a report by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.Rubbish FundsUnlike typical hedge funds, investors can take money out on a daily basis. They’re often more transparent and cheaper than the 20 per cent performance fee that hedge funds typically carry.Algonquin’s fund has no performance fee. The first $50 million in investments will pay a 50-basis point management fee and after that the fund will charge 95 basis points.“Other funds are doing a light version of a hedge fund and we’re really building a much enhanced version of a normal bond fund,” D’Costa said. “We really want it to replace all the rubbish bond funds that are out there where people have added all kinds of other risks to to enhance yields.”Algonquin will focus on purchasing North American investment-grade corporate bonds while shorting government notes to leverage lower risk positions. Leverage will typically be about 2.25 times.5 per cent YieldThe goal is to get a 5 per cent yield, without an enormous amount of high-yield debt and staying away from emerging markets, commodities and currency risks. Bond maturities will typically be four years, which brings the interest-rate risk down, portfolio manager Alex Schwiersch said.“A traditional bond fund is going to return 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent a year if you’re lucky over the cycle. And you’re going to have to take a lot of risks, a lot of duration, to do that,” Schwiersch said. “We can offer a product that, even though it’s a liquid alternative, it’s going to behave more like a bond fund.”Up to 6 per cent of Algonquin’s new fund, which launched this week, could be held in a single asset. It expects to invest in a broad range of sectors including financials, communications, consumer products, energy, health care, industrials, infrastructure, real estate, technology and provincial bonds in Canada and the U.S. Typically around 25 per cent of the fund may be invested in non-investment grade credits.Bloomberg.com"

Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has joined Carlos Ghosn in the 1 per cent legal club.Those are the odds that the Chinese executive will win her bid to avoid extradition to the U.S., similar to the chances of acquittal for the auto titan-turned-fugitive in Japan. While Ghosn fled Japan in a big black box for Lebanon, Meng squares up to begin extradition hearings in a Vancouver court on Monday, 13 months after she was arrested on a U.S. handover request.The hearings offer her first shot — however slim — at release as a Canadian judge considers whether the case meets the crucial test of double criminality: would her alleged crime have also been a crime in Canada? If not, she could be discharged, according to Canada’s extradition rules.

“There’d be nothing holding her — bail restrictions, house arrest, all of that would be eliminated,” said Michael Klein, a Vancouver lawyer who worked alongside Meng’s lawyers in a 2004 extradition case. “Just like if you’re acquitted in a criminal case, the Crown may appeal, but that person’s a free person.”Meng, the eldest daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has become the highest profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company, which Washington sees as a national security threat. The U.S. accuses her of fraud, saying she lied to HSBC Holdings Plc to trick it into conducting transactions in breach of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng, who turns 48 next month, is charged with bank and wire fraud, which carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison on conviction.

“In most extradition cases, double criminality is an easy piece of analysis,” says Brock Martland, a Vancouver-based criminal lawyer.In Meng’s case, it’s not, which may help nudge her into the 1 per cent of defendants in Canada who have historically beaten extradition orders to the U.S.Her defence has argued that the U.S. case is, in reality, a sanctions-violations complaint that it’s sought to “dress up” as fraud to make it easier to extradite her. Had Meng’s alleged conduct taken place in Canada, the transactions by HSBC wouldn’t have violated any Canadian sanctions, they say. Canada’s federal prosecutors counter the underlying offence is fraud because she lied to HSBC, causing them to miscalculate Huawei’s risk as a creditor and conduct transactions it otherwise wouldn’t have.Hong Kong TeahouseAnother potential sticking point is that Meng’s alleged misconduct didn’t take place in the U.S. or Canada — it rests heavily on a 2013 meeting at a Hong Kong teahouse between Meng and an HSBC banker.“Canadian fraud laws do not have an extraterritorial reach,” said Ravi Hira, a Vancouver-based lawyer and former special prosecutor. “If you commit a fraud in Hong Kong, I can’t just prosecute you in Canada.”While the double-criminality hearings are scheduled for four days, the ruling would likely come much later — possibly in months.Being trapped in the middle of a trade war has brought the luxury of time. Before her arrest, Meng travelled so frequently for the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker that she’d gone through at least seven passports in a decade. These days, she passes her time oil painting and pursuing an online doctorate. Phone calls with her father have gone from once a year to every few days.“If a busy life has eaten away at my time, then hardship has in turn drawn it back out,” Meng wrote in a poignant letter to her supporters last month on the one-year anniversary of her arrest. “It was never my intention to be stuck here so long.”Ghosn EscapeMeng would find it harder to pull a Ghosn. She’s under 24-hour surveillance by at least two guards at her $13 million (US$10 million) mansion. Her whereabouts are recorded continuously by a GPS tracker on her left ankle. While she’s allowed to roam a roughly 100-square-mile patch of Vancouver during the day accompanied by security, any violation — including tampering with the device or venturing anywhere near the airport — would automatically alert police. She’s posted bail of $10 million, of which $3 million came from a group of guarantors, some of whom pledged their homes as collateral. Fleeing would cost them all.If the court finds her case fails the double-criminality test, Canada’s attorney general would have the right to appeal within 30 days. In theory, she could be on a plane back to China well before that, says Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who’s been involved in hundreds of Canadian extradition cases.

Of the 798 U.S. extradition requests received since 2008, Canada has only refused or discharged eight, according to the department of justice. That’s a 99 per cent chance of being handed over — similar to the conviction rate in Japan. Another 40 cases were withdrawn by the U.S.Still, that’s fractionally better than the odds of two Canadians detained in China, where the conviction rate currently stands at 99.9 per cent, according to Amnesty International.Canadians JailedThat’s if Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor ever make it to trial. The two men were thrown in jail on spying allegations just days after Meng’s arrest in December 2018. Last month, the Chinese government confirmed their cases were transferred to prosecutors, raising the possibility they might finally get access to lawyers.As of last week, that hadn’t happened yet for Kovrig, according to the International Crisis Group, his employer. The former diplomat has been allowed one consular visit a month; in between, he’s unreachable. Communication with his family is limited to letters exchanged in those visits, according to the group.Families of the two men aren’t speaking publicly for fear of jeopardizing their cases. Some sense of the conditions they’re enduring can be gleaned from past history.Spavor, a businessman who ran tours to North Korea from his base in a border town in northeastern China, has been held since May in Dandong Detention Centre, according to the Globe and Mail.It’s a jail familiar to another Canadian, Kevin Garratt, who was snatched along with his wife Julia by Chinese security agents in 2014, becoming pawns in an earlier high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from extraditing millionaire businessman Su Bin to the U.S.Garratt spent 19 months in the forbidding compound surrounded by two-story-high cement walls. Crammed into a cell with up to 14 other inmates, he slurped meals from a communal bowl on the floor. If they were lucky, they got 30 minutes of hot water a day and could exercise in a small outdoor cage, he said in a December 2018 interview.China calls Meng’s arrest politically motivated and accuses Canada of “arbitrary detention.” It rejects any suggestion that the seizures of Kovrig and Spavor were in retaliation, saying China is also a rule-of-law country.Before her arrest, Meng wasn’t happy working at Huawei and had been considering leaving, Ren has said in media interviews. But hardship has toughened her — when released, she will resume her role, he says.“Over the past year, I have also learned to face up to and accept my situation,” Meng said in her letter. “I’m no longer afraid of the rough road ahead.”Bloomberg.com"

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement passed the House in December on a bipartisan 385-41 vote the day after the Democratic-led chamber voted to impeach Trump.The Senate vote is also moving in tandem with the impeachment process, coming just a few hours before Chief Justice John Roberts is sworn in to preside over the trial.

“A major win for our country. A major win for the Trump administration. A major win for those of us who are ready to move past this season of toxic political noise and get back to doing even more of the American people’s business,“ McConnell said on the Senate floor.Political WinDemocrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, finally got behind the trade agreement in December after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration over changes to provisions regarding labor, the environment, pharmaceuticals and the overall enforcement of the deal. The changes won over Democratic senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren who criticized previous free trade deals.Some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, still opposed the deal because it doesn’t explicitly mention climate change.“Despite the fact that it includes very good labour provisions, I am voting against USMCA because it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet,” Schumer said in a statement before the vote.A handful of free-trade conservatives like Pennsylvania GOP Senator Pat Toomey also voted against the agreement for creating new wage requirements in the auto industry, among other market interventions.McConnell initially said the Senate wouldn’t act on the USMCA until it had finished with Trump’s impeachment trial, but Pelosi’s decision to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate created a window for the vote this week. The Senate Finance Committee and six other panels rushed to approve the deal since lawmakers returned from their holiday recess last week.Passing this revision of the North America Free Trade Agreement gives Trump a victory to tout in his election-year State of the Union address scheduled for Feb. 4. While the USMCA is projected to add just 0.35 per cent to GDP after six years, signing this agreement and the first phase of a China trade deal will relieve some economic uncertainty, helping Trump’s pitch to voters based on the strength of the U.S. economy.For Democrats from narrowly divided or Republican-leaning districts, the USMCA allows them to show constituents that they’re working with the president and doing more than impeaching him.

A week later, Catalyst persuaded an investment group to sweeten its offer a second time for Hudson’s Bay Co., likely ending a six-month battle over the Saks Fifth Avenue owner.A closer look shows that while the HBC transaction may yield double-digit gains for Catalyst, the Gateway deal won’t result in any significant windfall for its backers. Some of these investors had already been reluctant to invest fresh cash into the private equity firm, according to people familiar with the matter, including four who were sounded out starting in 2017 on plans for a potential new fund.

Callidus Capital shareholder reaches deal to take company private as debt mounts
Catalyst has owned Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd., one of Canada’s biggest gaming companies with 25 properties, since 2009. After at least two looks at going public, it filed for an initial public offering in November 2018, targeting a total valuation of as much as $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion), a person familiar with the matter said at the time.That’s a far cry from the sale announced this month with Leisure Acquisition Co., known as a special purpose acquisition company. It values the combined entity at $1.46 billion, with debt. Looking at it another way, Catalyst’s 30 per cent equity stake in the new firm is worth about US$132 million, according to the deal metrics released this month. As recently as the third quarter of 2019, Catalyst said its 74 per cent stake was worth more than US$750 million, according to a report sent to investors.A representative for Toronto-based Catalyst said these numbers “are wrong and don’t reflect important aspects of the transaction in terms of the structure, equity, cash, non-participating assets and the value delivered to Catalyst LPs over the last six years through refinancings and other transactions.” The firm is under restrictions to comment given the marketing of the Gateway transaction.Sweeter BidOn the proposed Hudson’s Bay deal, Glassman scored a major win for minority shareholders by prompting a higher bid from a group led by Chairman Richard Baker. Catalyst accumulated shares over the summer, amassing a 17.5 per cent stake to fight for a better price, while appealing to the Ontario Securities Commission for a delay in the shareholder vote.Based on the sweetened Baker offer of $11 a share, Catalyst would post a return of 8.8 per cent on the shares it bought in August. Catalyst also snapped up stock sold by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan in June for $9.45 a piece, resulting in a potential 16 per cent gain.

Still, Catalyst missed much of the upside in the stock by buying the bulk of its shares after Baker’s first bid in June at $9.45 each. Before that offer, the stock traded as low as $6.22 on June 7.The Catalyst representative said that “should the transaction be completed, the return will be materially higher than what Bloomberg’s calculation attempts to show.” He said the calculation is missing several key data points.Tough YearThe potential deals follow a tough year for Catalyst, which specializes in buying the debt of troubled companies — a world Glassman once described as a “blood sport.” His publicly traded debt unit — Callidus Capital Corp. — was taken private for just 75 cents a share in October after mounting losses from bad loans pushed it to the brink of insolvency. Catalyst, which owns 70 per cent of Callidus, took the lender public in 2014 at $14 a share.“It’s clear it is a sad story and nobody is trying to put a different spin on it,” David Sutin, chair of the special committee of Callidus’s board, said after shareholders approved the bid from U.K. billionaire Joe Lewis to buy out minority shareholders for about $5 million.In numerous court filings over the years, Catalyst has blamed Callidus’s woes on a systematic attack by dozens of Bay Street short-sellers, dubbing them the “Wolfpack conspirators.” Callidus said in a recent regulatory filing that the shorts sought to “materially impair” its business, which hurt its ability to originate new loans and raise financing.Some Catalyst investors have since grown cautious, worried that the troubles at Callidus Capital could spill over to the private equity firm, according to people familiar with the situation. They showed little appetite to put more money into a potential new fund — what would have been the firm’s sixth — that Glassman had planned to raise in 2017, according to several people familiar with the plan, including those who were sounded out on the fund. Plans for the so-called Fund VI were referenced in a report for a fund annual meeting on April 4, 2017. The fund was never put in place, and no papers were filed.The Catalyst representative said the firm never attempted to raise money for a new fund, calling it “completely false.” The terms of its previous fund, Fund V, restricted it from initiating fundraising.“This is an attempt to express a failure in something that has never occurred,” the official said.Investors in the earlier Fund III are now being asked to wait another year to get their money back, giving Catalyst more time to sell assets including Advantage Rent A Car, according to a fund update sent to backers last month. The US$1-billion fund is now targeting the end of 2020 for a return of money, rather than the end of 2019, according to the update. The fund was started in 2009. Catalysts’ backers include a long list of blue-chip investors including the Rockefeller Foundation, which declined to comment for this article, and the Arizona State Retirement System, which didn’t respond to requests for comment.The Catalyst representative objected to this “misinformed characterization. The automatic one-year extension is not a delay, it is a contemplated aspect of our LP agreement as a means to allow for the maximization of returns, which has been agreed to, and supported by, our LPs.” LPs refer to limited partners in the funds.Ira Gluskin, a Canadian money manager and a former director of the University of Toronto’s asset management arm that invests with Catalyst, expressed his frustration at a conference last year, saying he is an “unhappy investor” who wants his money back, according to a Globe and Mail report at the time. Gluskin declined to comment for this story.Bloomberg.com"

“The current tightness of the market looks real,” Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note. “As a result, we expect some further upward pressure on prices in coming months, and some further upward pressure on household debt to flow from that.”New listings in Canada were down 1.8 per cent in December and are 8% below the 2019 high reached in April, while the sales-to-new listings ratio is the highest since 2004, CREA reported. The ratio for Ottawa hit a record in December, while in Montreal it climbed to the highest since 2003.Barring an unforeseen change in recent trends, “price gains appear poised to accelerate in 2020,” CREA officials said in the statement.The dwindling supply is boosting prices and curtailing overall transactions. The national benchmark price rose 0.8 per cent in December, climbing for a seventh straight month, a period over which home values have increased almost 5 per cent. Home sales, meanwhile, fell last month for the first time since February, extending a recent slowdown.Sales in Toronto dropped 3 per cent in December, with new listings in that market down 5.7 per cent.Even with the recent slowdown, national home sales for all of 2019 rose 6.5 per cent from the previous year, reflecting stronger demand from lower interest rates, a strong labour market and rising population. Still, sales remain well below their 2016 peak.Bloomberg.com"

Investors are eager to see cannabis companies report profits, rewarding the few that have and punishing those that haven’t.However, it will take a few more quarters before the industry can generate predictable results, said CEO Greg Engel.

“I still think we’re not going to hit any sense of normalcy or predictability until the fourth quarter of this year,” Engel said in a phone interview.One of the biggest unknowns is how Canada’s rollout of newly legal products including vapes and edibles will go. Engel said Organigram has already seen provinces submit reorders for its vapes, which hit shelves on Dec. 17, and one province tripled its initial order for Organigram’s chocolates, which won’t begin selling until later this quarter.The company acquired a high-capacity chocolate production line in October and would be willing to do white-label manufacturing for other companies, Engel said.Organigram will also continue to sell its cannabis to third parties, he said. The company booked an unexpected $9.2 million in wholesale revenue in the first quarter as its competitors showed a willingness to pay for high-quality product, the main reason it was able to beat revenue estimates.“We’ve had multiple companies come to us who are more reliant on this model both as a strategy and/or in the near term and we saw it as a diversification opportunity,” he said.Analysts applauded the quarter and said Organigram appears to be one of the better-positioned Canadian pot producers.“We are pleasantly surprised to see Organigram beat our estimates, as well as the street’s; Organigram has successfully sidestepped industry roadblocks that some of its peers have met, violently, head-on,” Raymond James analyst Rahul Sarugaser said in upgrading the stock to outperform from market perform. “We believe clear skies are visible on Organigram’s horizon.”Bloomberg.com"

Valuations for big caps were at 1.45 standard deviations above their long-term average and the highest since the tech bubble as of mid-January. For smaller companies, they were 0.83 standard deviations above their own mean, they said, citing RBC’s multi-factor model.

“When we look at positioning in U.S. equities generally in the futures market, we continue to find that it is highly euphoric,” Calvasina wrote. “Unlike large caps, which look highly overvalued, small-cap valuations continue to look only modestly overvalued relative to history.”For a small-cap breakout to sustain, more evidence of healing in the industrial economy is needed, Calvasina said. Since smaller companies tend to be seen as a domestic U.S. play, they might be expected to thrive when forecasts for the American economy are strengthening. Their shares didn’t benefit as much as they should have from the Federal Reserve’s easing moves last year, and the stocks should be supported by stabilization in measures like freight shipments, she added.Calvasina notes that high debt burdens and low earnings quality are “valid reasons” to still be nervous about small caps, but she says the way to deal with this is to prefer active management in the space because it can help steer around those issues via company selection.Bloomberg.com

To transport it, producers must blend in more of a lighter crude called condensate, thereby reducing the volume that can be shipped by pipeline and increasing transportation costs, according to Kevin Birn, IHS Markit’s director of North American crude oil markets.At the same time, trains that are shipping crude out of the pipeline-bottlenecked region must move slower in the chillier weather. Local demand for the oil is also threatened. On Tuesday, operations at Imperial Oil Ltd.’s refinery near Edmonton were disrupted due to the cold weather, the company said.

Oilsands benchmark Western Canadian Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate futures was at US$24.50 a barrel on Wednesday, the widest in more than a year. Edmonton Mixed Sweet crude’s discount is also at the weakest in more than a year as is light synthetic crude that’s produced from oil sands bitumen processed in an upgrader.To be sure, oil is facing more headwinds than just the weather, Birn said. Inventories rose to a record in November after a pipeline shutdown and rail strike, according to Genscape. Stockpiles remain at “very high levels,” which means that even as pipeline takeaway and rail capacity increases, there are few “shock absorbers” to deal with sudden disruptions.Bloomberg.com

The stake — worth US$1 billion at the time — is now worth more than US$1.6 billion. The stock has surged 25 per cent in just the first two weeks of 2020 as fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries exceeded estimates and Musk started handing over locally assembled cars to customers in China.For most of 2019, Ellison’s investment was floundering as Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, bounced from crisis to crisis and Wall Street cast skepticism on consumer demand. On the day Ellison’s holding and his appointment to the board were disclosed, the shares closed at US$333.87. By June, they had plunged to a low US$176.99. On Tuesday, they rose 3.4 per cent to US$542.69 at 9:46 a.m. in New York.

The rally is bringing Tesla even closer to a US$100-billion market capitalization, the threshold that would unlock the first tranche of Musk’s all-or-nothing pay package approved in March 2018. The company will have to sustain that value for months for the CEO to get his award worth around US$346 million.At least one investor may have less reason to rejoice. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund hedged most of its 5 per cent stake in Tesla through an arrangement with JPMorgan Chase & Co. last January, according to the Financial Times. That helped protect gains when the share price was below about US$350, but the kingdom would have missed out on the recent rally, assuming the hedge remained in place.Musk himself has most to cheer. His fortune has swelled by US$3.9 billion so far this month through Monday, boosting his net worth to US$31.5 billion and making him the world’s 28th-richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Bloomberg.com"

Cookies are little bits of code that stick in peoples’ browsers and follow them around the web and are a core part of the online advertising landscape. They allow advertisers to target people with ads for websites they previously visited and make it easier to determine how effective certain ads were in getting internet surfers to buy something.Apple Inc.’s Safari and Mozilla Corp.’s Firefox browsers already block third-party cookies, but Google has argued in the past those approaches are too heavy-handed and risk cutting into vital revenue for internet publishers. In the blog post, Chrome Engineering Director Justin Schuh said blocking third-party cookies could have “unintended consequences that can negatively impact both users and the web ecosystem.” The company is seeking input from advertisers, publishers and Chrome users as it works to find ways to help support advertising online while still preserving privacy.

“Users are demanding greater privacy — including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used — and it’s clear the web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands,” Schuh said.Google has talked about this approach before. While Apple and Mozilla don’t derive much money from advertising, the vast majority of Google’s revenue comes from digital ads. It’s in the company’s interest to keep advertisers spending more money on its websites and ad products. Google’s empire was built on its ability to provide targeted advertising.Google is navigating a thicket of threats to its business though, including a rising demand for greater privacy and government investigations into whether its business practices in the ad tech world are anti-competitive. If it shuts advertisers out from its system too much, they could increase their complaints that it’s being unfair.

That breakneck pace has prompted a rush by Wall Street analysts to raise targets and caused short investors’ losses to pile up.Shares have more than doubled since mid-October, helped by a surprise third-quarter profit, strong deliveries for the fourth quarter, the quick construction of its China plant and a general improvement in analysts’ sentiment. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 1.6 per cent so far this year.The dizzying stock increase has left analysts playing catch up. After a string of price target boosts earlier this month, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank were the latest to raise their targets on Tesla significantly.

Jefferies’ Philippe Houchois bumped up his target to US$600 from US$400 on Tuesday, saying it would be wrong to exit Tesla on valuation since it is the only carmaker “engaged in a positive-sum game in electric vehicles amid rising market acceptance.” He expects Tesla’s auto business to turn profitable this year. Houchois maintained his buy rating on the stock.Deutsche Bank increased its target to US$455 from US$290 and maintained a hold rating, saying the company “truly seems to be currently firing on all cylinders,” citing the recent start of China production, an emissions-pooling deal with Fiat Chrysler, the upcoming start of Model Y production and the building of a Europe factory.“But with the stock hovering around all-time highs, we worry investor sentiment has gotten bullish too fast, ignoring some of the nearer-term execution risks,” Deutsche Bank said, noting that the China market is difficult to gauge in the near term due to a recent slump in new-energy vehicles.Tesla’s fourth-quarter deliveries benefited from the expiration of electric car incentives in several markets, and therefore demand could moderate during the first quarter in some key geographies, Deutsche Bank said.The sudden acceleration in Tesla shares is proving costly for one corner of the market — the short sellers who stand to make money when a stock goes down. According to financial analytics firm S3 Partners, bearish Tesla investors have racked up US$2.8 billion in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020, including US$1.25 billion in losses just on Monday’s 9.8 per cent advance. This compares with losses of US$2.89 billion for all of 2019.“With 2020 losses mounting, we should see a continuation and probably an acceleration of Tesla’s multi-month short squeeze,” S3’s Ihor Dusaniwsky wrote in a note.Tesla’s short interest is now about 20 per cent of its free float, according to S3, down from 36.4 per cent in early June.However, the surge is also making some brace for an eventual decline in the stock.“There is a euphoric atmosphere around shares of Tesla which often results in sharp near-term declines,” said Gene Munster, managing partner of the venture capital firm Loup Ventures. Ultimately, the company’s valuation “needs to be grounded in consistent earnings, something that may be years away in the Tesla story.”Bloomberg.com"

The additive is popping up beyond the new sandwich undergoing trials in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Houston, as well as appearing at other locations in tests of sausage, soup bases and different crispy-chicken fillets.Chicken is a big deal in fast food. Americans eat more of it each year than any other meat, and consumption is growing.

It’s now commonly associated with takeout food and processed soups and meats.

The trial will continue for a few more weeks. It’s also testing a Portuguese sausage and a soup base with added MSG in select locations in Hawaii, as well as more crispy chicken fillets in Augusta, Georgia, and Seattle.“We use real, quality ingredients to elevate the taste of our food so our customers all over the world can enjoy,” McDonald’s chief nutritionist Cindy Goody said in a statement. “We’re passionate about our food and take great care to offer delicious, quality menu options to our customers that are produced and sourced in a responsible way.”In the past four years, the Chicago-based company has tried to clean up its ingredients including removing artificial preservatives from its chicken nuggets.

Millennials have simply delayed that step, but are now beginning to get them in numbers equal to or higher than their car-loving baby boomer parents. At 84 million strong, they now outnumber boomers, with about 20 per cent more births per year.

“The impact on the auto sector from the millennial generation could be as great as the impression the baby boomers had on the industry in the 1980s,” Mike Ward, Benchmark’s auto analyst, wrote in the report. “Over the last five years, there were 15.4 million new drivers in the U.S., the biggest comparable increase since the 1974-78 period.”The first millennials reached 35 in 2016, toward the beginning of the auto industry’s record five consecutive years of at least 17 million U.S. vehicle sales. Traditionally, license rates begin to peak when people reach their mid-30s and millennials are no different. They are having babies, buying SUVs and moving to the suburbs.“We believe underlying demographics support normal demand of 16.5-17 million units annually over the next 5-10 years,” Ward wrote.Licensed drivers will grow by 12.5 million people in the U.S. over the next five years, Benchmark forecast. By 2025, there will likely be a record 245 million licensed drivers in the U.S. That could result in an extra 3 million vehicle sales a year.“The key demographic group of people aged 35-44 years continues to grow until 2034 and could provide growth for the industry for the next decade,” the report said.Young people continue to be slow to get their driver’s license. In 2018, just 25.6 per cent of 16-year-olds were licensed to drive, down from 46.2 per cent in 1983, according to a study by Michael Sivak of Green Car Congress.

The modification gave producers increased access to storage during periods of maintenance on the system, damping pricing volatility during the often turbulent summer and fall seasons.

Currently, there’s only one government-approved farm at the University of Mississippi that grows pot for research purposes.The Drug Enforcement Administration said in August that it would propose new regulations for growing marijuana for scientific and medical research, and would then make decisions on pending applications from growers. It first invited those applications in 2016.Attorney General William Barr pledged in April to act on those pending applications, and said he was “pleased” the DEA was moving forward in August.Then things stalled, said Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who sent a bipartisan letter to Barr last month urging the DEA to allow researchers to obtain products from state-legal dispensaries.“The deadline for response was Dec. 20 and they did not get back to us,” Schatz said in a phone interview. “This is another ominous sign that this administration opposes not just rescheduling or descheduling or decriminalization, but anything that has to do with cannabis, they’re fighting it.”Schatz said he believes Congress can pass marijuana research legislation in 2020.If it can’t, Hodgin said his company is prepared to import more cannabis.“I would much rather all of those tax dollars and intellectual property and job creation stay here in America, but if the federal government continues to be defined by inertia, then I suppose we’ll have to look outside the United States for our research materials,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

Tehran vows retribution and oil prices jump almost 5 per cent as traders rush to cover the risk of a Middle East war. Then the selling starts.It’s a trading pattern that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, but has become increasingly familiar. The threat of conflict loomed over the heart of the global oil market this past week, but the usual panic buying by traders and consumers was met quickly by a wave of U.S. shale drillers grasping the opportunity to lock in prices for future production.The sudden price spike was blunted, and when the dust settled the plunge back down was steep.These trades, known as hedges, combined with a massive expansion of oil stockpiles in Asia and surging U.S. crude exports, are the recipe for a market that’s capable of quickly shrugging off disruptions that until recently were considered nightmare scenarios.

Oil losing its geopolitical lustre as markets shrug off Iran conflict
“When prices spike in response to geopolitical events, producers tend to lay on more hedges,” said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The higher the price the more they hedge,” which makes any increase short-lived, he said.West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has slipped back below US$60 a barrel as the last of the gains from President Donald Trump’s standoff with Iran faded. That didn’t just reflect the easing tensions after Tehran’s retaliation for the killing of General Qassem Soleimani inflicted no U.S. casualties. It was a manifestation of how the shale revolution has changed the psychology of the market.The same day that American missiles killed Iran’s most important military leader near Baghdad airport, the U.S. Energy Information Administration announced record net oil exports of 1.73 million barrels a day. That’s a historic change for a country that a decade ago was one of the world’s biggest importers, and it has transformed the way the market responds to a crisis.The shale boom that triggered this shift has been led by a multitude of independent drillers that are less able to absorb the financial impact of price swings than giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. or Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Unlike the era that was dominated by the supermajors, any oil rally today finds a natural seller as smaller companies minimize their risks by hedging.Crude prices are in the “sweet spot” for many North American producers, RBC Capital Markets analysts including Michael Tran wrote in a note. Many of them had been waiting, or hoping, for a chance to lock in WTI prices for 2020 at US$60 a barrel, a level that was pierced after the Soleimani killing.Occidental Petroleum Corp., one of the largest drillers in the prolific Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico, revealed this week it had increased its production hedges for 2020 from 300,000 to 350,000 barrels a day with the help of Wall Street banks.“Hedging activity has been robust over recent weeks,” RBC said. “Volumes should only pick up as the price rally coincides with improving liquidity with the holiday season in the rear view mirror.”Each burst of hedging gives a boost to U.S. oil producers, potentially allowing them to maintain higher output at a time when analysts are expecting shale growth to taper. Later this year, some of the crude linked to these contracts may fill the network of pipelines, terminals and ports connected to U.S. Gulf Coast, further solidifying America’s position as an energy-exporting powerhouse that offers a low-risk alternative to Middle Eastern oil.Trump himself highlighted this shift in his Jan. 8 White House press conference after Iran’s retaliatory missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Iraq, saying that America is “independent and we do not need Middle East oil.”While the president’s boast is an exaggeration, the region’s dominance as an exporter has receded. Exports from the Middle East and North Africa accounted for 38 per cent of the oil moved around the world in 2018, down from 43 per cent a decade earlier, according to data from BP Plc.Though some countries have boosted production capacity, others like Iran and Libya have seen theirs slashed by sanctions and conflict. In contrast, since the middle of the last decade the U.S. has seen its own oil exports soar from effectively zero to more than 3 million barrels a day — more than is shipped by any Middle East producer besides Iraq and Saudi Arabia.A significant proportion of that crude is reaching Asia, the region that’s historically been most dependent on energy supplies from the Persian Gulf. Those alternative supplies, combined with a significant expansion in oil stockpiles, mean the region is better placed to withstand disruption.China, the world’s biggest oil importer, has built a massive government-owned stockpile that can protect it from short-term supply shocks. Its petroleum reserves have grown from about 191 million barrels in the middle of 2015 to about 800 million in September, according to Bloomberg calculations based on government statements. Saudi Arabia has also built up stockpiles in the past decade, including capacity for more than 8 million barrels on Japan’s Okinawa island.“Emerging-market crude inventories are much higher than they have been historically, especially in Saudi and China,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Jeffrey Currie said in a Jan. 6 note. “Both countries are already demonstrating their willingness to use these to stabilize supply and prices.”The muted reaction to the Soleimani crisis was the second time in just a few months that the market shrugged off serious turmoil in the Middle East. The strike on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil-processing facility in September — which the U.S. blamed on Iran — was the single biggest supply disruption in history, but the ensuing price surge fizzled out just two weeks later as the facility was repaired.To be sure, both the attack on the kingdom and the assassination of Soleimani weren’t long-lasting crises, and fall back in prices also reflected the diminishing risk to supplies. But they were still major events compared with the kind of rumours that could send crude soaring a decade ago, such as the report of an Israeli training exercise that helped propel crude to almost US$150 a barrel in the summer of 2008.Industry veterans who cut their teeth on supply disruptions, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq or the Gulf War of 1990 to 1991, are gradually being replaced by a younger generation whose careers developed in a world more accustomed to surplus than shortage.“The world is still coming to terms with this new resiliency that the U.S. producers can provide,” Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis Fannon said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Abu Dhabi. America is making a valuable contribution to global energy security, he said.Bloomberg.com"

Oil losing its geopolitical lustre as markets shrug off Iran conflict
From the Middle East to the BoC, Post’s annual outlook lunch tackles the tough questions for 2020
Relations between Iran and the West deteriorated after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general, Iran struck back with attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq, and a plane crashed near Tehran killing 176 people, including 63 Canadians. The Iranian government admitted Saturday it had mistakenly downed the jet, spreading anger across the globe. That was a dramatic reversal after the regime spent days accusing Western governments of “psychological warfare.”Weaker-than-expected jobs data from the U.S. did little to alter investor views that the economy remains fundamentally sound, while Canada’s rebound in employment backed the central bank’s view that the labour force continues to be resilient.That left equity bulls still in charge as they continue to look past the flare-up in tensions with Iran and focus on the potential for a pickup in global economic growth. And Canada is still listed as one of the four markets at the top of Bloomberg Intelligence’s global equity scorecard for 2020.EconomyCanadian jobs data released Friday showed employment rebounded in December after two straight months of declines. Employment grew by 320,300 this year, the second-most since 2007.“The small December rebound keeps the 3-month moving average in negative territory at -13K, which implies a slowdown in hiring after a year of strong gains,” said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.

Ultimately, Carey expects Aurora will be able to restructure the covenants, “a big step in helping investor confidence.”

Aurora said it’s looking at all options to strengthen its balance sheet. “Senior management is working diligently to rationalize our business to the realities of the short-term market while positioning Aurora for the significant long-term opportunity ahead,” spokeswoman Michelle Lefler said in an emailed statement.Shares fell as much as 11 per cent in Toronto Friday, and are down 83 per cent from their high in March amid a broader slump in pot stocks.Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery also downgraded Aurora to underweight from neutral on Friday and cut his price target to US$1 from US$3, citing “notable risk” from its balance sheet position.Lavery pointed to a loan covenant that requires Aurora to keep its debt-to-Ebitda ratio below 4x after Sept. 30 of this year, and said he doesn’t expect it to reach that level until the second half of calendar 2022. He also cautioned that Aurora is likely to generate negative cash from operations until the fiscal third quarter of 2021.“We project a $200-million cash deficit in the interim, which may prove difficult to finance in this capital environment,” Lavery said.Earlier this week, Scott Willis at Toronto-based research firm Grizzle said Aurora could be headed for “technical default” if it fails to meet its covenants. He expects Aurora to write down more than $2 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, sending its equity value below the minimum required in the debt covenants.Aurora does have a $400 million at-the-market equity distribution program that it can tap, but that would further dilute shareholders who already saw the value of their shares reduced by about 6% when the company restructured its convertible debentures in November.Last month, Aurora said Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley had stepped down. It’s also deferred construction at two facilities in Denmark and Alberta, which is expected to save approximately $200 million of cash in the near term.Bloomberg.com"

Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss said the company was rising like a “rocket ship,” a growing number of investors are betting its shares are earthbound.Shares have fallen after each of the past four earnings reports, and the stock lost 17 per cent last year. That’s turned the US$1,000-parka company into a magnet for short sellers who would profit if the shares decline further.Bulls see the Toronto-based company’s foray into lighter apparel, like sweaters and rain coats, and its entry into new markets as evidence that there’s still plenty of market to tap. Bears, however, worry about inventories piling up, slower sales growth, and unpredictable profit margins. This makes 2020 a key year for Canada Goose. If there’s a time for the company to refresh its image with investors, it’s now.

Canada Goose plunge gives short sellers reason to celebrate as they erase year-to-date losses
“Canada Goose is still a relatively small brand, with about two thirds of its sales in North America,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Maxime Boucher said. “It must use the next few quarters to establish itself as a top global luxury player.”While the company is expanding in Asia and Europe with new flagship stores and country-focused websites, its inventories are swelling — raising questions about whether production is outpacing demand. Canada Goose needs to bring them back to more normal levels soon “to reassure investors that its brand remains hot and suited to a luxury model of limited supply,” Boucher said.The company declined to comment for the story.This is being closely watched by the markets, as evidenced by analysts’ disagreement last month on whether discounts were deepening on Canada Goose parkas. Markdowns are rare for luxury companies that rely on scarcity and cachet to get shoppers to pay full price.‘Completely Different’Canada Goose stock trades at about 25 times estimated annual profit per share. That’s similar to Moncler SpA, a competing high-end ski jacket maker with higher price tags that’s based in Milan. Critics say that valuation is too high.“People seem to think that it’s Moncler 2.0,” said Brian McGough, a managing director at research firm Hedgeye who’s recommended shorting the stock since May. “It’s not. It’s a completely different business model in every way, shape, and form.”McGough said brands like Moncler keep demand high by limiting the supply of merchandise. Canada Goose, in contrast, produces as much as it can and assumes the market will absorb it, which increases the chance that goods will ultimately need to get discounted, he said.A slew of new products, such as US$500 hoodies, elevates that risk, according to McGough, who sees outdoor-gear maker Columbia Sportswear Co. as a better-suited comparison for valuation. Columbia trades at about 21 times earnings.Canada Goose U.S.-listed shares have a total of about 15.6 million with short positions — more than triple the levels at the start of 2019, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC. That’s more than a quarter of the company’s float, and all together represents about US$545 million of its market capitalization, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s head of predictive analytics.Healthy SalesDespite the rise in investors betting against the shares, Canada Goose’s business remains healthy. The company expects growth of at least 25 per cent for profit and at least 20 per cent for revenue this fiscal year — an enviable pace in the struggling retail sector. Ten analysts recommend buying the stock, against four hold ratings and one sell.The six-decade-old company with the North Pole crest logo is relying less on wholesalers by selling directly to consumers. Despite protests in Hong Kong, sales in China almost doubled last quarter.“Brand integrity remains intact in our view,” Evercore ISI analysts led by Omar Saad wrote in a note to clients last month, after finding no signs of meaningful discounting on the ground.Mixed MessagesIncreased scrutiny over Canada Goose’s use of coyote-fur trim, and ongoing protests against it, has also weighed on the stock. But part of last year’s drop seems to be a self-inflicted wound that’s related to executives failing to communicate clearly.Canada Goose’s earnings projections, for example, have repeatedly proved to be conservative in the past, leading investors to expect markedly higher numbers. So last May, when fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts’ average estimate for the first time since the company went public in 2017, the stock tumbled 31 per cent.Then in November, shares reversed gains and fell when the company said that wholesale revenue would decline by a percentage “in the mid-teens” in the third quarter — traditionally the most important period. The company said the drop could be attributed to some orders being fulfilled earlier in the season. At the same time, a 61 per cent jump in inventories exacerbated investors’ concerns.“Demand remains exceptional, but communication leaves our feathers ruffled,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note to investors at the time. “While management excels as operators, poor communication with the Street is weighing on the stock,” he said.Canada Goose’s Reiss sought to dispel concerns on the November call by noting that the timing of wholesale shipments varies every year and is unrelated to underlying demand. The inventory bump is related to a plan to maximize production efficiency as the company brings more of the manufacturing in-house, he added.Even so, the company’s stock has fallen about 15 per cent since and short positions rose quickly in November.Analysts are hoping for clearer signs going forward.“More visibility on its financial strategy would help,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Boucher said.Bloomberg.com"

International fugitive Carlos Ghosn has tales to tell and scores to settle — and now he can
‘Mission Impossible’In fiery, freewheeling form at a two-and-a-half hour press conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Ghosn, 65, repeatedly proclaimed his innocence against allegations he understated his income and raided corporate resources for personal gain, accused Japanese prosecutors, government officials and Nissan Motor Co. executives of conspiring to topple him, and insisted he would clear his name.“I am used to what you call mission impossible,” he said in response to questions from the assembled reporters. “You can expect me in the next weeks to take some initiatives to tell you how I’m going to clear my name.”That might include a tell-all book. Ghosn plans to publish the story of his arrest, according to a report by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.His downfall has already seen him lose millions in payouts. Last year, Nissan cancelled retirement and stock-linked compensation and Renault SA said he won’t benefit from a non-compete agreement he signed in 2015 and stock-based payments that were conditional on his staying at the company. Many of the charges against him centre on retirement payments, totalling more than US$140 million, which he hadn’t yet received.French InvestigationsThat may be just the start. French investigations examining the possible misuse by Ghosn of Renault’s money to host lavish parties and pay consulting fees are at a preliminary stage. The former auto executive was already hit with a US$1-million penalty as part of a September settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose the retirement payments.At his press conference, Ghosn claimed he had done nothing untoward in hosting an event at the Palace of Versailles. Regarding the SEC fine, Ghosn’s lawyers said previously, “We are pleased to have resolved this matter in the U.S. with no findings or admission of wrongdoing.”Ghosn’s U.S. law firm, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP, declined to comment on Bloomberg’s wealth estimates or on the SEC settlement. Ghosn’s Lebanese lawyer also declined to comment.Nissan is looking at bringing legal action against Ghosn in Lebanon, people familiar with the company’s plans said, to recover money it claims he used improperly. The carmaker is trying to evict him from the pink villa in Beirut to which he still has access. Nissan purchased it for US$8.75 million, renovated it and furnished it for him, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Ghosn’s flight will not affect Nissan’s basic policy of holding him responsible for the serious misconduct uncovered by the internal investigation,” the Yokohama-based automakeer said on Tuesday.Authorities may be looking to seize some of his assets. In Switzerland, where Ghosn reportedly banks with Julius Baer Group Ltd., Swiss authorities received a legal-aid request from the Tokyo District Attorney’s Office a year ago, a spokeswoman for the agency that received the notice said. It examined the request before forwarding it to the Zurich prosecutor’s office in March. A spokesman for the Zurich prosecutor’s office declined to comment on the nature of the request or what they are doing with it.At Japan’s request, Interpol issued a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn’s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive.It’s not clear if any of Ghosn’s assets have been seized. In criminal court cases in Japan, a defendant’s assets cannot be frozen or confiscated until a court verdict is reached, according to Taichi Yoshikai, a law professor at Kokushikan University. There are exceptions in civil cases, but it’s unclear how this will be applied when a defendant is overseas, he said.Wealth AssumptionsThe Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which rarely makes public comments, posted an English-language statement on its website Thursday saying Ghosn had only himself to blame for his strict bail conditions. It vowed to bring him to justice in Japan. Ghosn had been “propagating both within Japan and internationally false information on Japan’s legal system and its practice,” Justice Minister Masako Mori said.Renault declined to comment.Bloomberg’s calculation of Ghosn’s net worth assumes none of his assets at the time of his arrest — which included shares in Renault and Nissan now valued at about US$60 million — have been seized or sold.Even if that is the case, the costs that come with being the world’s most famous runaway will continue to be formidable. Legal bills for fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low came to US$15 million, according to an October deal with U.S. federal prosecutors. Efforts to burnish Low’s reputation cost US$1.1 million over seven months, according to the New York Times. Such expenses are likely sizeable enough to pressure even a fortune as large as that of the Ghosn family. Still, some costs may be lower than expected. The US$350,000 contract for Ghosn’s Osaka to Istanbul flight was to be paid in two tranches. The charter company has so far only received the first half.Bloomberg.com"

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It’s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.“It is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,” Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. “On the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.”

The remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada’s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation’s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy’s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.“We are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,” said Poloz. “In this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.”Outside of trade, Poloz said the country’s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation’s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation’s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn’t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"

The retail industry has been one of Microsoft’s most successful as the software maker tries to gain ground in cloud computing against market leader Amazon Web Services and lure more customers to its internet-based Office products. Some retailers are loath to work with e-commerce rival Amazon. Nadella and Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian are set to speak next week at the annual show of the National Retail Federation, the biggest retail trade group, underscoring how significant the industry is to Amazon’s biggest cloud competitors.“A key part of our offering is that we partner and we don’t compete,” said Shelley Bransten, the vice president who oversees Microsoft’s work with retailers and consumer goods companies. But there are other benefits to working closely with retailers, she said in an interview. Some of the software products built for retailers will be useful for companies in other industries.For example, the walkie-talkie feature in Teams can help manufacturers, said Emma Williams, a Microsoft vice president who is charged with adding features to Office and Teams for use by customers in health care, retail, manufacturing and finance.Microsoft explained the new features in a blog post Thursday ahead of Nadella’s speech in New York, the CEO’s first appearance at the retail conference.Retail customers are also key to Microsoft’s competition with Salesforce, the leader in cloud-based customer relations software. Microsoft announced the official release of its Dynamics Commerce software for helping retailers manage inventory, scheduling, call centres, e-commerce sites and in-store operations. The company said outerwear maker Canada Goose Holdings Inc. has been using it.Microsoft also provided new details on how some previously announced Azure customers are working with its products. One year ago, Microsoft said Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. would begin using Azure and deploy Microsoft 365 — a collection of software that includes Windows 10, Office cloud services and security and mobile-management software — to the pharmacy giant’s more than 380,000 workers. Now Walgreens will try Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 goggles for worker training and the drugstore chain also is using Microsoft products to anonymously track shoppers’ steps, in order to better plan store layouts.Microsoft is also targeting another lucrative Amazon business — digital advertising for products on retailers’ websites. In August, Microsoft acquired New York-based PromoteIQ, which helps companies like Kroger Co. and Kohl’s Corp. sell ads on their websites to companies who want prime placement for their goods.

After surging to another record close Tuesday, the stock climbed as much as 4.2 per cent on Wednesday, boosting the company’s market value to more than US$88 billion — more than Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. combined.A bit more good news could push it to US$100 billion — the threshold that will unlock the first tranche of Musk’s all-or-nothing moonshot award. On paper, it will net him about US$346 million. A Tesla representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.Musk, whose US$29.3 billion fortune is mostly tied up in Tesla stock, has had a spring in his step lately. He danced on stage Tuesday at Tesla’s factory outside Shanghai to celebrate delivering the first Model 3 sedans to public customers in China. He spent New Year’s Eve at the company’s car-assembly plant in Fremont, California, closing out a quarter in which Tesla delivered a record 112,000 cars.

Elon Musk reveals how he saved Tesla from bankruptcy while ramping up Model 3 production
It’s a sharp reversal from mid-2019, when the shares languished as Wall Street grew increasingly skeptical about consumer demand and Musk called for a “hardcore” review of expenses after cutting thousands of jobs.Musk’s pay package is believed to be the largest executive compensation deal in history. It’s structured the same way as his two previous pay plans, consisting of a trove of stock options that vest in increments if ambitious goals are met.But the size and scope of the most recent award is unprecedented. It outlines plans for Tesla to grow its market value to US$650 billion and increase revenue and adjusted earnings by multiples. At stake for Musk is 20.2 million options that could net him more than US$50 billion if all targets are met, according to Tesla’s estimates. He gets no salary or bonuses.The pay plan drew sharp criticism from shareholder-advisory firms but was approved by an overwhelming majority of Tesla investors in March 2018.Milestones AchievedWithin a year, the company achieved two of the milestones for Musk’s award: it brought in more than US$20 billion in aggregate revenue over four quarters and booked more than US$1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over that span. It also said the next Ebitda threshold — US$3 billion — is within reach.For Tesla to achieve a US$100 billion market value, its stock must climb to $554.80, based on the current number of shares outstanding. But it’s not a one-day event: the terms of Musk’s award require that both the six-month trailing share price average, as well as the 30-day trailing average, exceed that figure before the first tranche of options is released.The tranche consists of 1.69 million options that would net Musk around US$346 million if he exercised them and sold the shares immediately at the threshold share price, which could be a welcome payday for a billionaire who told a jury last month that he’s short on cash.However, that’s an unlikely scenario. He hasn’t sold a single share of Tesla for years, apart from unloading US$593 million of stock in 2016 to pay income taxes.Bloomberg.com"

Only 33 per cent said a recession is unlikely, with 12 per cent unsure.While the public’s concerns are at odds with economist projections for at least some modest growth in 2020, the downbeat perceptions reflect a pervasive sense of caution that has dogged the country’s households for more than a year and impacted their behaviour. 
Weak loonie, low borrowing costs to create ‘tug of war’ for business investment in 2020: Deloitte
Forecasting Canada’s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets
Tories’ ‘made-in-Canada’ recession narrative is only resonating because the Liberals have a lousy script
Saddled with some of the highest household debt levels in the world, Canadians have already slowed their spending to the weakest in at least half a century, in part because they are saving more to brace for a potential hit. That’s bad news for an economy that’s been relying heavily on the consumer to drive growth, given the country’s weak investment and export record over the past decade.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say“Canada’s expansion will be lacklustre in 2020, with drags from debt-laden consumers, global trade risks and lingering business uncertainty. The open economy is not immune to slower growth in the U.S. or broader global manufacturing malaise. A solid labour market and incremental policy stimulus should prevent a slowdown from turning into something worse.”— Andrew Husby, Bloomberg Economics.Excluding housing, annual growth in total household consumption — everything from the purchase of televisions to spending on health care — has averaged 1.1 per cent in real terms over the past four quarters, the slowest pace outside recession since at least 1962. Another sign of cautiousness: savings rates are inching higher and are now at the highest since 2015.Talk of a global recession in financial markets had been rife for much of last year, but those worries have faded significantly in recent weeks amid signs the global economy is stabilizing — helped by receding trade war risks between China and the U.S. and looser monetary policy in much of the world. At the same time, whatever growth there is will be modest.Economists predict Canada’s economy will expand by a tepid 1.6 per cent this year, about the same as 2019. The U.S. economy is seen slowing to 1.8 per cent growth from 2.3 per cent in 2019.There are also indications that consumer worries have levelled off. The results are little changed from a similar poll taken at the end of November. A separate gauge of consumer confidence — the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index — saw a rebound in December from a two-month slide, as financial markets surged at the end of last year and sentiment around real estate recovered.Recession concerns are most pronounced in prairie provinces like Alberta, where almost three-quarters of households see a chance of a 2020 contraction. A majority of respondents in British Columbia and Ontario are also concerned a downturn is imminent. Quebec was the only province where optimists outnumbered pessimists.The results of the current survey are based on a hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,010 Canadians, between Dec. 22 and Dec. 29, and have a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Respondents were asked whether they thought a recession was likely, somewhat likely, somewhat not likely or not at all likely.Bloomberg.com"

Wearing a dark suit and red tie, his hair gone mostly gray, Ghosn took questions from reporters from around the world, slipping easily between English, French, Arabic and Portuguese.

His flight from Japan, an escape worthy of a Hollywood spy thriller, marked the latest twist in a saga that began with his stunning arrest at Tokyo’s Haneda airport in November of 2018. Now free to speak his mind, the 65-year-old is seeking to salvage his legacy, blighted by allegations of understating his income and raiding corporate resources for personal gain at Nissan. He’s also under investigation in France.After more than a year in Japan’s criminal justice system, including months locked in a cell, Ghosn has scores to settle. Proclaiming his innocence, he accused Japanese prosecutors, government officials and Nissan executives of conspiring to topple him to prevent a further integration of the Japanese carmaker with Renault. Ghosn named former Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa, Hitoshi Kawaguchi, and Masakazu Toyoda as among those involved in the plot against him. Saikawa, Ghosn’s successor-turned-accuser, lost his job less than a year later over his own overcompensation scandal.

Ghosn was facing trials that could have landed him in prison for more than a decade when, last week, he bolted to Lebanon in a private jet from Osaka’s Kansai International Airport to escape what he described as a “rigged Japanese justice system.” The Mediterranean country doesn’t have an extradition agreement with Japan.

Now that he’s slipped from Japan’s grasp, Ghosn is taking his case to the court of public opinion — an arena where he gained a wealth of experience during two decades as one of the world’s most prominent and media-savvy business leaders.“I am here to expose a system of justice that violates the most basic principles of humanity,” Ghosn said at the press conference. “These allegations are untrue and I should never have been arrested.”Ghosn said he would stand trial “in any country where I believe I can receive a fair trial,” but didn’t think that was the case in Japan. He said his lawyers told him he might have had to spend five more years in the country before his case would be resolved.He laid the blame for his treatment not only on the prosecutors, but also on government officials, Nissan and its law firm. Because they leaked false information and withheld information that might have helped him, Ghosn said he was presumed guilty without the ability to clear his name. He said he didn’t believe Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was aware of the plot against him, and declined to identify other government officials to avoid creating a rift between Japan and Lebanon.“My unimaginable ordeal over the past 14 months was the result of an orchestrated campaign spearheaded by a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals at Nissan and at the Latham & Watkins law firm, with the support of the Tokyo prosecutor’s office,” Ghosn said.Conviction RateHis arrest cast an unflattering light on Japan’s legal system, where prosecutors can grill suspects repeatedly without their lawyers present and enjoy an almost 100 per cent conviction rate. Under the terms of Ghosn’s bail, the court had restricted contact with his family, including his wife Carole, with whom he was forbidden to speak without seeking permission. On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors pushed back, obtaining an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn on suspicion of giving false testimony.“This is exactly how it works,” Ghosn said, calling the move part of Japan’s intimidation tactics. Nissan also went on the offensive Tuesday, saying its internal investigation in the lead-up to Ghosn’s arrest found “incontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct” by the former executive. Nissan pledged to take “appropriate legal action” against him for any harm caused to the company.The carmaker has already spent more than US$200 million on lawyers, investigators, and digital forensics in its investigation of Ghosn and former executive Greg Kelly, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Kelly, who remains in Japan, has also denied wrongdoing.Ghosn helped lead Nissan back from the brink two decades ago, following its rescue by Renault. It made him a hero in Japan for a time, complete with a manga, or comic series, celebrating his corporate exploits. As the alliance between Renault and Nissan prospered — bringing in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in 2016 — Ghosn became the indispensable man at the center of the partnership.Yet his compensation led to persistent criticism in Japan and France, and resentment grew at Nissan over the lopsided shareholder structure that left Renault with 43 per cent of the Japanese carmaker, while Nissan owns just 15 per cent of Renault. Given its bigger size and superior earnings performance in recent years, Nissan has sought more sway in the alliance, including a reduction in Renault’s stake.Ghosn had harsh words for the performance of the carmakers and their partnership since his arrest, describing it as “a masquerade of an alliance which is going nowhere.” His pledge to “speak freely” has fuelled concern his remarks could rekindle the mutual suspicion that has plagued relations between the carmakers.QuickTakeEmerging accounts of Ghosn’s escape while under near round-the-clock surveillance have transfixed the business world.On Sunday, Dec. 29, he reportedly left his house in Tokyo, wearing a hat and a surgical-style mask, and took a bullet train to Osaka. That evening a Bombardier jet took off from the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport bound for Istanbul — with Ghosn apparently concealed in a large black case that was too big to fit into the airport’s baggage-scanning machines.Reaching Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, he changed planes while inside a box. The second jet took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.In Lebanon, where Ghosn grew up and has citizenship, he’s highly regarded for his business successes, and has even appeared on a postage stamp. Shortly after his arrest in Tokyo in 2018, a Beirut billboard proclaimed: “We are all Carlos Ghosn.”With assistance from Nour Al Ali, Tara Patel and Kenneth Wong.Bloomberg.com"

Dodig said he sees adjusted earnings growth in the “low-single-digit range” for 2020 as the company works back to its medium-term target range of 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth.In terms of acquisitions, Dodig said CIBC isn’t looking to do anything “dramatic” in the U.S., though “tuck-in acquisitions” in wealth management are likely.Bloomberg.com"

There’s some debate about how much impact marijuana legalization has on alcohol consumption, although surveys of pot users indicate that they tend to drink less when they’re high.

Annual sales based on the most recent monthly data would be $1.5 billion versus $9.2 billion for beer and $23 billion for alcohol.However, Azer said she expects Canada’s launch of newly legal pot products like vapes, edibles and cannabis beverages to “perpetuate this trend” of declining beer volumes, and said she favours cannabis over mainstream beer as an investment.Cannabis stocks have been on a steady downward trend since last spring.

Ignore the headlines, Canada’s labour market remains remarkably strong
All the reasons why Canada needs immigration — and more of it
The data show the two countries are relying on different drivers to counter the global trend of aging demographics. While Canada has turned to robust immigration to grow output, the U.S. has done a better job of tapping its domestic workforce and generating productivity gains.Which development model will prevail in 2020 remains to be seen. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News are giving the U.S. an edge, with growth projected at 1.8 per cent, versus 1.6 per cent in Canada. Both forecasts are much higher than the other five G7 countries, which are seen growing by an average 0.7 per cent.The boost from immigration, however, prompted one bank to predict Canada will leapfrog the U.S.Flattered by robust population increases of 1.5 per cent year-over-year, Canada’s headline growth could “easily” top the U.S. this year, “especially with some certainty on the USMCA, at long last,” Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Doug Porter said in a note, referring to the new North American trade deal.A Bright SpotCanada’s immigration-driven population boom has been one of the few bright spots for the economy, credited with supporting the labor force and the housing market. Without the population increases, the country would be tracking much slower growth given productivity gains have remained weak for years. Canada’s labor productivity is up 0.6 per cent from a year ago, versus 1.5 per cent in the U.S.Since 2015, the number of annual newcomers to Canada has more than doubled — the opposite of what’s happening in the U.S., where net international migration has dropped by almost half. Last year, the U.S. grew its population by 0.5 per cent — just one-third of Canada’s pace.Reasons behind the downward trajectory in the U.S. include fewer foreigners moving into the country, more foreigners leaving, and changes in Puerto Rican migration, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.More restrictive immigration policies from the Trump administration have also curbed interest from foreign students and workers, benefiting its neighbour to the north.Bloomberg.com"

In the following months, China imprisoned two Canadians on spying allegations, put another two on death row, and halted nearly $5 billion (US$3.8 billion) worth of Canadian agricultural imports.Global ConcernsPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has said a decision on whether to allow Huawei access to Canada’s next-generation network won’t be a political one. Meng is set to appear in court on Jan. 20 for the formal start of extradition hearings.European governments, including the U.K., are weighing restrictions on Huawei over fears that its systems could be accessed by Chinese intelligence to spy on other countries or disrupt communications, something the company denies. Australia has already banned the Shenzhen-based company from bidding on 5G contracts while the U.S. is pressing its allies to do the same. The Trump administration blacklisted the company in May, labelling it a threat to U.S. national security.Bibic said he’s awaiting a decision as the Canadian government reviews Huawei’s case. “Ultimately what we’d like is some clarity,” he said in an interview Monday from Montreal, adding the company will adjust accordingly regardless of the outcome.BCE, Canada’s biggest telecom firm by market value, rose as much as 0.9 per cent intraday Monday, the most since Dec. 4.

In September, shares of the company surged after people with knowledge of the matter said the miner was drawing preliminary takeover interest.In the December interview, Newall said the company hadn’t received any takeover approaches since it last refuted “speculation” it had been in talks about a bid in September.

That same day, Aurora said Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley would depart.Aurora determined that the greenhouse would have required “retrofit and significant capital investment in order to meet Aurora’s production standards,” company spokeswoman Michelle Lefler said in an emailed statement Monday. “Aurora has taken decisive steps to rationalize capital expenditures and align our cultivation footprint to current demand, including selling the Exeter facility.”

Kirk said he expects $2-billion worth of writedowns. Aurora’s market value was $2.8 billion at Friday’s close and the company had $3.9 billion of goodwill and intangibles on its balance sheet. “We believe more divestitures are likely, as Aurora has a major cash problem, and this listing only covers about two weeks of cash burn,” he added.The company mentioned the Exeter greenhouse in its 2018 annual report, citing 105,000 kilograms per year of cultivation capacity. However, it wasn’t mentioned in its 2019 annual report and hasn’t been mentioned in any press releases since the MedReleaf deal closed.“As far as we can tell, the facility was never licensed, and no product was ever sold from Exeter,” said Kirk, who rates Aurora a sell with a $2 price target.Aurora fell as much as 5.4 per cent Monday to $2.46.

During his long odyssey through the Japanese legal system — several arrests, more than 100 days in solitary confinement, seemingly endless interrogations, and, after his release on bail, intrusive 24-hour surveillance — Ghosn had been forced to accept many humiliations. But few demoralized the ousted leader of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA as much as having to seek court permission even to call his spouse, who prosecutors viewed as a potential co-conspirator in some of the wide range of financial crimes with which he’s been charged.Carole, who’d departed Japan in a hurry after her husband was taken into custody on a fourth charge in early April, has spent much of the last year lobbying tirelessly on his behalf — a campaign that was taking an obvious toll. “They’ve destroyed our lives, we are scarred forever,” she said of Ghosn’s accusers in a November interview with Bloomberg Television. “It’s been the hardest year of my life.” They were allowed to speak for one hour, but it wasn’t enough; they still had much more to say to each other. As time ran out, according to one of Ghosn’s lawyers, who described the call on his blog, the fallen executive signed off with a simple “I love you, habibi,” an Arabic term of affection.They've destroyed our lives, we are scarred foreverCarole Ghosn 
 
It seemed impossible to know when the couple would next have a chance to speak, let alone embrace. The following day, the 65-year-old Ghosn learned that the second of his two trials might begin only in 2021, raising the prospect of another year or more in court-imposed isolation. Even his children were being targeted by investigators. Japanese prosecutors had questioned Ghosn’s son Anthony, who was involved in some of the transactions they were targeting, as well as one of his daughters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fearing arrest, Anthony had been unable to visit his father.

Carlos Ghosn flees to Lebanon to escape Japan’s ‘rigged’ legal system
Ghosn’s prospects of proving his innocence in Japan were dismal. Prosecutors there win more than 99 per cent of the cases they try and enjoy a wide range of procedural advantages. Against Ghosn, who was facing potential sentences of more than a decade in prison, they had an even greater-than-usual asset: the full co-operation of Nissan, which had repeatedly made clear its determination to see him convicted and had provided a huge trove of documents as well as hands-on investigative assistance. Ghosn, a citizen of Brazil, France, and Lebanon, had sought diplomatic help from all three countries. Only the last had acted with evident enthusiasm, but its efforts weren’t getting anywhere.Ghosn, however, had another option — a desperate play, months in the planning, that might restore some portion of his freedom if everything went right, or send him straight back to a 7-square-meter (75-square-foot) cell in Tokyo’s central jail if any aspect went awry. In the Middle East, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and a veteran of the 2003 invasion of Iraq were preparing a daring plan to spirit Ghosn out of Tokyo, under the noses of Japanese police. They aimed to bring him back to Beirut — the city where he had spent most of his childhood, and the capital of a country where, thanks to his business success, Ghosn is considered something of a national hero.On its face, it must have seemed like a ridiculous idea. While the terms of Ghosn’s bail did not include a requirement to wear an ankle bracelet or other electronic tracker, his movements were closely monitored. Prosecutors had trained a camera on the door of his rented house, in Tokyo’s busy Roppongi neighbourhood, and as he moved through the Japanese capital he was shadowed by teams of plainclothes agents. Ghosn, who has bushy eyebrows, elongated ears and prominent sideburns, would have a memorable face even as a regular citizen, but two decades of corporate celebrity meant that he was perhaps the most recognizable foreigner in Japan. His chances of slipping undetected through Tokyo and onto an airplane would have seemed slim, to put it mildly.

Yet there was a clear window of opportunity. New Year’s is typically the longest holiday of the year in Japan, a time when government offices can close for more than a week and even the most hard-boiled prosecutors and police detectives take time off to be with their families. Moreover, Ghosn had good reason to believe he could evade at least some of the men monitoring his movements: his lawyers had recently threatened to file a complaint against a private security company hired by Nissan to follow him, claiming it was infringing illegally on his rights. According to a person familiar with the situation, the company’s agents had backed off as a result — at least temporarily. (Nissan declined to comment.) If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help.In the shadowy world of private-security contractors, Michael Taylor was a swashbuckler who stood out. He protected powerful people and companies, secretly helped the U.S. government investigate crimes, and admitted breaking the law himself. A veteran of the U.S. Army’s elite Special Forces — the famed Green Berets — Taylor in 1994 founded American International Security Corp., a Boston-area contractor that provided security for oil drilling operations and corporate executives, and rescued abducted children among other assignments. He was hired by The New York Times to mount a rescue of David Rohde, a correspondent who’d been kidnapped in 2008 in Afghanistan. (Rohde ultimately escaped on his own). He also worked as an undercover asset for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal bodies.Taylor’s career seemed to be prospering in 2007 when his firm secured a Pentagon contract, which eventually paid out US$54 million, to train Afghan special-forces troops. But in 2012, his fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. He was charged in Utah with an FBI agent over a plot to obstruct a fraud investigation of whether the Afghan contract was awarded improperly. Taylor ultimately pleaded guilty to two fraud charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. It wasn’t his first guilty plea. In 1997, he admitted two misdemeanour charges in Massachusetts related to a police report filed in a domestic case in which he’d been hired, his lawyers said.If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help 
 
Much of Taylor’s work over the years had, improbably enough, involved Lebanon. Taylor was born on Staten Island and graduated high school in Massachusetts, but over the years he developed deep ties to Ghosn’s home country. He was deployed to Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, beginning what his lawyers said was “a lifelong relationship with the Christian community in Lebanon” — the same community of which Ghosn is a prominent member. Fit, square-jawed and with silver hair, Taylor speaks Arabic, his wife Lamia is Lebanese, and two of their three sons attended college in Lebanon.For the Ghosn operation, Taylor had a partner, a Lebanese-born man named George-Antoine Zayek. Originally trained as a gemologist, his brother said by telephone, Zayek was also a member of a Christian militia when he met Taylor in the early 1980s, according to a person familiar with the matter, a time when Lebanon had fractured violently along sectarian lines. Zayek appears to have been associated with Taylor and his companies since the 1990s, based on public records in the U.S. According to his brother, however, Zayek left Lebanon at the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he began working for a private security company there. Taylor couldn’t be reached for comment and Zayek didn’t respond to multiple voicemail messages seeking comment.On the morning of Sunday, Dec. 29, Taylor and Zayek arrived in a Bombardier Global Express Jet — a plane with a range of more than 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) — at the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport, a busy hub built on an artificial island near Osaka. There were also two large black cases on board, according to people familiar with the flight who asked not to be identified.

Later the same day, according to security-camera footage reported on by Japanese media, Ghosn walked out the front door of his house, wearing a hat and a surgical-style face mask commonly used in Japan to protect against germs. He then took a bullet train from Tokyo’s Shinagawa station to Osaka at about 4:30 p.m. local time and, after the journey, took a cab to a hotel near the airport, the network NTV reported. That evening the same Bombardier jet took off from Kansai bound for Istanbul. According to a person familiar with the investigation of the flight, the team believed that flying straight to Beirut, a city that receives few if any arrivals from Osaka, would raise too many suspicions.Outbound passengers at the private terminal aren’t exempt from passport control, and according to people familiar with airport operations, there were customs and immigration officials present before the Bombardier’s departure. But Ghosn wasn’t boarding as an official passenger. He was, apparently, cargo, concealed in a large black case that, according to the people, was too big to fit into the airport’s X-ray machines. With nothing obviously amiss, by 11:10 p.m., the jet was in the air.Reaching Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport would take just over 12 hours. The team ferrying Ghosn appeared to have chosen its route carefully. From Osaka the plane headed north-northwest, avoiding South Korea — which has an extradition treaty with Japan — and then crossing into Russian airspace, where it remained for almost its entire journey. That wasn’t the most direct route, which would have taken the jet over China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. But it did keep Ghosn over a country where he has considerable connections, thanks to his work rescuing AvtoVAZ, a troubled Soviet-era automaker that’s now part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. If the Japanese government demanded his plane be stopped, he might have hoped for sympathy, or at least stalling, from Moscow.In fact, the Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country, and the Bombardier landed in Istanbul at around 5:30 a.m. local time on Dec. 30. Changing planes at Ataturk could expose Ghosn once again to detection. Just as at Kansai, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified discussing the details of the government’s subsequent investigation, Ghosn made the short trip inside a box. The second jet, a shorter-range Bombardier, took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country 
 
Safely on the ground in the country of his youth, Ghosn didn’t have to hide his identity. Although his lawyers had taken his travel documents as a condition of his bail, Ghosn had two French passports — a rare privilege, granted to citizens whose employment might require them to travel while also handing over a passport for visa applications. Ghosn had been able to keep the second one, under the condition that it remain in a plastic case secured by a combination lock for which only his lawyers had the code. According to a person familiar with it, the case wasn’t particularly sturdy, and with a hammer or drill and a bit of time it wouldn’t be difficult to crack open. His French passport in hand, Ghosn crossed into Lebanon legally.Carole, who had been counting the days since the couple had last been together (just short of nine months) was in Beirut to see her family for Christmas when Ghosn landed. She rushed to meet him and kept him largely to herself until the couple met up with a few friends for a New Year’s Eve dinner. A photo showed them at a table sharing wine and Champagne. They looked, if only for a moment, like a normal couple with normal concerns.Even Ghosn’s closest advisers were blindsided when news of his escape began to break on Dec. 31. His Japanese lawyers said they had no idea what he had planned; in an impromptu press conference outside his office, lead counsel Junichiro Hironaka seemed genuinely bewildered by what had just occurred, describing himself as “dumbfounded.” Ghosn’s U.S. representatives at Paul Weiss, the white-shoe New York law firm, had been kept similarly in the dark. So was Greg Kelly, the former Nissan executive who’d been taken into custody at the same time and remains in Tokyo, forbidden to leave the country before trial. (He denies wrongdoing). With no details forthcoming on how Ghosn managed to sneak out of Japan, media outlets around the world began speculating on a range of outlandish theories — the most widely circulated that he had left his house disguised as a very large musical instrument after hosting a troupe of Lebanese musicians for a holiday concert.

Ghosn’s public-relations apparatus, which includes top-drawer firms in New York and Paris, let most of the speculation go uncommented upon. That changed dramatically as reports began to appear suggesting that Carole Ghosn or other members of his family had helped plan his escape — which, if accurate, might expose them to criminal charges in Japan or elsewhere. On Jan. 2, Ghosn said in a statement that, somewhat improbably given the constant surveillance of his communications, “I alone arranged for my departure.” His family, he said, “had no role whatsoever.”Even if that’s true, Ghosn had plenty of help from individuals who may now be at risk of serious legal repercussions. In Turkey, the authorities quickly detained seven people connected with the flights, including four pilots, and remanded most of them into custody. MNG Jet Havacilik AS, the company from which the aircraft were leased, also filed a criminal complaint and said an employee falsified records in order to hide the fact that they were ferrying a fugitive. Japan’s justice minister, meanwhile, announced the opening of an investigation into Ghosn’s escape, raising the prospect of charges for anyone who aided him. Nor is Ghosn entirely in the clear. While Lebanon is a nation that refuses, as a matter of policy, to extradite its citizens for trial abroad, he’s probably stuck there indefinitely. Japan has requested that Interpol issue a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn’s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive. His life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over.(Ghosn's) life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over 
 
A long-term life on the run isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. Roman Polanski, the Rosemary’s Baby director who fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid being imprisoned in an underage sex case, has lived openly in Europe ever since — protected by France’s similar policy against extraditing — and he remains a celebrated if controversial filmmaker. But such an existence wouldn’t deliver what Ghosn seems to crave most: legal vindication. His lawyers intend to propose that he be tried on the Japanese allegations in Lebanon, with Tokyo prosecutors providing investigative files to allow their Beirut counterparts to bring the case, according to Ghosn’s Beirut attorney, Carlos Abou Jaoude. Such an arrangement would be all but unprecedented, and, for the Japanese government, deeply embarrassing: agreeing to it would amount to an admission that it won’t be able to get him back. Japanese prosecutors, meanwhile, would be certain to view a Lebanese trial as biased in favour of the defendant. Ghosn is one of Lebanon’s most celebrated citizens — his face is even on a postage stamp — and it’s hard to imagine a friendlier locale for a hearing.

Ghosn was awaiting trial in Japan on four charges — two for allegedly understating his compensation in regulatory filings, and two more “breach of trust” allegations, in which prosecutors claim he used Nissan’s resources for his own gain. From the beginning of his legal drama he’s denied wrongdoing and claimed that the allegations against him are the result of a political vendetta — an illegitimate attempt to settle scores and stop him from integrating Nissan more closely with Renault — that should never have put him in a courtroom, let alone a jail cell. According to people familiar with his intentions, he plans to use his freedom to assail the Japanese legal system and to do everything he can to publicly discredit the charges. His first salvo will come at a press conference he plans to hold in Beirut on Wednesday.Throughout his career, Ghosn portrayed himself as a singular figure, the driving force behind the creation of one of the world’s largest automotive groups and the only person capable of keeping it together. In recent years he was clearly in legacy mode, preparing the groundwork for a deal that would finally bring Nissan and Renault together under a single corporate umbrella. Had his plans to incorporate rival Fiat-Chrysler into the alliance come to fruition, he might have created the world’s largest carmaker and reasonably expected to be remembered as a business visionary, one of the few individuals — like Lee Iacocca, Jack Welch or Gordon Moore — whose careers helped reshape their industries. For the foreseeable future, however, he will be known above all as something very different: a fugitive.Bloomberg.com"

Chairman Richard Baker raised his offer to take the struggling retailer private, handing a victory to minority shareholders including Catalyst Capital Group Inc. that fought to derail the original bid.Hudson’s Bay said in a statement late Friday it agreed to a new bid by Baker and a group of allies, who together control the company. The offer was increased for a second time to $11 a share from $10.30. Baker’s first offer was for $9.45 apiece in June.The retailer’s shares were trading up more than 9 per cent at $10.80 on Monday morning. The new take-private bid values the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue at about $2 billion. Catalyst, a Toronto-based private equity firm that had waged a campaign against the agreement and convinced the regulator to delay the vote, agreed to support the new deal.

The raised offer “delivers significantly more value for all minority shareholders, well above the original proposal,” said Gabriel de Alba, managing director and partner of Catalyst, in a separate statement.This “provides minority shareholders with compelling and immediate value and is supported by our largest minority shareholder,” said David Leith, the chairman of the board’s special committee formed last year to weigh in on the offer.Catalyst, which owns a 17.5 per cent stake in the retailer, was a substantial hurdle for the controlling shareholders to overcome. The firm’s stake amounts to about 32 per cent of the minority shareholder votes, and while Baker now has its support, the deal isn’t done.The private equity firm still has the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including if the amended circular for the planned February vote hasn’t been filed with regulators and mailed to shareholders by Feb. 14 or if it is substantially different than what has been communicated to Catalyst. The acquisition consortium also has to include fairness opinions from financial advisers of the special committees, and an updated circular that includes a formal valuation where the lower end of the range is equal to or less than $11 a share.Baker has said he wants to let the Canadian retailer attempt a turnaround outside the glare of public markets. While it has reduced debt after selling assets in Europe, the company is still struggling to boost sales at its eponymous chain in Canada, the oldest company in North America. Saks has also recently showed signs of weakening. The luxury retailer last month posted its first same-store sales decline in at least eight quarters.The sweetened offer may further boost shares, which gained more than 20 per cent this week after reports that Baker had approached minority shareholders about potentially raising the offer.While the $10.30-a-share offer was approved by the board in October, preliminary tallies showed the Baker group had fallen short of the necessary support from investors to proceed with the transaction, according to people familiar with the matter.Catalyst, which is run by Newton Glassman, had made its own proposal at $11 a share that was rejected by a special committee of the board because Baker’s group was adamant it wouldn’t tender its shares. Bloomberg.com"

That’s “consistent with our previous research, which shows that being long gold is a better hedge to such geopolitical risks.”Spot gold climbed as much as 2.3 per cent to US$1,588.13 an ounce on Monday, the highest level since April 2013, and traded at US$1,576.67 at 7:54 a.m. in New York.Prices could reach US$1,600 if tensions escalate further, according to UBS Group AG and ABN Amro Bank NV.Overbought TerritoryThe recent rally brought the metal to its most overbought level in two decades, with spot gold’s relative strength index at 87 on Monday.While further escalation could trigger more upside in prices, the rally risks running out of steam as liquidity returns to the market after the New Year break, said ABN Amro strategist Georgette Boele.“Investors came back from holidays and experienced a $100 higher gold price compared to when they left,” she said. “Some have bought it in a kind of panic way, while others who already hold gold will probably wait and see.”Buying SpreeBullion is building on the largest annual climb since 2010, which was driven by the U.S.-China trade war’s drag on global growth, easier monetary policy across the world’s leading economies and sustained buying from exchange-traded funds and central banks.“Negative real rates in the U.S. and a weaker U.S. dollar favour stronger precious metal prices in general,” said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Wealth Management. “Thus, we see value in staying long the metal.”The Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates within the next six months, which will in turn probably keep a cap on the U.S. dollar — both of which are “extremely positive” for gold, said Gavin Wendt, senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty in Sydney.Most PreciousPalladium has also benefited from the optimism surrounding havens, as well as its own positive fundamentals. The metal is in a multiyear deficit as demand rises in autocatalysts amid stricter emissions standards.Spot palladium hit a record US$2,030.28 an ounce.“Palladium, like gold, has been steadily tracking higher over the last two weeks, and the conflict between the U.S. and Tehran seems to have bolstered this,” said Sean MacLean, research strategist at Pepperstone Ltd. “Demand for palladium is increasing faster than its supply, so the long-term trend is on the up anyway.”Other moversSilver and platinum also rose, with spot silver advancing to as much as US$18.5081 an ounce, the highest since Sept. 25. Gold miners extended gains. Newcrest Mining Ltd. rose 3.9 per cent in Sydney, while AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. added as much as 2.2 per cent in Johannesburg.Bloomberg.com"

Chairman Richard Baker raised his offer to take the struggling retailer private, handing a victory to minority shareholders including Catalyst Capital Group Inc. that fought to derail the original bid.Hudson’s Bay said in a statement late Friday it agreed to a new bid by Baker and a group of allies, who together control the company. The offer was increased for a second time to C$11 ($8.46) a share from C$10.30. Baker’s first offer was for C$9.45 apiece in June.The new take-private bid values the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue at about C$2 billion. Catalyst, a Toronto-based private equity firm that had waged a campaign against the agreement and convinced the regulator to delay the vote, agreed to support the new deal.The raised offer 'delivers significantly more value for all minority shareholders, well above the original proposal' 
 
The raised offer “delivers significantly more value for all minority shareholders, well above the original proposal,” said Gabriel de Alba, managing director and partner of Catalyst, in a separate statement.This “provides minority shareholders with compelling and immediate value and is supported by our largest minority shareholder,” said David Leith, the chairman of the board’s special committee formed last year to weigh in on the offer.Catalyst, which owns a 17.5 per cent stake in the retailer, was a substantial hurdle for the controlling shareholders to overcome. The firm’s stake amounts to about 32 per cent of the minority shareholder votes, and while Baker now has its support, the deal isn’t done.The private equity firm still has the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including if the amended circular for the planned February vote hasn’t been filed with regulators and mailed to shareholders by Feb. 14 or if it is substantially different than what has been communicated to Catalyst. The acquisition consortium also has to include fairness opinions from financial advisers of the special committees, and an updated circular that includes a formal valuation where the lower end of the range is equal to or less than C$11 a share.

Baker has said he wants to let the Canadian retailer attempt a turnaround outside the glare of public markets. While it has reduced debt after selling assets in Europe, the company is still struggling to boost sales at its eponymous chain in Canada, the oldest company in North America. Saks has also recently showed signs of weakening. The luxury retailer last month posted its first same-store sales decline in at least eight quarters.The sweetened offer may further boost shares, which gained more than 20 per cent this week after reports that Baker had approached minority shareholders about potentially raising the offer.While the C$10.30-a-share offer was approved by the board in October, preliminary tallies showed the Baker group had fallen short of the necessary support from investors to proceed with the transaction, according to people familiar with the matter.Catalyst, which is run by Newton Glassman, had made its own proposal at C$11 a share that was rejected by a special committee of the board because Baker’s group was adamant it wouldn’t tender its shares."

Rising tensions between the Iran and the U.S. have already caused unprecedented disruptions to oil markets, but so far they’ve been short-lived. Last year, Washington blamed Tehran for sabotage attacks on supertankers and a missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq crude-processing plant in September — the largest single supply halt in the industry’s history.An escalation into direct fighting between U.S. and Iranian forces in the world’s most important oil-producing region would have longer lasting consequences for the global economy.Severe RetaliationIran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif denounced the attack on Twitter as “an act of international terrorism.” The country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened “severe retaliation.”The Iranian leadership is signalling that it will probably target U.S. military installations and bases in the Middle East and mobilize its network of militias across the region. One official told the state broadcaster that some 36 U.S. military bases and facilities are within reach of Iran’s defence forces, with the closest being in Bahrain.The U.S. State Department issued a directive urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately due to the threat.Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping 4.65 million barrels a day last month. It’s immediate neighbours in the region — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran — together produce about 15 million barrels a day. Most of their exports leave the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that Iran has repeatedly threatened to shut down if there’s a war.Emergency MeetingsBeyond the initial 4.8 per cent surge in New York crude futures to an eight-month high, there were other signals in the market that people were preparing for further disruption.Volatility rose to its highest level in a month and the cost of derivatives that insure against price spikes increased. Four million barrels of options contracts that would profit from a jump in Brent crude to US$95 a barrel traded for both March and September.Two commodity-trading houses called emergency meetings of senior staff on Friday to assess the new risks to the oil market, said people familiar with the matter.Possible retaliation could include targeted strikes on oil facilities in the area, attacks on pipelines or oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Ed Morse said in a report.“We expect retaliation to be in the region, most likely in Iraq,” analysts at ESAI Energy LLC said in a report. “This could have significant impact on crude oil prices.”Vulnerable TargetsIraq’s oil fields are working normally, the country’s Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban told Bloomberg by phone on Friday. Four U.S. citizens working at an Exxon Mobil Corp.-operated project have been asked to leave, he said.“We are closely monitoring the situation in Iraq,” ExxonMobil said in an emailed statement. The company declined to comment on specific staffing levels, but said it has “programs and measures in place to provide security to protect its people, operations and facilities.”Italy’s Eni SpA, which operates Iraq’s Zubair field, also said it’s monitoring the situation, while BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc declined to comment.International companies have reason to be cautious as Iranian proxies have repeatedly proved their ability to strike targets within Iraq. The latest escalation in tensions came after a rocket attack on a military base late last month, which killed an American contractor and wounded several U.S. and Iraqi military personnel.“The Soleimani hit moves us closer to a full-blown war scenario than Abqaiq,” Bobb McNally, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush and president of the consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said on Twitter. Still, “both DC and Tehran want to avoid war and will try to contain brinkmanship,” he said.Bloomberg.com"

But his net worth also more than doubled during the period, a result of soaring stock markets and favourable tax policies.And so, at the end of the decade, the world’s second-richest person said he wants his fellow billionaires to pay much higher taxes. 
This is the simple strategy fuelling the rise of Bill Gates’ fortune

U.S. lawmakers should close loopholes, raise the estate tax and hike the capital-gains tax so that it equals the rate on labour income, Gates wrote Monday in a year-end blog post. He also called for states and local governments to make their taxes “fairer” and reiterated his support for a state income tax in Washington, where he and his wife Melinda live.“I’ve been disproportionately rewarded for the work I’ve done — while many others who work just as hard struggle to get by,” he wrote. “That’s why I’m for a tax system in which, if you have more money, you pay a higher percentage in taxes. And I think the rich should pay more than they currently do, and that includes Melinda and me.”Gates, 64, has a net worth of US$113.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. In 2010, he and Melinda announced the Giving Pledge with Warren Buffett and asked other billionaires to sign to give away portions of their fortunes. As of May, 204 people from 23 countries agreed to participate.At an event in November, Gates expressed reservations about the wealth tax proposed by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. In his blog post, he said he won’t take a position on the various proposals being debated during the campaign.“But I believe we can make our system fairer without sacrificing the incentive to innovate,” he wrote. “Americans in the top 1 per cent can afford to pay a lot more before they stop going to work or creating jobs. In the 1970s, when Paul Allen and I were starting Microsoft, marginal tax rates were almost twice the top rate today. It didn’t hurt our incentive to build a great company.”Some people ask Gates why he doesn’t just pay extra taxes himself, but that “is not a scalable solution,” he wrote. “Additional voluntary giving will never raise enough money for everything the government needs to do.”The Gates foundation had paid out US$50.1 billion in grants as of the end of 2018. Gates defended tax breaks for foundations in his post, writing that “philanthropy is good at managing high-risk projects that government can’t take on and corporations won’t.”Bloomberg.com"

Ghosn said in his statement from Lebanon on Tuesday that he would “finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Lebanese authorities themselves pressed Japan to return Ghosn just a week before he fled the country, the Financial Times said. According to Reuters, a private security firm oversaw the escape and Ghosn met Lebanese President Michel Aoun after arriving in Beirut. Aoun’s office has denied the encounter took place.

Either way, get ready for what’s likely to be a blistering public relations assault that will rattle some cages in both Japan and France. Ghosn is planning a press conference on Jan. 8 in Beirut, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Based on past statements by Ghosn and his wife Carole, here’s a guide to what may be in store.Japan’s Legal System“I have not fled justice,” Ghosn said in the first emailed statement after his remarkable exit from Japan. “I have escaped injustice and political persecution.” An even more robust indictment of the nation’s legal system is likely in the weeks ahead.

Ghosn’s arrest revived long-standing concerns about the fairness of Japan’s judicial system, where prosecutors can grill suspects repeatedly without their lawyers present and enjoy an almost 100 per cent conviction rate.Under the terms of the executive’s bail, the courts restricted contact with his family. In his Dec. 31 statement, Ghosn called the Japanese justice system rigged and said his “basic human rights” had been denied, including the presumption of innocence. Those are issues that he almost certainly would have put on the world stage had his case come to trial.Unholy TrinityFor months, Ghosn’s attorneys have been arguing that all of the charges against their client were bogus, the result of a broad conspiracy among nationalistic Nissan officials, Japanese prosecutors and the government itself.The goal, according to Ghosn, was to smear him in order to prevent the executive from further integrating Nissan and France’s Renault, a plan that threatened the Japanese carmaker’s autonomy and was vehemently opposed in the highest echelons of Tokyo officialdom.Corporate AssassinsIn April, Ghosn was detained before a scheduled tell-all press conference, prompting his camp to release a pre-recorded video for such an eventuality.In it, Ghosn spoke of several Nissan executives whom he claimed turned on him to advance their own interests. The original video named the people; that segment was edited out in the version released to the public.“I’m talking here about a few executives who, obviously for their own interests and for their own selfish fears, are creating a lot of value destruction. Names? You know them,” Ghosn hinted in his video. Now, Ghosn may really be ready to disclose names.Nissan’s SlideIn his video, Ghosn also criticized Nissan’s management for the company’s poor performance, saying they lost sight of the need to move the alliance with Renault forward.“I’m worried because obviously the performance of Nissan is declining, but also I’m worried because I don’t think there is any vision for the alliance being built,” Ghosn said in the video.Nissan’s earnings have tumbled to the lowest level in a decade and the stock was the worst performer on the Bloomberg World Auto Manufacturers Index last year (the second-worst was Renault), so he may hit that note again.French EstablishmentIn several interviews, Ghosn’s wife, Carole, lashed out at the French establishment for not doing more to help the former head of Renault, who also is a French citizen.In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, she said President Emmanuel Macron hasn’t answered her pleas for help. “The silence from the Elysee Palace is deafening,” she said. “I thought France was a country that defended the presumption of innocence. They’ve all forgotten everything Carlos did for France’s economy and for Renault.”It remains to be seen which talking points Ghosn will hit the hardest. Yet this much is clear: He is a fighter, and he has everything to lose if he can’t pull ahead in the PR war. That suggests his approach won’t be subtle.Bloomberg.com"

In one speculative account, which cited no sources, Lebanese television station MTV reported that Ghosn smuggled himself out in a large musical instrument box after a Christmas band visited his residence in Tokyo. He was then shipped out of the country and later entered Lebanon from Turkey on a private plane.A detailed report in French daily Le Monde, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn’s wife Carole organized the escape with the help of her brothers and their contacts in Turkey. After leaving Tokyo, Ghosn took a private jet from a small airport in Japan to Turkey, and from there entered Lebanon with an ID card, landing in Beirut with Carole. The decision to flee may have come because of new information Japanese authorities could have obtained from a Swiss bank and from offshore centres including Dubai, the newspaper reported.The Lebanese newspaper Annahar, by contrast, reported that Ghosn entered the country with a French passport. The former industry heavyweight has Lebanese, French and Brazilian citizenship — though all his passports had been taken from him. Meanwhile, a report that Ghosn met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun was denied by an official at the presidency.French newspaper Les Echos said Ghosn may have left Japan under a false identity with a forged passport, boarding a private plane from a smaller airport, where he would be less likely to be recognized.The French foreign ministry, for its part, said it doesn’t know how Ghosn made his escape.

Chairman Richard Baker and his partners have approached minority shareholders, including Catalyst Capital Group, about potentially raising their offer to take the Canadian retailer private, according to people familiar with the matter.Baker and a group of allies have floated the idea of raising their offer to around $11 a share from $10.30 a share, roughly the same price Catalyst Capital offered for the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue in November, said the people who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The Baker group collectively own a 57 per cent stake in Hudson’s Bay, but likely needs a majority of minority shareholders for a deal to go through.There are no substantive conversations ongoing between Catalyst and the Baker group at this time, the people said. Catalyst remains concerned about the Baker group’s ability to proceed with a transaction after several issues were raised by the Ontario Securities Commission last month about its bid, one of the people said.

Representatives for Catalyst and the Baker group declined to comment. Hudson’s Bay didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Catalyst, which owns a 17.5 per cent stake in the retailer, remains a substantial hurdle for the controlling shareholders to overcome. The Toronto-based firm’s stake amounts to about 32 per cent of the minority shareholder votes.Preliminary tallies earlier this month showed that the Baker group’s earlier $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) bid for the company had fallen short of the necessary support from investors to proceed before the vote was delayed by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.Shares in Hudson’s Bay rose as much as 24 per cent on Tuesday. An earlier report from Women’s Wear Daily said the parties could reach a deal within 48 hours. The stock was up 15 per cent to $9.40 as of 10:28 a.m. in Toronto, giving the company a market value of about $1.73 billion.Investor OppositionMinority investors including Catalyst have opposed the Baker bid, saying it undervalues the company’s real estate and that it didn’t provide enough disclosure to shareholders. The Ontario Securities Commission endorsed a complaint by Catalyst and ordered a delay in the shareholder vote while seeking increased disclosure on the Baker bid.Catalyst, which is run by Newton Glassman, had made its own proposal that was rejected by a special committee of the board because Baker’s group was adamant it wouldn’t tender its shares.Bloomberg.com"

While risk-sensitive currencies like the loonie should perform well if the global economy continues to firm, Shahab Jalinoos believes Bank of Canada policy makers will be quick to try to curtail a significant rise.“The key risk is the BOC itself, which tends to talk more dovishly whenever CAD shows material strength,” Jalinoos said, using the market abbreviation for the Canadian currency. Additionally, the Bank of Canada’s search for a new chief may “create some uncertainty that hinders CAD appreciation,” he said. The central bank has formally started its hunt for a successor to Stephen Poloz, who is stepping down as governor in June.

The Canadian dollar is on pace to be the best-performing major currency in 2019, notching an almost 5 per cent gain against the greenback in a year that saw foreign-exchange volatility sink to record lows. Resurgent commodity prices helped buoy the currency, as did a central bank that kept borrowing costs steady, making it an outlier in the global easing trend.For those reasons, Jalinoos sees the dollar-loonie rate consolidating around US$1.28 per dollar. The pair fell for a fifth straight day to drop below US$1.30 for the first time in over a year on Tuesday, the lowest level since October 2018.One technical indicator pains a brighter picture for loonie bulls. The pair trade is on track for a monthly close well below its long-run trend support at US$1.3155, which would provide a clear signal that there’s more U.S. dollar weakness in the offing. While charting patterns suggest firm support for the greenback in the low-to-mid $1.30 range — a level breached on Tuesday — there may be little in the way of longer run supports until the $1.28 zone.Still, Bannockburn Global Forex sees the Canadian dollar’s run largely stalling out, with a 2020 year-end forecast of $1.295. While the nation’s economic growth was resilient to a global slowdown in 2019, the data is poised to soften, according to the firm’s chief market strategist Marc Chandler. That should prompt the central bank to cut interest rates twice, a view reinforced by policy makers’ recent “shift from neutrality,” he said.Domestic data since the Bank of Canada’s last rate decision of the year has been weak, with gross domestic product shrinking for the first time in eight months and the nation suffering its biggest jobs loss since 2009.“The Canadian economy is weakening and the central bank will have to cut rates,” Chandler wrote in an email. “Typically, in a weakening USD environment, CAD lags on crosses.”Bloomberg.com"
