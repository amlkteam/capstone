The fund is managed by chief investment officer Francois Bourdon and two others.The fund invests in the residential and commercial construction sector through limited partnerships (LPs) with various partners that specialize in lending solutions. The fund also puts money into partnerships that offer private loans to companies and other types of loans.Nearly 64% of the fund\u2019s loans are for housing projects, as of the end of February; 91% are in Canada or the U.S.\u201cThe Diversified Lending strategy has been progressively positioned for a cycle that was getting longer in the tooth, but not for a recession,\u201d the company said in a fund document on its website. \u201cThe social distancing measures will have a negative impact on certain borrowers in the strategy; interest payments may be postponed and depending on the length of the measures, more workouts than expected may occur.\u201dThe fund was created in 2008 and has generated net annualized returns of 6.55% since inception, according to the company\u2019s website. This year the fund was up 1.69% in the first quarter.The firm is telling clients the fund is well-diversified and could use its liquidity sources to satisfy investors in a fair manner, said one person who spoke on condition they not be named.A Fiera Capital spokesperson declined to comment.Montreal-based Fiera, which has 750 employees in North America and Europe, managed C$170 billion at the end of 2019. Its largest revenue line comes from handling institutional money. About 45% of its assets under management are in fixed income.\u2018Pandemic Effects\u2019The coronavirus pandemic is buffeting Canada\u2019s alternative lenders. Last month, Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors that it had gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201d The non-bank lender has C$1.6 billion in assets under management. Most of its direct lending funds are invested in collateral-based bridge loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Canadian non-bank commercial mortgage lenders also froze redemptions as the underlying assets couldn\u2019t be sold fast enough to keep pace with sustained withdrawals, Bloomberg reported in March.Vancouver-based Trez Capital gated approximately C$2.6 billion. It didn\u2019t say how long the freeze would last to \u201cavoid building unrealistic expectations\u201d.Some firms such as Morrison Laurier Mortgage Corp. have gone further and also suspended dividends and new purchases last month, according to sources.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Maloney and John Gittelsohn", "title": "Elon Musk puts two homes up for sale after vow to sell most possessions", "description": "He's seeking a combined US$39.5 million for the Bel Air properties, including one that was previously owned by the late Gene Wilder", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/elon-musk-puts-two-homes-up-for-sale-after-vow-to-sell-most-possessions", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/elon-musk-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020 1:59 PM EDT", "content": "Tesla Inc.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "'Never seen anything as catastrophic': Malls in Canada face massive hit as unpaid rent surges", "description": "In the country's enclosed regional malls \u2014 a category that includes Toronto's Eaton Centre \u2014 only 20 per cent to 25 per cent of tenants paid rent in April", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/malls-face-catastrophic-hit-in-canada-with-unpaid-rent-surging?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/eaton-centre.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 7:04 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s malls are facing a wave of skipped rents and could see vacancy rates triple by year-end, with the coronavirus poised to leave its scars on a fragile retail sector long after the pandemic ends.In the country\u2019s enclosed regional malls \u2014 a category that includes Toronto\u2019s Eaton Centre and Pacific Centre in Vancouver \u2014 only 20 per cent to 25 per cent of tenants paid rent in April, according to brokerage firm JLL Canada.

Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That\u2019s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year \u2014 a level Sanderson describes as \u201cvery tight.\u201d\u201cMany retailers are in trouble,\u201d Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. \u201cI think when we get to the other side of this, there\u2019s a real reckoning to be had.\u201dI think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadRoelof van Dijk \n \nMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson", "title": "Once seen as safer than gold, Canadian real estate braces for the 'Great Reckoning'", "description": "The real estate industry is now in a state of paralysis with households among the world's most indebted, poorly placed to weather the storm", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-real-estate-great-reckoning-covid-19?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 16, 2020 1:10 PM EDT", "content": "Canadian housing once seemed so infallible that the head of the world\u2019s biggest asset manager in 2015 described Vancouver condos as a better store of wealth than gold.The coronavirus is putting that theory to the test.While lockdowns, job losses and uncertainty are roiling property markets from the U.K. to Australia to Hong Kong, Canada\u2019s situation is more precarious than most.

Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada set for bigger buying spree \u2014 here\u2019s where the billions might go", "description": "Next up may be provincial debt which is showing signs of credit strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-set-for-bigger-buying-spree-decision-day-guide", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stephen-poloz-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 15, 2020 6:00 AM EDT", "content": "As Stephen Poloz goes into his penultimate policy meeting as Bank of Canada governor on Wednesday, economists are trying to gauge how much of a buying mood he\u2019s in.With the country suffering one of its sharpest downturns since the Great Depression, Poloz is widely expected to dig deeper into his unconventional toolkit, whether that\u2019s at the April 15 meeting or later. The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt. \n\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years\nWhy Trudeau should put aside his personal agenda and ask Bank of Canada's Poloz to delay retirement\nCanada is at a critical juncture \u2014 if we don\u2019t transform our economy then we will face a greater crisis\nOne thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?Expanding PurchasesThe central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Provide ClarityAustralia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "One of Canada's largest private lenders halts redemptions", "description": "Bridging Finance said in an letter to investors Monday that it has gated its funds indefinitely 'to maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/one-of-canadas-largest-private-lenders-halts-redemptions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/money-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 2:26 PM EDT", "content": "One of Canada\u2019s largest private lenders is freezing redemptions.Bridging Finance Inc. said in an letter to investors Monday that it has gated its funds indefinitely \u201cto maintain investor value and limit pandemic effects.\u201dThe non-bank lender has $1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) in assets under management with the most of its direct lending funds invested in collateral-based bridging loans, inventory and accounts-receivables financing.Request for redemptions spiked to about 15 per cent of the assets from the usual 5 per cent, which prompted the gating, Chief Executive Officer David Sharpe said by phone.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest.

Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth. People like Michael Baum, who did manage to buy, fear they made their purchases at the exact wrong moment.Just two weeks ago, Baum, a 33-year-old special needs teacher, moved into a new house purchased using money from his wedding and family savings in Plano, Illinois. While he still has work, his wife recently lost her customer service job in retail. They not only have a mortgage, but her student loans to pay off still.\u201cIt could be a problem if the unemployment stops,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reed Stevenson", "title": "Michael Burry of 'The Big Short'\u00a0slams coronavirus lockdowns in tweetstorm", "description": "Burry says lockdowns intended to contain the pandemic are worse than the disease itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-slams-virus-lockdowns-in-tweetstorm", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michael-burry.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 7, 2020 2:43 PM EDT", "content": "Michael Burry, the doctor-turned-investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, has taken to Twitter with a controversial message: lockdowns intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic are worse than the disease itself.Government-directed shutdowns in the U.S., which led to millions of job losses and may trigger one of the country\u2019s\u00a0 deepest-ever economic contractions, aren\u2019t necessary to contain the epidemic and have disproportionately hurt low-income families and minorities, Burry argued in a series of tweets over the past two weeks. He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dinesh Nair, Archana Narayanan and Matthew Burgess", "title": "Brookfield, Global Infrastructure Partners in talks to team up for ADNOC gas pipelines", "description": "Stake could be valued at about US$15 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/gip-brookfield-in-talks-to-team-up-for-adnoc-gas-pipelines", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/adnoc.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 6, 2020 1:41 PM EDT", "content": "Global Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. are among investors in talks to jointly bid for a stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.\u2019s natural gas pipelines, which could be valued at about US$15 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.Italian infrastructure operator Snam SpA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Singapore sovereign fund GIC Pte and a Korean firm are in discussions to join the same consortium, which has been pursuing as much as a 49 per cent stake in the assets, the people said.The group is the only remaining bidder for the stake \u2014 which could rank as one of this year\u2019s largest infrastructure deals globally \u2014 after other parties including Australian fund manager IFM Investors Pty dropped out, the people said.

One more pillar of the Canadian economy is under threat from the coronavirus pandemic.What was a roaring start to the spring house-hunting season has ended in a whimper. By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201d \nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nOpen houses going extinct as Canadian housing market grapples with coronavirus fallout\nMortgage rates on the rise again as coronavirus and oil shock weigh on lenders\u2019 minds\nReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt \n \nHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dRebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Mortgage rates are rising in Canada even as central bank cuts", "description": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/mortgage-rates-rising-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:01 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s mortgage rates are creeping up \u2014 even though the country\u2019s central bank has slashed borrowing costs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.That\u2019s due to the \u201cenormous pressure\u201d Canadian banks face amid disruptions caused by the outbreak, said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centers.\u201cThe costs of funds for banks is skyrocketing and bank earnings are plunging,\u201d Cooper said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cEvery single business they have ever loaned to is subject to a massive decline in revenues, and therefore their own revenues are going down because nobody is taking out new business with banks except to extend debt.\u201dThe Bank of Canada has cut its overnight interest rate three times this month, bringing the benchmark to 0.25 per cent.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers. \nOttawa asks banks, credit-card companies to lower interest rates\n\u2018We will overcome this:\u2019 G20 leaders vow to strengthen global financial safety net\nJack M. Mintz: Canada needs to think BIG now to avoid a long, deep recession\n\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's big banks have already fielded 213,000 requests for mortgage deferrals", "description": "Banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadas-big-banks-field-213000-requests-for-mortgage-deferrals?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/banks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 10:28 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s biggest banks have fielded hundreds of thousands of requests from homeowners seeking to hold off making mortgage payments under a new coronavirus-related relief plan.More than 213,000 requests to defer payments have been completed or are being processed since the country\u2019s six largest banks announced the plan last week, Mathieu Labreche, a spokesman for the Canadian Bankers Association, said Thursday in an interview.\u201cThe large number of customers that have been helped continues to grow as the result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, contact-centre agents and operations teams working diligently,\u201d he said. \nManulife to offer mortgage, credit card relief to those affected by COVID-19\nConsumer watchdog keeping close eye on banks\u2019 offer of coronavirus mortgage relief\nBig banks to allow delayed mortgage payments to some in unprecedented response to coronavirus crisis\nRoyal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced.

This is a massive liquidity program.\u201dBeyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed\u2019s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.\u201cThis is a great step forward,\u201d said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cGetting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.\u201dOther HighlightsTwo more programs were created to support large employers \u2014 a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility for new bond and loan issuance, and a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. Yet another program, a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, will \u201cenable the issuance of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and certain other assets. The central bank also said it would expand the existing Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable-rate demand notes Finally, the Fed said it would expand the existing Commercial Paper Funding Facility to also include high-quality municipal debt, another move to help cash-strapped states and cities. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s latest moves signal a resounding \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 approach from the central bank, and dispel any notion that monetary policy makers are either sparing ammunition or running out of unconventional tools,\u201d Andrew Husby and Carl Riccadonna, of Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note to clients.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis and Paula Sambo", "title": "Canada beefs up liquidity plan with pledge to buy up to $50 billion in uninsured mortgages", "description": "Changes will allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canada-beefs-up-liquidity-plan-with-expanded-mortgage-guarantee", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/sold.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 20, 2020 2:14 PM EDT", "content": "The Canadian government announced it will guarantee previously uninsured mortgages, allowing it to acquire these loans in a $50 billion (US$34.8 billion) state purchase program.The step is aimed at making it easier for smaller institutions \u2014 which may not have enough insured loans \u2014 to participate in the liquidity boosting plan, analysts said.\u201cThese are extraordinary times and we are taking extraordinary measures,\u201d Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this measure, banks and lenders will have more liquidity \u2014 which, in turn, will enable them to work on a case by case basis with Canadian businesses and individuals who face hardship at this time.\u201d \nAlmost 33% of Canadian households rent their homes.

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn\u2019t a Goldman Sachs problem. Wall Street\u2019s nonstop aggressiveness is clashing with the demands of a deadly pandemic. As government officials, doctors and companies tell people around the world to stay home, interviews with bankers and traders inside the industry\u2019s giants show many feel torn between public health and private profit. \n\u2018I can only survive for a month\u2019: Gig economy workers hit first \u2014 and hardest \u2014 by COVID-19 crisis\nCoronavirus relief package likely not enough to stop widespread layoffs, some observers warn\nHow much damage can the coronavirus do to Canada\u2019s economy \u2014 and how we\u2019ll bounce back: BMO chief economist Doug Porter \u2014 podcast\n\u201cPeople do come in when they have a cold,\u201d said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. \u201cSometimes you have that old boss where you\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.\u201dWall Street\u2019s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren\u2019t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he\u2019s facing pressure to be \u201ca tough guy\u201d who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there\u2019s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there\u2019s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank\u2019s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren\u2019t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. \u201cIf you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. \u201cTake sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.\u201dThe culture that\u2019s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry\u2019s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country\u2019s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.\n\nA pedestrian walks past a JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank branch in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg files\n\nFrom their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan\u2019s home-lending group were told they couldn\u2019t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible to bring equipment home yet.\u201cWe have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,\u201d a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. \u201cThe remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.\u201dInside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.\u2019s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.\u201cThere are managers who will say, \u2018We\u2019re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,\u2019\u201d said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. \u201cAnd then there are others who will say, \u2018We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.\u2019\u201dThe tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Paul Sorbera \n \nSome London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank\u2019s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it\u2019s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kait Bolongaro and Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Trudeau unveils financial aid worth $82 billion to help Canadians weather coronavirus", "description": "This includes $27 billion in direct support for individuals and companies and $55 billion in tax deferrals for both households and businesses", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-expects-to-unveil-fiscal-stimulus-package-on-wednesday?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trudeau-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 17, 2020 1:57 PM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced plans to roll out a fiscal package worth 3% of Canada\u2019s economy as it grapples with fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The measures will be worth a combined $82 billion (US$56.7 billion), Trudeau said Wednesday in Ottawa.

Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.Global Easing in 2020\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move \u2014 alone \u2014 failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they\u2019re really inventing new stuff,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.\u201cThis is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is. They\u2019re going to have to step it up a lot more.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales, prices surge as buyers stampede back into the market", "description": "Benchmark price for home climbs to $846,100 and realtors see it hitting $900,000 this year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-prices-roar-back-from-lows-as-demand-surges", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 7:11 AM EST", "content": "Toronto home prices surged in February, and sales jumped from a 10-year low, as buyers stampeded back into the market.The benchmark price climbed 10.2 per cent in February to $846,100, the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board said Wednesday.

None of Canada\u2019s other big banks has achieved such a fevered growth rate in almost two years, with Royal Bank grabbing a greater portion of the $992.4 billion (US$742.5 billion) mortgage market spread among the country\u2019s five largest lenders.

A decision, which was expected in the last two days, is now dragging on into Friday or beyond, the people said.The crux of the debate: whether to take the highest offer, from Finnish rival Kone Oyj, despite antitrust risks or go with competing bids from private-equity suitors that don\u2019t have competition issues. The deal would be the biggest acquisition in Europe this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nInside Brookfield\u2019s empire, a complicated jigsaw of $500 billion in assets spread across the world\nAnother WeWork rival lures cash from investors that include Brookfield, CPPIB\nBrookfield to take control of Canadian mortgage insurance giant in $2.4 billion deal with Genworth\nKone\u2019s consortium increased its bid to more than 17 billion euros (US$18.4 billion) in the latest round in an attempt to widen the gulf with its rivals, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Bidding groups led by Blackstone Group Inc., Advent International and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. each offered close to 16 billion euros, according to the people.Deteriorating FinancesThyssenkrupp, once an emblem of German industrial prowess, can barely afford to wait. The steelmaker has been bruised by a manufacturing slowdown and rising pension costs. The company on Thursday announced quarterly results that laid bare the company\u2019s rapidly deteriorating finances as debt surged and losses deepened.The three private equity bidders are each pitching why they\u2019d be the best owner. Blackstone, which teamed up with Carlyle Group Inc. and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, made the highest offer among the buyout groups by this week\u2019s deadline, according to the people. A consortium including Advent, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is touting its track record doing large German deals.Brookfield, which partnered with Temasek Holdings Pte, has told labour unions it plans to reinvest in the business, the people said. Discussions are ongoing, and suitors are still making tweaks to their offers, the people said.Representatives for Advent, Blackstone, Brookfield and Kone declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp has said it will make a decision by the end of February, according to a representative for the company, who declined to comment further.Antitrust ConcernsThyssenkrupp Chief Financial Officer Johannes Dietsch said Thursday a deal with a strategic investor would mean the company only receives the money after a long, thorough antitrust review. This must be taken into account when Thyssenkrupp decides the best way forward, Dietsch said on a conference call with reporters.Shares of Thyssenkrupp were up 1.1 per cent at 9:16 a.m. Friday in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of 7 billion euros.Finland\u2019s Kone, the only remaining strategic bidder, has tried hard to address concerns about a drawn-out competition review. It plans to hand the elevator operations in Europe to bidding partner CVC Capital Partners, while offering to fully assume any antitrust risks. It has also promised a multibillion-euro upfront payment that Thyssenkrupp would keep even if the deal is blocked by competition authorities, Bloomberg News reported last month.Some executives at Thyssenkrupp fear that heavy scrutiny from European antitrust authorities on a Kone bid would lead to months of delays and perhaps the ultimate failure of the deal. The German company\u2019s aborted attempt to merge its steel business with Tata Steel Europe still haunts executives, who thought European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager unfairly torpedoed the plans.Some private equity suitors have offered major Thyssenkrupp investors the chance to keep a minority stake in the elevator unit and have discussed plans to relist the business in Germany in a few years, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Condo gains push Canadian housing starts to 4-month high", "description": "Could be good news for the nation's increasingly tight real estate markets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/canada-housing-starts-rise-to-highest-in-four-months-on-condos", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/toronto.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 10, 2020 9:18 AM EST", "content": "Canadian builders began 2020 with a strong rebound in housing starts that is good news for the nation\u2019s increasingly tight real estate markets.Work began on an annualized 213,224 units in January, up 8.8 per cent from a revised 195,892 in the prior month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said Monday in a statement.

Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.\u201cThe relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Dechaine. He also expects them to prioritize share buybacks since several of the companies have \u201cmaterial amounts\u201d of cash.Barclays analyst John Aiken raised his share price targets on Great-West, Manulife and Sun Life in a report last month and said his expectations reflect \u201cstrong profitability and an improving operating environment\u201d heading into reporting season.As their shares rally, valuations for Canadian life insurers are almost on par with banks. The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group. Once Manulife is excluded, \u201cthe sector is trading inline to historical averages and to the Big Six,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Toronto home prices rise at fastest pace in more than two years", "description": "Biggest increase since the mortgage stress test was launched", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-prices-post-fastest-annual-gain-in-over-two-years", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/housing-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 6, 2020 6:38 AM EST", "content": "A shrinking supply of available homes for sale in Canada\u2019s largest city continued to drive prices higher last month, bringing annual increases to the strongest in more than two years.Benchmark prices climbed 1 per cent in January and are up 8.7 per cent from a year earlier, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Thursday.

Tesla had added 36 per cent to its value in the first two days of the week, but by Wednesday afternoon, it was just 7.7 per cent higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12 per cent above Friday\u2019s close.The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an \u201celectrifying run\u201d on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.Tesla shares have \u201chad a Bitcoin-like move and profits are being taken off the table with technical levels being hit,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.

Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.\u201cLook, everybody has a pain threshold,\u201d Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Tom Keene Wednesday. \u201cWhen a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.\u201d The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.A sense of caution and some confusion prevailed in the market.\u201cMany investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been \u201ccalm, curious and overall cautious.\u201dThat sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping US$109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at US$887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112 per cent. Wednesday\u2019s selloff would pare that back to an year-to-date gain of 73 per cent.Wall Street is pedalling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity\u2019s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely \u201creset of expectations\u201d in the first quarter and flagging China\u2019s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added US$17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.Wednesday\u2019s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing US$11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including US$5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners\u2019 Ihor Dusaniwsky.
