Employees at the plant, who declined to be identified citing company policy, say they\u2019ve been recalled to work and have resumed vehicle-assembly operations.Tesla has roughly 20,000 employees in the San Francisco Bay area and 10,000 at the factory, which makes the Model S, X, 3 and Y.

It said Tesla can prepare \u201cfor a possible reopening as soon as next week\u201d if it follows some additional safety recommendations, and public health indicators remain stable or improve. The officials said they would work with local police \u201cto verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing, and agreed-upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production.\u201d\n\nWorkers wait in line for a shuttle at Tesla\u2019s factory on May 12, 2020.\n\nStephen Lam/Reuters\n\nMusk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive officer and largest shareholder, said Monday that Tesla was restarting production at the plant in Fremont and would defy the county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. He got support from President Donald Trump.The county and six municipalities in the densely-populated region decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let some manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities had the ability to keep stricter measures in place. The Bay area was the first region in the country to lock down via shelter in place orders and has been the most cautious about reopening, citing the need to ramp up testing capacity, contact tracing and making sure that there is an ample supply of PPE, or personal protective equipment.Musk sent an email to employees early Tuesday: \u201cJust wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!\u201d he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.Two workers who have returned to the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees\u2019 temperature using thermal scanners.\n\nA motorcyclist rides by the Tesla Fremont Factory on May 12, 2020.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe work in Fremont comes as Tesla is actively seeking a new location to build its second gigafactory. Musk has also said that Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas. He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk was not shy about suing Alameda County. Tesla filed suit against the county on Saturday.Musk has claimed COVID-19 isn\u2019t all that viral a disease, called panic about it \u201cdumb\u201d and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He\u2019s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven\u2019t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.Tesla\u2019s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen.

But companies are also considering how best to redesign their operations to prevent infections, including by automating some lines altogether. The likely result: higher costs for an industry dominated by the likes of Tyson Foods Inc. and JBS SA that\u2019s been very efficient at pumping out cheap meat.The changes are arriving as concerns mount over mega-plants staffed with low-paid workers operating elbow-to-elbow. More than 10,000 meat workers have been infected by the coronavirus, and at least 30 have died, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. \nCargill meat plant sees second death as Alberta NDP, union urges shutdown\nDoes that egg look smaller to you?

How did this happen?\n\u201cAmericans want to buy cheaper and cheaper and cheaper food,\u201d said Matthew Wadiak, founder of Cooks Venture, a small chicken producer selling directly to consumers. \u201cWe need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what\u2019s the cost of a human life? It\u2019s a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout.\u201dWorkers at meatpacking plants continue to fall ill, even with barriers placed between them, more protective equipment and enhanced social-distancing measures in common areas including cafeterias and locker rooms.While President Donald Trump has ordered plants to reopen, many are running at slower-than-usual rates to try to reduce the spread. Reducing plants to a third of their capacity and distributing the adequate protective equipment could boost chicken prices at grocery stores by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, according to Sanchoy Das, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.We need to figure out how to pay a little bit more, because what's the cost of a human life? It's a lot more than 25 cents at the checkout \n \n\u201cThe 99-cents per pound chicken could be in short supply very quickly,\u201d said Das, whose research focuses primarily on supply chain modelling and analysis.Tyson\u2019s operating costs are sharply higher due to the novel coronavirus and running into the hundreds of millions of dollars, Chief Executive Officer Noel White and Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said at the BMO Farm to Market virtual conference on Wednesday. That includes US$120 million in bonus for employees, personal protection equipment as well as factory shutdowns and slowdowns.\n\nA worker wearing protective gloves restocks chicken at a grocery store in New Jersey.\n\nAngus Mordant/Bloomberg\n\nThe bulk of America\u2019s beef and pork are processed in a few dozen giant plants that handle thousands of animals in lines that have been allowed to run faster and faster. Tyson, JBS and Cargill Inc. control about two-thirds of America\u2019s beef. Pork and chicken production is similarly concentrated.The outbreak could also help accelerate automation plans companies have already in the works. Tyson has said it is investing \u201caggressively\u201d in automating the most difficult tasks within its plants. The company is installing robots in the deboning areas of its poultry plants, and also has initiatives in beef and pork.\u201cYou are going to see a bifurcation where the larger, more profitable facilities are going to move toward a vastly more automated meat processing facility,\u201d said Decker Walker, an agribusiness expert at Boston Consulting Group. \u201cIncentives for automation have never been higher.\u201dIncentives for automation have never been higherDecker Walker \n \nPilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp. was increasing its use of automation and robotics even before the pandemic. The company invested more than US$30 million in automation last year, projects that are helping plants to run efficiently in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.\u201cWe believe in automation, we believe in robotics, and we\u2019re going to continue to move down that path,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jayson Penn said in an April 30 call with analysts.Meat processing is usually a low-margin business, meaning companies will be wary of overspending. While there\u2019s probably going to be a lot of change in the way packers do business, consumers will pay for it in the long run, said Steve Meyer, an economist at consultancy Kerns & Associates.\u201cThis whole system was designed to produce quality products at the most reasonable cost possible, so you don\u2019t go and add a lot of extra cost to go handle a once-in-a-100-year situation,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut you also don\u2019t turn a blind eye to the fact that people are sick and some people died. So I think there will be some changes made.\u201dAnother way to reduce infections, especially in poultry plants, would be to produce more whole chickens, as cutting up birds into legs and thighs requires more labor, said Das of the New Jersey Institute of Technology.Consumers in the U.S. can afford to pay a bit more for their meat, said Wadiak of Cooks Venture. That would increase wages and help avoid shared living accommodation, which has been a challenge for meat plant workers looking to adhere to social-distancing practices.\u201cWhen the budget is tight, it\u2019s hard to put food on the table, it\u2019s hard to feed your family, I really, really get that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if that means you are putting food on your table at the cost of someone else\u2019s life, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove", "title": "Under fire from investors, Teck's CEO says the miner has survived downturns before", "description": "Don Lindsay said he thinks Teck's dual-class structure, criticized by investors, will stay in place 'for the foreseeable future'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/teck-resources-ceo-says-hes-survived-collapsing-shares-before", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/don-lindsay-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 13, 2020 9:43 AM EDT", "content": "Under fire from investors who have called for his ouster, the chief executive of Teck Resources Ltd. said the miner has weathered downturns before.On Monday, Impala Asset Management LLC revealed it sent a letter to Teck\u2019s board in February, criticizing CEO Don Lindsay for decisions it says have hurt the share price and saying he is overpaid. Earlier this month, an Australian hedge fund, Tribeca Investment Partners, also called for Lindsay\u2019s replacement and said the company should divest its energy and coal businesses.Both investors are critical of Teck\u2019s dual-class share structure, which allows the Keevil family \u2014 which has been involved with the firm for more than six decades \u2014 to control the company.Most of Teck\u2019s A-shares are held by Temagami Mining Co., which is owned by the Keevil family and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.

The miner also says the stock\u2019s decline \u2014 59 per cent in the past year in Toronto \u2014 is mostly due to falling commodity prices.Lindsay reiterated that point at the virtual conference and also defended his strategy for the company.\u201cWe know that investors tend to be cautious during these phases,\u201d he said, referring to Teck\u2019s \u201cinvestment cycle\u201d in which it\u2019s ramping up its copper business and trying to boost its steelmaking-coal margins. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen something very similar before during financing and construction of another high-altitude copper mine \u2014 Antamina \u2014 which also coincided with a significant downturn in the market.\u201d\u2018Penalty Box\u2019Lindsay was referring to construction of the Antamina mine in Peru which was completed in 2001, spokesman Chris Stannell said in an email following the speech.Throughout that period, Teck\u2019s share price was in the \u201cpenalty box,\u201d Lindsay reminded analysts. \u201cBut our then-CEO and now chairman emeritus Dr. Keevil, he had the vision and the tenacity to see it through.\u201dSince then, Teck has weathered other commodity downturns.

In recent days, several workers have told her in direct messages that they are suicidal, she said.\u201cMany of these people have been isolated in their small cabins for 21 hours a day and they\u2019re breaking down from the loneliness and stress,\u201d said Thomas, who operates the pages from Vancouver, Canada. \u201cMany have been told to pack quickly to leave, and then their charter flights get canceled. Those highs and lows are taking their toll.\u201dThe cruise line operators say government policy changes and travel restrictions have complicated efforts to get crew home. More than 124 cruise ships with 94,600 workers aboard are underway or at anchor in U.S. waters, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.\u201cThat one simple question \u2013 how do we get you home? \u2013 turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,\u201d Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, wrote in a letter to crew members this month. \u201cEach country has rules and regulations for who can travel home, and how, and when. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those rules have gone in all different directions \u2013 and they frequently change without notice.\u201dAbout 15 countries won\u2019t allow their citizens to return home at all amid the pandemic, said Bayley.\n\nThis image courtesy of Caio Saldanha from Brazil, shows him in his cabin of the \u201cCelebrity Infinite\u201d on April 2020.\n\nAFP PHOTO / Courtesy of Caio Saldanha\n\nAbout 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.Royal Caribbean International has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.CDC RequirementsThe business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.Travel restrictions have also meant that in some cases, workers are shuffled from one ship to another before they can set foot on land again.Carrick and Harrison, both from the U.K., were moved to another Celebrity ship, the Reflection, a few days ago. They were told to pack to transfer to yet another ship Monday, but were given a last-minute option to remain on their current ship and then get on a charter flight to the U.K. next week.They chose the flight and have also made another important decision. After dancing on ships for more than 6 years, this will be their last voyage.\u201cThis whole experience has been a nightmare,\u201d said Carrick. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of coming back to a ship.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Siddharth Philip", "title": "Michael O\u2019Leary calls UK quarantine \u2018nonsense,\u2019 aims to resume 40% of Ryanair flights by July", "description": "Ryanair saw surge in bookings after announcement, signalling pent-up demand", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/ryanairs-oleary-calls-u-k-quarantine-nonsense-plans-restart?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/michael-oleary.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 12:54 PM EDT", "content": "Ryanair Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O\u2019Leary called the U.K.\u2019s intention to quarantine visitors for 14 days \u201cnonsense,\u201d and said the carrier may resume as many as 70 per cent of its flights by September.The Irish low-cost airline aims to restart with 40 per cent of its normal schedule in July, it said Tuesday.

Service will feature fewer checked bags, online check-ins and boarding passes that can be downloaded to smart phones, the airline said.Coordination PlansThe U.K. quarantine cast doubt on the reopening plans of other grounded European airlines as well. British Airways owner IAG SA has said it will have to review its goal to gear back up starting in July.The International Air Transport Association has called for governments to take a coordinated approach to reopening in Europe, while acknowledging the challenges.\u201cWhat it needs is a degree of synchronization, especially in regions, of what the criteria are for inbound and outbound,\u201d said Peter Morris, chief economist at Cirium. \u201cThe problem is that different countries across Europe are in different parts of the cycle.\u201dThe EU recommendations, expected Wednesday, are part of a \u201ctourism package\u201d of non-binding guidelines covering everything from health measures to travel vouchers.

In 2019, Lindsay\u2019s total compensation was $9.2 million (US$6.6 million), including $1.64 million in salary.Doug Brown, Teck\u2019s director of public affairs, said Monday that Lindsay has shareholder backing and that the company\u2019s shares are down largely because underlying commodity prices have fallen. \n\u2018Enough is enough\u2019: Hedge fund pushes Teck Resources to abandon oil and coal, replace CEO\nTeck Resources halts construction on $4.7-billion Chile copper project due to coronavirus\nInside mining companies\u2019 struggle to gain traction in the era of climate change\n\u201cAt our recent annual meeting, shareholders voted 98 per cent in support of Don and the board, indicating the strong level of support of Teck\u2019s shareholders for the company\u2019s strategy,\u201d Brown said by phone.Impala\u2019s letter alleges four projects \u2014 the 2008 acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the Neptune terminal expansion in British Columbia, and two ventures in Canada\u2019s oilsands \u2014 have destroyed over $12 billion in value.\u201cIt\u2019s been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 years,\u201d Bishop said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cThe company\u2019s paying top dollar for underperformance.\u201dIt's been nothing but poor investment decisions over the last 10 or 12 yearsBob Bishop \n \nImpala\u2019s letter was accompanied by a slide deck that referred to Lindsay\u2019s strategy as lacking \u201cclear direction or coherence,\u201d and echoed many of the valuation concerns recently made public by Tribeca Investment Partners earlier this month.Impala faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Vancouver-based Teck, Canada\u2019s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades.\n\nTeck Resources CEO Don Lindsay.\n\nCarla Gottgens/Bloomberg files\n\nAs for Teck\u2019s investment in the Fort Hills oilsands project in Alberta, Brown said: \u201cWe have been very clear that if we can\u2019t see the value reflected in our share price, we will not hesitate to pursue other options for realizing value, including divestment at the appropriate time.\u201dImpala owned 1.9 per cent of Class B shares outstanding at the end of 2019, making it a top-10 shareholder, according to Bloomberg data.The share structure is a major impediment to change, Bishop said.\u201cThe dual-class share structure was originally meant to protect the Class B shareholders if there was a low-ball bid for the company,\u201d Bishop said. Instead, \u201cit has allowed bad decision-making to occur without any repercussions.\u201dChair MeetingIn March, Bishop says he and another Impala representative met with Teck\u2019s chairwoman, Sheila Murray, and vice chairman Norman Keevil III, to follow up on their letter but came away with little conviction things will change. \u201cThese have been poor investment decisions by this CEO, approved by mostly this board, and we\u2019re expecting the same people who got us into this mess to get us out of this mess.\u201dBishop, who worked as chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management before founding Impala, said his views are broadly aligned with those of Tribeca, although he puts more value on Teck\u2019s zinc and copper assets. He also said he\u2019s less optimistic about how much the miner could get from the sale of its metallurgical coal division.Both investors think the stock is dramatically undervalued, with Bishop estimating they could at least triple under the right management.\u201cIf they did the right thing tomorrow I think the stock price would go up 40 per cent in one day,\u201d he said.Tribeca DemandsTribeca Investments partner Ben Cleary sent a letter to Teck this month demanding the mining giant overhaul its management team while divesting its coal and oil operations to attract green-conscious investors.He said Impala was just one of many peers with similar views on how to change Teck and boost its share price. Sydney-based Tribeca has spoken to investors representing over 20 per cent of the Class B shares since the campaign began, with all being broadly supportive of its goals, he added.Cleary expects Teck\u2019s directors to split the demands into one of two buckets: the deliverable and undeliverable.\u201cIf you were an independent director then management change, divestment of assets, dividend policies and ESG are all in the deliverable camp,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shareholding structure is probably in the \u2018undeliverable\u2019 so the focus to me is on the first few in the short term.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth", "title": "Stocks tumble after double whammy of warnings from Fauci and Fed over pandemic economy", "description": "Central bank officials cited risk of the potential for massive bankruptcies that could create a lasting scar", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/european-stocks-gain-while-u-s-futures-edge-lower-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fearless-girl.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 4:33 AM EDT", "content": "Stocks tumbled after a U.S. official warned against a premature reopening of the economy amid a dire outlook from Federal Reserve regional chiefs.

This week its private equity unit, Brookfield Business Partners LP, said it had invested about $500 million in public companies with the goal of potentially taking some of them private.Its real estate arm, Brookfield Property Partners, said it too had shifted its focus to the public markets, with $8 billion in dry power sitting on its books and dearth of large deals to be had.\u201cWe began investing in the capital markets aggressively in March but have pulled back somewhat in April as the markets quickly recovered,\u201d Sam Pollock, Brookfield Infrastructure\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter. \u201cWe would describe our current investment posture as optimistically patient.\u201dBrookfield Infrastructure said on a conference call Friday it is focused on 10 to 15 names, primarily in North America and Europe. It didn\u2019t disclose its targets. While it managed to invest in some of them during the sell-off, the list of attractive companies has narrowed as the market recovered, the firm said.Ports, Rail Take HitWhile Brookfield\u2019s infrastructure assets have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent social distancing measures, it remains well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that arise, Pollock said. Brookfield Infrastructure has roughly $4.3 billion in liquidity after a bond issuance in April and a $1 billion increase to its revolving credit facility.Brookfield tends to be a counter-cyclical investor, searching for investments in countries and sectors that are out of favor. Pollock said the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis, when turmoil in markets led Brookfield to a major deal with Australia\u2019s Babcock & Brown Infrastructure about a year after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.Roughly 70% of Brookfield Infrastructure\u2019s funds from operations is from its utilities, energy and data infrastructure segments, which are expected to see little impact from Covid-19, he said. Other parts of its business, including railways, ports, and toll roads, are more exposed to a downturn.April volumes in its rail segment fell 7% below planned levels. It saw declines of about 15% in container volumes in the first quarter, with volumes from Asia down because of the lockdowns.Those numbers rebounded quickly as China reopened its economy but are still 10% below expected volumes. Its toll roads business has also seen a 40% decline in volumes due the coronavirus.\u201cOur outlook for the balance of the year is guided by the current state of affairs and the cautious approach most governments are taking towards opening up their economies,\u201d Pollock said, adding that he expects non-essential businesses to largely remain closed through the second quarter.Pollock said he expected the recovery to be more a \u2018swoosh\u2019 shape than \u2018U\u2019 or a \u2018V\u2019 with the aid of government stimulus. He said he expects most sectors and businesses to return to a more normal environment by the end of 2020 or first half of 2021, assuming there is not significant second wave of the virus.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji, Doug Alexander and Jack Witzig", "title": "As Shopify passes RBC to become No. 1, the Canada market curse gets put to the test", "description": "Those that leapfrogged the value of Canada's largest bank in the past have faltered \u2014 think Valeant, BlackBerry and Nortel", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/as-shopifys-value-surpasses-rbc-market-curse-gets-put-to-test?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/shopify-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 8, 2020 11:11 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc. surged on Wednesday to become Canada\u2019s most valuable company \u2014 but can the e-commerce giant survive being No. 1?Ottawa-based Shopify edged past Royal Bank of Canada to become the largest publicly listed company in Canada. The achievement comes with a dubious distinction, however: those that leapfrogged the value of Canada\u2019s largest bank in the past have faltered.Royal Bank, incorporated in 1869, has been Canada\u2019s most valuable company for years, but has been been eclipsed on a few occasions. Shopify closed with a market value of $121.3 billion ($85.6 billion), surpassing Royal Bank\u2019s $120.5 billion. \nShopify becomes Canada\u2019s most valuable company after quarter beats expectations on back of pandemic\nShopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge\nShopify pushes past TD to become Canada\u2019s second-biggest stock\nThe last company to surpass Royal Bank\u2019s market capitalization was drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. in July 2015. Months later, the value of the Quebec-based company plunged amid controversies over business practices, accounting and drug pricing. Valeant has since been renamed Bausch Health Companies Inc. and has new management and a different ticker symbol.Before that, BlackBerry Ltd. \u2014 the inventor of the smartphone and then known as Research in Motion Ltd. \u2014 crossed Royal Bank briefly in 2007. It held the top spot for about five months in 2008, before Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and other handset makers rose up to steal its market away.Further back, Nortel Networks Corp. became the biggest Canadian company in 2000, swelling to a market value of $366 billion and accounting for as much as 35 per cent of Canada\u2019s benchmark index, before crashing in the tech wreck.

So Shopify\u2019s rise has been cheered on by many.\u201cI think it\u2019s obvious in hindsight the leadership of both those companies got disconnected from their underlying markets,\u201d said Eric Jackson, founder of a Toronto-based tech-focused hedge fund EMJ Capital Ltd., referring to BlackBerry and Nortel.Jackson believes Shopify \u201cshould be held up as a poster child for what Canada should be trying to encourage in it\u2019s tech sector because it\u2019s been remarkable what they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. Jackson had owned the company\u2019s stock but doesn\u2019t currently have a position.

RBC was incorporated in 1869.Shopify sells tools to help companies set up an online store, a business model seen flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic that has shuttered bricks and mortar stores.

A representative for Midland, Michigan-based Dow declined comment.The potential divestitures echo moves across the industry to focus on manufacturing chemicals efficiently while hiving off responsibility for running the ground infrastructure, from power supplies to transportation.

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.\u201cIt will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men\u2019s jobs affected,\u201d according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers \u2014 where many women work \u2014 is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a \u201cshe-cession,\u201d April\u2019s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Construction in CrosshairsBrendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday\u2019s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn\u2019t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. \u201cThe hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,\u201d Bernard said by phone.While Friday\u2019s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it\u2019s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.\u201cThat\u2019s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cThe job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.\u201dPath to RecoveryThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won\u2019t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.\u201cOnce things start to return to normal, it\u2019s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,\u201d Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.\u201cWe are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,\u201d Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis. Without childcare, women may opt to stay at home to take care of their kids and out of work for longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Olga Kharif", "title": "Bitcoin is staging a comeback reminiscent of the 2017 bubble frenzy", "description": "In anticipation for a technical event that may be a new catalyst, Bitcoin has rallied to more than US$9,000 from around US$6,000 just a month ago", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/bitcoin-is-staging-a-comeback-reminiscent-of-2017-bubble-frenzy", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/bitcoin.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 2:50 PM EDT", "content": "It\u2019s been left for dead more than once, written off as nothing but a bubble and denounced as rat poison by one of the world\u2019s most famous investors. Yet Bitcoin is once again staging a comeback reminiscent of the token\u2019s glory days, with evangelists pegging their hopes on a technical event as the new catalyst.True believers say the gains are driven by Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving, when the rewards miners receive for processing transactions will be cut in half as soon as May 12. The internet is glutted with second-by-second countdown clocks and the mania is even spurring a hike in hiring by crypto firms worldwide. Bitcoin has rallied to more than US$9,000 in anticipation from around US$6,000 just a month ago.\u201cNarratives in the world of blockchain act like the Force in Star Wars \u2014 they mysteriously move and shape the market,\u201d said George McDonaugh, co-founder of crypto and blockchain investment firm KR1. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be blamed for getting a little excited about what\u2019s to come.\u201d \nBank of Canada lays groundwork for digital currency\nShopify signs on to join Facebook\u2019s embattled Libra cryptocurrency plan\nBitcoin breaks through $10,000 level with traders setting their sights on $11,000\nBitcoin halvings, which slow down the rate at which new tokens are created, happen once every four years or so. Its third such event is set to occur next week. Skeptics argue crypto prices are notoriously volatile and often difficult to pin explanations to, positing that any appreciation should be priced in ahead of time. But crypto fans cite historical precedent.Bitcoin\u2019s undergone two prior halvings \u2014 or halvenings, as they\u2019re sometimes called \u2014 which saw its price appreciate in the aftermath. The world\u2019s largest token rose from around US$12 to over US$1,000 in the year following its 2012 cut in rewards, and advanced about 1,000 per cent in the wake of the 2016 halving, though that reduction happened at a time when the coin was gaining greater mainstream recognition.The frenzy around digital currencies took it to near US$20,000 the following year before it crashed, with the coin still trading about 50 per cent below 2017\u2019s all-time highs.But Bitcoin has historically bottomed 459 days prior to the halving, risen leading into the event and exploded to the upside afterward, according to research from Pantera Capital. Post-halving rallies have averaged 446 days \u2014 should history repeat itself, Bitcoin could peak around August 2021.Wallet growth has also spiked, rising 2 per cent in April, the largest monthly increase since at least November. To Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research, there\u2019s two possible explanations: bored, locked-down gamblers and sports betters are finding their way into cryptocurrencies amid the coronavirus shutdown, while many are also getting excited about Bitcoin\u2019s halving, he wrote in a recent note.Price PredictionsTo be sure, many crypto fans also point to unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus unleashed by central banks around the world as a catalyst for prices to advance. Whatever the reason, the recent bull-run hype has ushered in the return of sky-high price targets.Global Macro Investor\u2019s Raoul Pal projects Bitcoin could reach US$1 million in the next three- to five years. Though the halving isn\u2019t the key driver behind his prediction, it could be a potential accelerant.\u201cIt is already the best performing asset in all recorded history,\u201d Pal wrote in a recent presentation. \u201cIt was born out of the financial crisis for exactly what is about to come in this crisis. This is literally what Bitcoin was invented for.\u201dJefferies LLC analyst Christopher Wood in his weekly \u201cGreed & Fear\u201d newsletter recommended investors \u2014 including institutions \u2014 buy Bitcoin ahead of the halving, citing the token\u2019s prior price surges around the event.\u201cTo invest in Bitcoin it is necessary to believe the system has integrity in the sense that the supply is truly limited,\u201d he wrote. The digital token should be a source of diversification \u201cprecisely because of its truly decentralized nature,\u201d he said.Critics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it's by far the best performing asset of the past decadeAntoni Trenchev \n \nVenture capitalist Tim Draper predicts Bitcoin could hit US$250,000 by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. \u201cBitcoin adoption will spread because Bitcoin is simply a better currency than any of the political currencies that are tied to governments and political whims,\u201d he said, citing fiscal and monetary stimulus as possible accelerators for adoption.To Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing director of crypto-lender Nexo, Bitcoin could reach US$50,000 by the end of the year, implying a 470 per cent surge from current levels. Though the halving may already be priced in, it will lead to huge appreciation over time, he said.\u201cCritics can disparage Bitcoin as much as they like, but it\u2019s by far the best performing asset of the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re bullish about its future.\u201dTrenchev is seeing \u201chuge\u201d demand for his firm\u2019s products ahead of the coin\u2019s halving. \u201cWe\u2019re not hiring because of the halving per se. We\u2019re hiring because the halving has been lifting Bitcoin and will continue to do so,\u201d he said.Hiring HikeA number of crypto exchanges have also embarked on hiring sprees. Kraken LLC and Binance Holdings Ltd. are expanding their workforces, as are OkEx and Coinbase Inc.David Janczewski, the chief executive officer and founder of Cardiff, Wales-based Coincover, said any market event that impacts adoption is a positive for his business.\u201cThat\u2019s part of what we see \u2014 when the last spike happened, we know that an awful lot of people moved into the market because they felt they ought to get in on the action,\u201d said Janczewski, whose firm offers insurance against crypto thefts and scams. \u201cUltimately, anything that causes the market to be aware, or wider investment markets to be aware of crypto, tends to be a good thing from our perspective.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Lizette Chapman", "title": "Uber Is Reducing Workforce by 14% and Signals More Cuts to Come", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Uber Technologies Inc. will eliminate 3,700 jobs and permanently close 180 driver service centers, the first in a series of cost-cutting measures to be announced in the next ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/uber-is-reducing-workforce-by-14-and-signals-more-cuts-to-come", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 1:28 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Uber Technologies Inc. will eliminate 3,700 jobs and permanently close 180 driver service centers, the first in a series of cost-cutting measures to be announced in the next two weeks as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.The reductions will affect 14% of staff around the world, mainly those in support and recruiting, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive officer, wrote in an email to employees Wednesday. Ridership is down significantly, and the company is maintaining a freeze on hiring, Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada.Khosrowshahi signaled that more \u201cdifficult adjustments\u201d would be put forth in the next two weeks. \u201cDays like this are brutal,\u201d he wrote.This sort of painful day is becoming commonplace. Tech companies have eliminated more than 38,000 jobs in the past two months, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the job market. Lyft Inc., the main alternative to Uber in North America, said last week it was dismissing 17% of staff, furloughing more and reducing salaries. Their longtime peer in the sharing economy, Airbnb Inc., said Tuesday the company was cutting a quarter of its workforce.The job losses are sudden for many, but at Uber, they may seem drawn out. After a disappointing initial public offering a year ago, Uber dismissed more than 1,000 employees over multiple rounds of cuts that extended from July to what Khosrowshahi described as a \u201clast wave\u201d in October. They were part of a drive toward profitability, which was expected to arrive by the end of this year.Uber has seen its landscape shift considerably since then. It instituted a hiring freeze in March, withdrew its financial forecast and wrote down some $2 billion worth of investments in April and said Monday it would shutter food delivery operations in seven countries.As of May 2, Khosrowshahi waived his salary for the remainder of the year, the company said. In 2019, he was eligible for a salary of $1 million and a bonus of $2 million, according to a securities filing. Uber is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results Thursday.The challenges posed by the virus could be matched by a new one this week from Uber\u2019s home state. California sued Uber and Lyft Tuesday for allegedly flouting a state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees. If the case is successful, the companies could be on the hook for substantial new costs that further jeopardize their business models.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jack Farchy", "title": "HSBC Reveals It Was Caught Out as Lockdowns Snarled Gold Market", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 HSBC Holdings Plc, one of the largest players in the gold market, was caught out in March as lockdowns disrupted physical shipments of bullion and caused prices to ...", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/hsbc-reveals-it-was-caught-out-as-lockdowns-snarled-gold-market", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 6, 2020 1:17 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 HSBC Holdings Plc, one of the largest players in the gold market, was caught out in March as lockdowns disrupted physical shipments of bullion and caused prices to diverge dramatically in key trading hubs.In a filing, the bank cited \u201cdelivery disruptions in the gold market\u201d as one reason why it breached its value-at-risk limits 12 times in March \u2014 something it would normally expect to occur only two or three times a year.The price of gold futures in New York and spot gold in London diverged by the most in four decades at the end of March, after refinery closures and grounded planes strangled the supply routes that allow physical gold to move around the globe.

And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a \u201cfire\u201d that could be extinguished \u201cfast.\u201dHe also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriorsDonald Trump \n \n\u201cThese models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They\u2019ve been so wrong, they\u2019ve been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d the president said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said earlier Tuesday the Johns Hopkins model, included in a government document obtained Monday by the New York Times, relied on \u201cfaulty assumptions\u201d about mitigation efforts and didn\u2019t represent federal government projections.\u201cThe people of our country are warriors,\u201d Trump said of Americans, some 69 per cent of whom are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d worried about contracting Covid-19, according to an analysis of polls by fivethirtyeight.com.Vice President Mike Pence said earlier Tuesday the White House has begun discussing disbanding the coronavirus task force, which could happen as soon as later this month.\u201cMike Pence and the task force have done a great job, but we\u2019re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening.

The alternative would have been to stand back and watch as companies fell and workers were left stranded, ultimately digging an even bigger economic hole to fill once the crisis passes.The challenge is how and when to unwind all of this support without setting off the kind of political and ideological bushfires that will burn for years. The longer authorities remain in the market \u2014 whether it\u2019s a controlling stake in an airline or backstopping loans to energy companies \u2014 the greater the risk of collateral damage.The dilemma is real and will play out in legislatures and policy meetings for years to come. Cutting and running too soon risks stripping away a vital safety net that both companies and workers may still need. Staying too long risks crowding out private players.Big government may be back, but how long it\u2019s welcome is another story.Global HeadlinesPhase two | President Donald Trump fixed his course on reopening the nation for business, acknowledging that the move would cause more illness and death from the pandemic but insisting it\u2019s a cost he\u2019s willing to pay to get the economy back on track. Trump presented the imminent easing of stay-at-home rules as a fait accompli, as governors across the South and Midwest have begun returning people to work.Trump said White House officials are discussing disbanding the task force that has helmed the federal virus response efforts so far.Blame game | China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. said allegations faulting Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus risked a \u201cdecoupling\u201d of the world\u2019s two largest economies. In a column published in the Washington Post, Ambassador Cui Tiankai called for an end to the \u201cblame game,\u201d saying that increased suspicions threatened to hurt U.S.-China cooperation to fight the pandemic and restart the global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries,\u201d he said.Spreading charges | Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wanted to replace the chief of the federal police in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political career, former Justice Minister Sergio Moro told investigators. The accusation adds to his previous one that Bolsonaro tried to meddle in police work by naming a family friend as top cop at the institution akin to the U.S.\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Abandoning caution | The unusual unity that has permeated Germany since the pandemic arrived is starting to fray as pressure grows on Chancellor Angela Merkel to speed up the country\u2019s exit from lockdown. With Europe\u2019s biggest economy forecast to shrink 6.3% this year, business and industry lobbies are clamoring for Merkel to throw off her caution and allow more commerce. Merkel meets with state leaders today to forge a consensus on reopening.Getting closer | With a Friday deadline looming, Argentina and its biggest creditors are suggesting possible revisions to the country\u2019s $65 billion debt restructuring proposal that could help break an impasse. While both sides are uncompromising in public, behind closed doors they are showing some willingness to improve the terms of the exchange and continue talks, Bloomberg reports. The pressure is still on, however: crucial bond payments come due May 22.What to WatchThe EU warned today that the 27-nation bloc is facing the deepest economic downturn in its history, threatening the future of the euro if the crisis is badly handled.

Try UraniumBy Clara Ferreira Marques(Bloomberg Opinion) \u2014 Uranium is having a moment in 2020, climbing a\u00a0third in six weeks while much\u00a0of the commodities universe melts down.\u00a0Years of poor economics and weak investment, combined with the impact of\u00a0pandemic-related mine closures, are\u00a0adding up to a supply squeeze, despite demand\u00a0softened\u00a0by industrial\u00a0lockdowns. There will be\u00a0no swift return to lofty levels\u00a0last seen over a decade ago, but the metal\u00a0may still be the only\u00a0one to\u00a0end the year with a\u00a0record shortage and higher prices.The start of the last bull run\u00a0had plenty of similarities to today. Supply was suffering the effect of a long run of unimpressive prices. Thanks to revived interest in nuclear power, the spot market price for uranium surged\u00a0by a factor of 13\u00a0between 2003 and 2007.\u00a0That hastened a production\u00a0splurge\u00a0that\u00a0put the industry into a steady downward slide, worsened\u00a0by the Fukushima disaster in 2011. It\u00a0then bumped along at levels that, adjusted for inflation, were near historic lows.With little incentive to explore or produce\u00a0more at depressed\u00a0prices, the supply-demand balance was still delicate even in 2019. Then the coronavirus epidemic struck, triggering even more curtailments\u00a0at top producers Kazatomprom and Cameco Corp., among others. Canada\u2019s\u00a0Cameco has suspended production at\u00a0its giant Cigar Lake mine in Saskatchewan.\u00a0Kazakhstan\u2019s behemoth, meanwhile, expects a deficit for 2020 and quoted third-party estimates\u00a0Monday that primary uranium supply could decrease over 10% from a year earlier. Chinese operations in Nambia have been impacted.It\u2019s true that almost all metals have seen a blow\u00a0to supply from Covid-19, yet for the most part that\u2019s\u00a0dwarfed by the drop in demand from customers,\u00a0whose own factories have been\u00a0shut down. For uranium, despite some reactor closures and longer stretches of maintenance, appetite is a lot less flexible. Production has taken a worse hit. Analysts at BMO estimate that 2020 production expectations are already down by a fifth compared to\u00a0earlier forecasts. Copper, despite stark headlines, has fallen a fraction of that. Only\u00a0platinum, dented by restrictions in South Africa, has tumbled\u00a0by anything like the same magnitude.The shock has been sharply felt. Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange are trading at around $34\u00a0per pound, up from $24 in mid-March. Shares in Cameco have almost doubled from March lows. Others\u00a0have climbed, too:\u00a0London-listed Yellow Cake Plc, which purchases and stores physical uranium, is up by roughly half. Exchange-traded funds like North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF and Horizons Global Uranium Index ETF\u00a0have recovered\u00a0from their 2020 nadirs.The real question\u00a0is what happens next. Even\u00a0$34 is far below the price required to encourage digging. A\u00a0significant proportion of producers still don\u2019t\u00a0make money at those levels, once expenditures to maintain production are included. Meanwhile, utilities\u00a0are sitting on a still-substantial four\u00a0years or so of inventory and can afford to wait a little longer before piling in to buy, even if there is already anecdotal evidence of activity. It\u00a0could take until almost the middle of the decade for them to\u00a0get back to, say, three years of material.Yet a market now firmly in deficit\u00a0will keep\u00a0upward pressure on. Analysts at BMO\u00a0estimate that the long-term incentive price for miners\u00a0is close\u00a0to $55, though\u00a0existing idled assets could come back at above $40. Even\u00a0an approval today\u00a0won\u2019t ease the squeeze fast: A\u00a0new uranium operation takes years.Then there\u2019s demand. Nuclear power is still growing despite fading enthusiasm in developed markets. It\u00a0remains a key source of low-carbon energy, and that matters as\u00a0traditional users find their reactors are aging,\u00a0and need to be either decommissioned or replaced. Without nuclear energy, energy transition is tougher:\u00a0The International Energy Agency estimates that over the past 50 years, nuclear power has avoided carbon dioxide\u00a0emissions almost\u00a0equivalent to\u00a0two years of those related to\u00a0global energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a\u00a0renewed preoccupation\u00a0with its reactors and reserves.There is always the risk of a return to past supply excesses\u00a0when it comes to a metal that\u00a0isn\u2019t rare, in geological terms, and the potential exists for more recycling,\u00a0too.\u00a0For now, uranium has some rare radiance.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don\u2019t like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things.

Even the location is being kept under wraps. But Buffett and a top deputy, Greg Abel, will be there, doing their best in a virtual meeting to make sense of an economy upended by the coronavirus pandemic.Even without the event\u2019s usual trappings, interest is, if anything, even more intense than usual. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, has been relatively quiet over the past month as the global response to the pandemic escalated, drawing questions about his view of what might be in store for the markets, Berkshire\u2019s businesses and the global economy.\u201cThe tone will be different,\u201d said Richard Cook, a shareholder who has missed just two meetings since attending his first in 1997. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly miss all these chances to see all those friends.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., center left, eats a Dairy Queen ice cream bar while touring the shopping floor ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday, May 4, 2019.

In one of Buffett\u2019s only public comments since the outbreak caused companies and communities to shut down across the U.S., the CEO in March called oil volatility and the panic hitting markets a \u201cbig one-two punch.\u201dHis Berkshire Hathaway has likewise stayed in the shadows, a contrast to the financial crisis in 2008, when the Omaha-based company dipped into its vast cash reserves to gain lucrative preferred shares and rescue businesses teetering on the edge of collapse. \nWarren Buffett\u2019s \u2019Woodstock for Capitalists\u2019 to be held virtually this weekend, but without Charlie Munger\nWarren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Fortress\u2019 is breached by coronavirus-related shutdowns\nStock markets are surging, but has this rebound come too far, too fast?\nBuffett, now with roughly $128 billion in cash, hasn\u2019t announced any large public deals even as the S&P 500 tumbled 20% in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, left, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger at the annual Berkshire shareholder shopping day in 2019. Munger won\u2019t be attending this year.\n\nReuters/Scott Morgan/File Photo\n\nCharlie Munger, a Berkshire vice chairman who in normal years fields questions at the meeting with Buffett, offered one explanation in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in early April. The conglomerate wants to come out of the coronavirus \u201ctyphoon\u201d with lots of liquidity, Munger said, adding that many corporate executives are frozen in place as they try to figure out how to handle the crisis.Berkshire\u2019s phone isn\u2019t ringing off the hook, he told the newspaper.Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said it\u2019s possible Berkshire will still make a move. \u201cBut the other thing is, when you have the government becoming the lender of last resort, you don\u2019t necessarily need Berkshire to be the lender of last resort,\u201d she said.Berkshire plans to start its event at 3:45 p.m. Omaha time on Saturday, with Buffett and Abel fielding questions shareholders sent to three hand-picked journalists. The company is set to release first-quarter results earlier that day.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe decline in Berkshire's equity portfolio was about $66 billion at quarter end, and a steep drop in Berkshire's stock increases the potential for buybacksAnalysts Matthew Palazola and Derek Han \n \nThe company warned that the pair would steer clear of political questions and discussions about specific holdings at the meeting, which has morphed from a small gathering in the lunchroom of one of Buffett\u2019s insurers into a sprawling event the billionaire has called a \u201cWoodstock for Capitalists.\u201dHere are some of the topics that might come up:StocksThe company\u2019s first-quarter earnings report will give investors a better sense of whether Buffett and his investing deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, found opportunities in the turmoil caused by the virus.Berkshire\u2019s quarterly filing usually discloses how much in stocks the company purchased during the quarter and the total size of the investment portfolio, including its largest holdings. Berkshire recently disclosed that it pared back stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nA view of the crowd at the shareholders meeting in 2018.\n\nDavid Williams/Bloomberg\n\nOccidentalBuffett\u2019s bet on Occidental Petroleum Corp., made just before his annual meeting last year, may draw questions. The oil producer slashed its common stock dividend in March for the first time in three decades as the plunge in oil prices weighed on the company.As part of Buffett\u2019s investment, Berkshire obtained preferred stock that helped finance Occidental\u2019s US$37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. That investment pays a hefty 8 per cent annual dividend. But Occidental recently opted to pay Berkshire\u2019s quarterly dividend in shares rather than cash as the company looks for ways to conserve funds. In some ways, the Berkshire dividend that Occidental has to meet has ended up leaving others worse off, according to KBW\u2019s Shields.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t think that was the intention, but I think it may be a bit of a discouragement from some people looking at Berkshire capital and saying, \u2018Hey, this is expensive, but it\u2019s got this great ringing endorsement,\u2019 because that\u2019s not how it\u2019s working out,\u201d Shields said.Berkshire\u2019s also been building a common stock investment in Occidental, a stake that was valued at about US$780 million at the end of 2019.Insurance ClaimsChubb Ltd. CEO Evan Greenberg had a stark warning about the effect of the pandemic and shutdowns: It will likely be the largest event in insurance-industry history because it affects both sides of the balance sheet.Berkshire owns a collection of companies in the industry, with some that offer commercial-property insurance, workers\u2019 compensation coverage and health-care liability policies. And some of its companies are reinsurers, which essentially write policies for other insurers.Auto insurers, such as Berkshire\u2019s Geico, have actually returned some funds or offered premium credits to consumers as driving decreases, which could translate into fewer accidents. The industry may also see potential claims from canceled events and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201cIt\u2019s so different based on the insurance product line,\u201d Shields said. \u201cThere are some lines that have major questions,\u201d especially with business-interruption coverage.Succession QuestionsBuffett, 89, and Munger, 96, routinely field questions about succession at the conglomerate. Berkshire\u2019s decision in early 2018 to appoint Abel and Ajit Jain to the board was part of a movement to address succession, Buffett said at the time.Still, both Abel and Jain have remained behind the scenes to some extent, tending to Berkshire\u2019s collection of businesses. Buffett told investors in this year\u2019s annual letter that the pair would field more questions at this year\u2019s annual meeting. But now only Abel, who lives closer to Omaha, will join Buffett at the event.\u201cIt\u2019s really, really important,\u201d Shields said. While there\u2019s no indication that any change would happen now, \u201cat some point in time, it\u2019s not just that one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett, it\u2019s that maybe one of these guys takes over for Warren Buffett in a period of unprecedented change.\u201dPandemic FalloutCoronavirus fallout will hit Berkshire in varying ways.

The company should also scrap its dual-class shares to boost returns, the Australian fund with US$1.6 billion in assets said in a letter to the board. \nWhy Teck decided to shelve its controversial oilsands project\nWhy Teck decided to shelve its controversial oilsands project\nThe era of the mega oilsands mine may be over after \u2018nail in the coffin\u2019 from Teck cancellation\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a very steady de-rating of the company versus its peers over the last five years and if they continue to do nothing they can only see that continue,\u201d said Tribeca partner Ben Cleary, citing overhauls at Teck rivals Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group as examples of a better way forward.A spokesman for Vancouver-based Teck said the company hasn\u2019t received the letter. \u201cI can point out though that Don received 98 per cent votes in favour of appointment at our recent AGM,\u201d Doug Brown, director of public affairs, said by phone.\n\nTeck Resources CEO Don Lindsay.\n\nRodrigo Garrido/Reuters files\n\n\u201cThe Board has full confidence in Don Lindsay and the rest of Teck\u2019s management,\u201d Sheila Murray, Teck\u2019s chairwoman, said in an emailed statement.Tribeca faces entrenched ownership and management in its battle with Teck, Canada\u2019s biggest diversified mining company. The Keevil family controls Teck through dual-class shares, and has been involved with the firm for more than six decades. Tribeca holds a 1.8 per cent stake, worth about US$85 million at the current share price.Stock PlungeThe activist pressure comes at a difficult time for Teck, whose stock has tumbled about 60 per cent in the last 12 months amid the oil rout and the plunge in prices for its copper, zinc and steel-making coal. The company\u2019s market value has dropped below US$5 billion, after touching a four-year low last month.The miner has been forced to temporarily suspend its Quebrada Blanca copper expansion in Chile because of the coronavirus pandemic, while its metallurgical coal and energy divisions have been beset with problems this year. The miner is considering halting production at the Fort Hills oil sands mine in Alberta, and pulled the plug on a planned multi-billion oil project in February.Tribeca, a Teck holder for three years, is launching its campaign now because \u201cenough is enough,\u201d Cleary said in a phone interview from Singapore, where he works for the Sydney-based firm.Tribeca\u2019s previous activist campaign against BHP, which coincided with a similar push by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management Corp., helped prompt the world\u2019s biggest miner to sell a suite of U.S. shale assets and reshuffle its board, resulting in billions of dollars returned to investors, the fund says.Cleary said Tribeca had held informal discussions with other major Teck investors about its complaints. He declined to name them and said Tribeca wasn\u2019t working with other investors. Teck\u2019s biggest institutional shareholders include China Investment Corp., the sovereign wealth fund, according to Bloomberg data.While Lindsay has previously said the zinc and copper division could be twice the size of its coal arm once the Quebrada Blanca mine is fully developed, and has raised the possibility of spinning off oil assets, the changes would require a fundamental shift for the company.Management MovesLast year the coal and metals segments each accounted for roughly 46 per cent of revenue, with energy making up the rest. Tribeca is calling for Teck to sell or spin off its 21 per cent stake in the Fort Hills oil project and unload its coal business to focus on copper, zinc and possibly nickel.The fund also expressed frustration with the board and questioned why it hasn\u2019t sought to oust Lindsay, who has been in charge since 2005, making him one of the longest-serving CEOs in the sector. Over that time, Teck\u2019s shares have dropped more than a quarter including dividends, lagging gains by Rio Tinto and BHP.\u201cThere is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years,\u201d the fund says in its letter.There is no sugar coating the underperformance of the company over the last 15 years \n \nTeck shares would also get a boost from scrapping the dual-class shares, making the company a take-over target, the fund argues in its letter dated April 30.Family patriach Norman Keevil stepped down as chairman in 2018, though his son Norman Keevil III remains on the board as vice chairman. Former Chairman Dominic Barton, now Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, said two years ago that neither family control nor the dual-class shares are going anywhere.\u201cI don\u2019t see this as a \u2018Keevils or nothing\u2019 issue because the Keevils want to make money as much as the minority shareholders want to maximize their investment,\u201d Cleary said, adding Tribeca has expressed its concerns to the family. Even if the share structure were left alone, Teck could undertake the other measures and enjoy a substantial boost, he said.ESG PushThe hedge fund\u2019s campaign to push Teck out of the fossil-fuels business isn\u2019t driven by green ideology. A good portion of the fund\u2019s investments are in oil transportation and service providers. The metallurgical coal produced by Teck is used mainly for steel making and not for burning in power plants.Even so, it believes that cutting off oil and coal would attract the rising pool of pension funds and family offices that are restricting their investments in companies based on their environmental impact.\u201cYou can either do something now and see a material upside or you can continue to de-rate and be an orphan stock in the global materials universe,\u201d Cleary said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dana Hull, Gabrielle Coppola and Ed Ludlow", "title": "'Give people back their goddamn freedom': Musk's rant puts Tesla's hot streak at risk", "description": "Tesla is worried about being able to resume production in the San Francisco Bay area, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/musk-decries-fascist-orders-putting-teslas-hot-streak-at-risk", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/musk.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 30, 2020 8:44 AM EDT", "content": "Elon Musk went on a profane rant during another emotive Tesla Inc. earnings call, excoriating stay-at-home orders that are putting the electric-car maker\u2019s red-hot run at risk.\u201cThis is fascist.

It doesn\u2019t change the reality, which is that Tesla is making meaningful progress toward being a major player in the auto industry.\u201dThe stock surge Musk, 48, has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned him to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago.By continuing to build up the shares, bulls are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in Fremont, California, or how eager consumers will be to purchase Tesla cars once health orders are loosened and lifted.\u201cIt is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,\u201d Tesla said in its quarterly update. \u201cDue to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.\u201dDuring the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5 per cent, the highest in a year and a half.While Tesla stopped short of restating its January forecast for deliveries to \u201ccomfortably\u201d exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.\u201cGross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,\u201d Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. \u201cOn the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn\u2019t talk about demand at all.\u201dTesla managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter, despite being forced to suspend production at its factory in California late last month. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about US$895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with US$8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla\u2019s semi truck again to 2021 \u2014 roughly two years later than initially planned \u2014 as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany from which it aims to begin shipping cars in the middle of next year.\u201cTesla investors are looking past the June quarter,\u201d Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. \u201cThe bulls could take this and run.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dina Bass", "title": "Microsoft sales rise as remote working buoys cloud services", "description": "Microsoft CEO's years-long push for the company to focus on cloud software pays off", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/microsoft-sales-rise-as-remote-working-buoys-cloud-services", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/microsoft.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 4:43 PM EDT", "content": "Microsoft Corp. said quarterly sales and profit rose, buoyed by demand for internet-based software and cloud services needed to accommodate a shift to remote working during the coronavirus crisis.Profit in the period ended March 31 rose to US$10.8 billion, or US$1.40 a share, the company said Wednesday in a statement.

The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "K.

Now recovering, the Hernandezes and 98 fellow passengers have sued Costa Cruise Lines Inc., a brand owned by Carnival Corp., alleging the firm endangered passengers\u2019 lives through negligence and bad decision-making.A Costa spokeswoman said the company stepped up its sanitation of ships and then took action, including quarantining passengers, after it learned of the positive test results.The Hernandezes and their fellow plaintiffs are seeking class-action status. They may have rough sailing ahead.The tickets that cruise passengers buy resemble legal contracts, and they generally contain language barring customers from filing class-action suits \u2013 lawsuits that allow one or more plaintiffs to act on behalf of a larger group. That\u2019s just one of several built-in legal protections in cruise tickets meant to safeguard companies against a rash of litigation that\u2019s already arising from the coronavirus pandemic.\u201cThese claims are enormous \u2013 nothing the industry\u2019s seen before with so many passengers fallen sick and bringing suit,\u201d said Martin Davies, director of the Tulane Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School. Any judgments would be paid out of an insurance pool that the cruise lines have formed, Davies said.Currently, no cruise company faces more claims related to the virus than Carnival, the industry\u2019s largest operator. At least 22 lawsuits have been filed against Carnival-owned companies, seeking millions of dollars in damages. The company said it doesn\u2019t comment on active litigation.By comparison, Celebrity Cruises, owned by the second-largest company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., faces just one U.S. lawsuit so far: a proposed class-action filed by crew members who allege Celebrity failed to protect them from the virus. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., the third largest, faces a shareholder lawsuit that alleges the company failed to disclose adverse facts that affected it due to COVID-19. Lawyers say passenger suits against other cruise companies are probably coming.Some of the virus-related claims, including the Hernandezes\u2019 case, seek class-action status and involve multiple plaintiffs, totaling almost 200 so far.But suits seeking class-action certifications face an \u201cuphill battle,\u201d Davies said, because of language contained in the passengers\u2019 tickets. \u201cProvided that\u2019s what the contract says, generally the courts will find that enforceable.\u201dRange of ProtectionsIt\u2019s not uncommon for big businesses of all sorts to insist on class-action waivers in their contracts, but cruise operators have a range of other legal protections as well. Some of them stem from byzantine maritime laws that date to the 19th Century, when policy makers wanted to encourage investment in the shipping industry.\u201cIf you print out one of these tickets, it\u2019s like 20 pages of gobbledygook,\u201d said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. Hickey, who spent almost two decades defending cruise operators in court, now represents plaintiffs against them. \u201cMost people have no idea the limitations they\u2019re presented with.\u201dFor example, judgments for deaths that occur far from U.S. ports are limited by the Death on the High Seas Act, enacted in 1920. Most ticket contracts limit any legal actions to select federal courts, predominantly in Florida or Los Angeles, no matter where the customers live. And most of them require passengers to notify a cruise operator within six months that they intend to sue.In general, cruise industry representatives say it\u2019s unfair to single out cruise operators, who they say implemented more aggressive screening and prevention measures related to COVID-19 than other travel sectors did.Cruise lines \u201ctook immediate and aggressive action based on the information that was available when it was available every step of the way,\u201d said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for the Cruise Lines International Association. \u201cImportantly, all decisions were based upon the expertise and guidance of prevailing health authorities.\u201dThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 ordered cruise ships in U.S. waters to suspend operations after travellers on more than 30 voyages were infected with COVID-19.The Hernandezes\u2019 tickets for the Costa Luminosa contained a \u201cpatently unfair\u201d prohibition on class actions, said their lawyer, Michael Winkleman of Florida. He acknowledged \u201csignificant hurdles\u201d for their lawsuit, which alleges that the bar on class actions should be voided because Costa Cruise Lines acted \u201cintentionally by exposing passengers to a highly contagious virus\u201d for which there\u2019s no vaccine.If the case isn\u2019t certified as a class action, Winkleman said, he intends to file cases for the plaintiffs individually or in smaller groups. Class-action lawsuits, which can result in larger judgments or settlements, can help to move cases more swiftly for plaintiffs. Most plaintiffs\u2019 law firms that pursue them do so on a \u201cno win, no fee\u201d basis, banking on bigger payouts, said Davies, the maritime-law professor.Suits\u2019 Allegations\u201cThe ship never should have sailed,\u201d Emilio Hernandez, 51, said in an interview. \u201cThey put profit over the safety of passengers and crew.\u201dHe and his wife almost canceled their March 5 sailing on the Costa Luminosa to Antigua and Europe, but Costa assured them precautions would be taken, he said. Their lawsuit alleges that the operator proceeded with the trip despite knowing that at least one passenger from the ship\u2019s previous voyage, who disembarked Feb. 29, had coronavirus symptoms.That passenger left for a medical emergency that was \u201cnot even connected to any flu-like symptoms,\u201d said Rossella Carrara, a spokeswoman for the cruise operator\u2019s Italian parent company, Costa Crociere Group, which is also owned by Carnival.Sanitation procedures on the ship were stepped up ahead of the Hernandezes\u2019 cruise, Carrara said, and a quarantine of all passengers and other measures, such as daily temperature checks, were adopted after the company learned of positive test results.Costa has said previously that the company passed information to Costa Luminosa passengers as soon as it received it and that it suspended new cruises on March 13, the day it learned that a passenger on its cruise had tested positive.Many of the coronavirus lawsuits filed thus far argue that the companies should have known how infectious the pathogen was after an outbreak in late February on the Diamond Princess, which is operated by Carnival\u2019s Princess Cruise Lines Ltd. What began as fewer than a dozen infections quickly spread to more than 700 passengers and eventually killed at least 13 despite a quarantine of the vessel off Yokohama, Japan.Lawsuits filed by passengers of another Princess vessel, the Grand Princess, allege that the cruise line knew some people aboard had Covid-19 symptoms when the ship docked and boarded new passengers in San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii. The two symptomatic passengers disembarked that day; one tested positive shortly afterward and died, prompting California officials to refuse to let the ship dock.The Grand Princess suits, filed by lawyer Debi Chalik, claim that the cruise operator alerted passengers of the ship\u2019s previous cruise about potential Covid-19 exposure in a Feb. 25 email, but didn\u2019t warn passengers on its Hawaii cruise. Chalik\u2019s office said it\u2019s representing dozens of plaintiffs.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company\u2019s response to the Covid-19 outbreak \u201chas focused on the well-being of our guests and crew within the parameters dictated to us by the government agencies involved and the evolving medical understanding of this new illness.\u201d She said the company doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.On March 4, Carnival\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Grant Tarling, notified passengers and crew on the Grand Princess that the CDC was investigating a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage, according to the Princess website. It warned the 60 or so guests who also had sailed on that trip that they \u201cmay have been exposed.\u201d It was then \u2013 two weeks after the voyage began \u2013 that testing started, the suits allege.When the ship was finally permitted to dock, 21 people tested positive. All American travelers were quarantined on U.S. military bases.Carnival\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Arnold Donald, told Bloomberg Businessweek in an April 16 article that his company\u2019s response was reasonable under the circumstances. \u201cThis is a generational global event \u2014 it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said.Inspections QuestionedBefore the new coronavirus, the cruise industry had generally avoided large-scale litigation over infectious disease outbreaks at sea. Since 2006, there\u2019d been fewer than 10 lawsuits filed over norovirus, the notorious gastrointestinal ailment that for years has ruined some passengers\u2019 experiences.Yet many of the Covid-19 lawsuits raise questions about the inspections that U.S. officials instituted in response to norovirus outbreaks. Plaintiffs in the Grand Princess suits claim the cruise operator didn\u2019t adequately sanitize the vessel between voyages. And Winkleman, the Hernandezes\u2019 lawyer, said he plans to focus part of his cases on Carnival\u2019s record of ship inspections and history of outbreaks at sea.The Costa Luminosa and the Grand Princess both have unremarkable inspection records. Ships need an 86 or higher to pass under the CDC\u2019s Vessel Sanitation Program. The Costa Luminosa was last inspected on Jan. 5 and received a 94. The Grand Princess passed its last inspection in June with a 93.The program subjects ships that dock at U.S. ports to surprise inspections twice a year. Since 2016, ships owned by Carnival fail about 3% of their inspections. Norwegian Cruise Line has the worst failure rate at 4% and Royal Caribbean\u2019s rate is about 1%.Carnival spokesman Roger Frizzell noted that the company makes up about half the industry, and said its ships \u201ctypically perform extremely well\u201d during inspections. He said Carnival-owned ships have received the highest number of perfect scores as well.For now, with cruises canceled and the industry in a kind of suspended animation, the lawsuits and their claims represent a potential challenge that cruise operators haven\u2019t seen before, said Ross Klein, an associate dean at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada who has studied the cruise industry for more than two decades. \u201cThere are still a lot of ifs\u201d about the success of the legal claims, he said, but the risk for the companies is there.\u201cThe industry hasn\u2019t had any calamitous losses \u2013 nothing that would be potentially as large as this if the cases proceed in court,\u201d Klein said.\u00a0\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jen Skerritt and Shelly Hagan", "title": "Boneless chicken starts to vanish amid meatpacking plant shutdowns", "description": "The poultry industry is shifting away from de-boning to ramp up production", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/boneless-chicken-starts-to-vanish-in-u-s-meatpacking-shutdowns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/chicken-drumsticks.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 28, 2020 5:34 PM EDT", "content": "Goodbye, boneless chicken.Food retailers across North America are swapping boneless chicken legs for less popular thighs and drumsticks as a wave of shutdowns at meatpacking plants has reduced supplies of sought-after cuts.COVID-19 infections among workers at some of the largest meat processing plants in the U.S. and Canada have reduced slaughter capacity, and in some cases the types of cuts available. Outbreaks have shut down almost a third of U.S. pork capacity and the growing wave of disruptions has spurred plans by President Donald Trump to order meat-processing plants to remain open.

Companies are taking products that would have been used by the food service industry and redirecting it for retail sale. That means forgoing thin-cut meats that would require more time to process.Grocers are also trying to find a way to sell so-called \u201cend cuts\u201d from the leg or trunk that consumers may be unfamiliar with. That includes promoting the idea of grilling marinated round steaks \u2014 from the leg of a cow \u2014 on the barbecue to make it more tender, Young said.Larger PackagesConsumers in grocery stores around the world might notice larger packages of meat instead of individual steaks or smaller portions, said Brian Sikes, head of Cargill\u2019s protein and salt businesses. While the company\u2019s plants primarily produce the same products for retail and food-service, they might cut or package them slightly differently, he said.\u201cWe know they\u2019re buying cuts that they\u2019ve never bought before,\u201d Young said Wednesday by telephone.Even in Europe, where supply disruptions have not been as severe, grocers are trying to get retail customers to eat cuts of meat that restaurants usually buy. In the U.K., there\u2019s been an uptick in sales of steaks and other cuts of meat less popular with retail customers, according to Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors\u2019 Association. Big retailers have been putting these cuts on sale to encourage shoppers to buy, Allen said.

Nearby, televisions broadcast messages of thanks from employees and customers.So goes the new normal at the world\u2019s largest online retailer.\u00a0A\u00a0vital lifeline for Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon is trying to limit the disease\u2019s spread\u00a0within its workforce. At the same time, the company is waging a public-relations campaign to reassure the employees picking, packing and shipping products that it\u2019s safe to\u00a0show up even as some of their colleagues continue to get sick\u00a0and others complain about working conditions.A test of Amazon\u2019s progress arrives on Friday, when the company ends a pandemic perk of sorts that offered employees unlimited, unpaid time off \u2014 no questions asked. Amazon last week told employees who had stayed home that they would have to start reporting for work or seek a formal leave of absence beginning May 1. In a sense, Amazon\u2019s efforts echo what\u2019s happening at the state level, where some governors are trying to get people back to work without worsening the pandemic. \nA fight against Amazon becomes a state matter in Quebec\nBezos, Musk among billionaires gaining net worth in pandemic -report\nJeff Bezos wants regular, in-house testing of all Amazon employees for COVID-19\nAmazon hasn\u2019t said how many of its workers took\u00a0unpaid time off. But in interviews, dozens of employees at warehouses around the country suggest a significant portion of\u00a0their colleagues have stopped coming or dropped shifts. Those workers, many of whom rely on Amazon for health benefits, now face the choice of applying for an extended unpaid leave or testing Amazon\u2019s new safety procedures firsthand.\u00a0Employees who feel they can\u2019t return because they\u2019re looking after school-age children or have health problems, worry that they could be replaced by the tens of thousands of new people Amazon has hired in recent weeks.One worker at the Pennsylvania warehouse where the disinfecting team video plays on a loop said she stopped going to work briefly after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases there began late last month. She\u2019s since returned. \u201cI would have stayed home again if they didn\u2019t make the changes they have,\u201d she said. Still, the worker said that some of her colleagues remain skeptical and afraid.Amazon is \u201cproviding flexibility with leave-of-absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email. \u201cWe continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.\u201d The company said it doesn\u2019t plan to cut people once the unlimited leave expires.\n\nThe inside of an Amazon fulfilment centre in 2019.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters files\n\nThe coronavirus first struck Amazon\u2019s facilities in northern Italy in February. When cases began to spread across the U.S. in the following weeks, Amazon announced the offer of unpaid time off, as well as a temporary US$2-an-hour raise. While these measures were welcomed by many workers, they said the virus\u2019s spread and a sometimes haphazard rollout of social-distancing measures amplified a prevailing distrust of management in many warehouses.When cases were reported at a returns facility in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, last month, one employee said she expressed concerns to human resources that the company\u2019s cleaning measures were inadequate. The on-site manager referred questions to a corporate call centre, where an employee read a script back to her about enhanced cleaning. A follow-up note to the building\u2019s top manager wasn\u2019t returned. The woman, who said she was then bringing her own hand sanitizer to work, started taking unpaid time off. She has applied for COVID-19 leave to care for young children and hasn\u2019t heard back. Kentucky, which hasn\u2019t set a date for reopening schools or day-care centres, had one of its worst days for new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the same day Amazon announced the end of the unpaid time-off policy.Amazon has unquestionably made its warehouses safer, according to workers around the country. Metal detectors set up to deter theft have been turned off, since employees tend to bunch up waiting to go through. Cleaning supplies are more abundant; in places where it\u2019s still hard to find these products in local stores, bottles of disinfectant and hand sanitizer are tied to breakroom tables. Packaging stations have been spread out. When unloading trailers or lifting heavy items, two-person teams have been split up. And in hundreds of facilities, the company has hired contractors to spray the same disinfecting fog used by hospitals and airlines. Since March, employees have been able to bring cell phones onto the floor \u2014 ostensibly for emergency calls.Some workers once bristled when\u00a0admonished for bringing soft drinks to their workstations or clocking in a minute late after breaks; now they said they\u2019re\u00a0being lectured about proper face mask technique or passing someone too closely in a\u00a0hallway.\n\nA worker in a face mask walks by trucks parked at an Amazon facility on Long Island in New York.\n\nAndrew Kelly/Reuters files\n\nDespite the new safety measures, many workers have chosen to cut shifts short or take a spontaneous half-day, complicating Amazon\u2019s effort to ensure there are enough people to meet demand. As absenteeism reached 50 per cent in some warehouses, according to people briefed on attendance data, Amazon went on a hiring binge. On April 13, the company reached its goal of recruiting 100,000 people and said it was looking for an additional 75,000. Workers said those reinforcements are largely responsible for keeping operations going amid the pandemic. Amazon said the new hires have been brought on to meet increased demand.Employees at\u00a0warehouses in South Carolina and Michigan estimated temps and new hires outnumber veterans by 10 to 1 on some teams. \u201cWe have full shifts in all departments, but it\u2019s seasonal workers,\u201d said Jaylen Camp, who works at\u00a0a\u00a0facility in Romulus, Michigan, and earlier this month participated in a walkout calling for\u00a0the warehouse to be closed for cleaning. \u201cIt\u2019s all new people surrounding me daily,\u201d said another worker at a nearby facility, who, like most people who spoke for this story, requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from their employer.Sporadic protests continue at Amazon warehouses. The company has fired\u00a0employees involved in walkouts or organizing in New York and Minnesota for what it says are violations of corporate policy. Several politicians have accused Amazon of retribution, and this week\u00a0New York\u2019s attorney general announced an investigation into the firing of a Staten Island worker. The company has countered internal and external critics\u00a0with employee testimonials and a PR campaign. Workers who took unpaid time off have received emails listing cleaning practices and inviting them to return to work. Social-media sites have been blanketed with Amazon\u00a0advertisements thanking workers for their bravery and showing them wearing\u00a0protective gear.\u00a0Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, wearing a mask and trailed by a camera, swung through a Dallas-area warehouse.

A post shared by  Amazon (@amazon) on Apr 8, 2020 at 9:05pm PDTSome employees wonder how Amazon will safely accommodate returnees in buildings rearranged to separate workstations and keep people from congregating. Others said they will have a hard time returning because they have kids at home. The company said both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for COVID-19-related leave, either to care for children home from school, or because of health issues they or household members face. Those who want to avoid a penalty for missing shifts had to apply by Wednesday, Amazon told workers. (Amazon has promised two weeks of sick pay for employees who actually catch the disease).The rollout of the new leave policy has had some challenges. One part-time employee, who applied to take May off to avoid exposing elderly parents, was quickly denied by human resources, which told the person, incorrectly, that part-time employees weren\u2019t eligible. An Amazon spokeswoman later said the decision had been reversed.Other employees plan to return to work. One worker at a warehouse in Connecticut, who decided to work part-time as cases spread nearby, said she can\u2019t afford to lose the paycheque. \u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s just about sick people staying home, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids aren\u2019t in school.

It will affect many processing plants supplying beef, chicken, eggs and pork.Trump\u2019s order sets the stage for a showdown between America\u2019s meat giants, who\u2019ve been pressing to reopen plants hit by mass outbreaks, and local officials and labor unions who\u2019ve called for closures and are trying to prevent the virus from spreading. The president himself has long agitated for Americans to return to work and restore a U.S. economy crippled by social distancing measures.We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products \n \nThe White House decided to make the move amid estimates that as much as 80% of U.S. meat production capacity could shut down.

Trump has previously invoked the law \u2014 or threatened to invoke it \u2014 in order to increase the supply of medical gear including ventilators, masks and swabs to test for coronavirus infection.The White House has been discussing the order with meatpacking executives to determine what they need to operate safely and stay open, in order to prevent shortages, the person said. White House General Counsel Pat Cipollone worked with private companies to design a federal mandate to keep the plants open and to provide them additional virus testing capacity as well as protective gear.Trump acted one day after Iowa\u2019s two U.S. senators and its governor urged the administration to invoke the DPA to keep meatpackers open and reopen closed facilities \u201cas soon as it is possible to do so safely.\u201d Iowa produces one-third of the nation\u2019s pork supply, according to the state officials.The officials also asked for federal assistance in euthanizing pigs and reimbursing hog farmers for their losses due to closures of processing facilities.Sick WorkersAcross the country, at least 6,500 meat processing employees have been impacted by the virus, meaning they either tested positive for the disease or had to go into self-quarantine, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the largest private-sector union. Twenty workers have died.At least 22 meat plants have closed within the past two months, reducing pork processing capacity by 25 per cent and beef processing capacity by 10 per cent, according to UFCW. Farmers have animals with nowhere to go as a result, and the situation is so dire that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is setting up a centre to help growers with \u201cdepopulation and disposal methods\u201d for animals.Experts have warned the U.S. could be just weeks away from fresh meat shortages. While inventories can provide some cushion, stockpiles are limited.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.And the shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight.

The next chapter in the oil crisis is now inevitable: great swathes of the petroleum industry are about to start shutting down.The economic impact of the coronavirus has ripped through the oil industry in dramatic phases. First it destroyed demand as lockdowns shut factories and kept drivers at home. Then storage started filling up and traders resorted to ocean-going tankers to store crude in the hope of better prices ahead.Now shipping prices are surging to stratospheric levels as the industry runs out of tankers \u2014 a sign of just how distorted the market has become. \n\u2018Devastation on all fronts\u2019: For Canada\u2019s oil town, severe flood just one in a series of disasters\nNational Bank CEO blasts \u2018act of economic warfare\u2019 on North American energy industry\n\u2018Sacrosanct\u2019 dividends on the chopping block as analysts look past oil companies\u2019 Q1 earnings\nThe spectre of production shut-downs \u2014 and the impact they will have on jobs, companies, their banks, and local economies \u2014 was one of the reasons that spurred world leaders to join forces to cut production in an orderly way. But as the scale of the crisis dwarfed their efforts, failing to stop prices diving below zero last week, shut-downs are now a reality. It\u2019s the worst-case scenario for producers and refiners.\u201cWe are moving into the end-game,\u201d Torbjorn Tornqvist, head of commodity trading giant Gunvor Group Ltd., said in an interview. \u201cEarly-to-mid May could be the peak. We are weeks, not months, away from it.\u201dIn theory, the first oil output cuts should have come from the OPEC+ alliance, which earlier this month agreed to reduce production from May 1. Yet after the catastrophic price plunge on Monday, when West Texas Intermediate fell to -US$40 a barrel, it\u2019s the U.S. shale patch that is leading.We are moving into the end-gameTorbjorn Tornqvist \n \nThe best indicator of how the U.S. industry is reacting is the rapid drop in the number of oil rigs in operation, which last week fell to a four-year low. Before the coronavirus crisis hit, oil companies ran about 650 rigs in the U.S. By Friday, more than 40 per cent of them had stopped working, with only 378 left.\u201cMonday really focused people\u2019s minds that production needs to slow down,\u201d Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at commodity merchant Trafigura Group, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the smack in the face the market needed to realize this is serious.\u201dTrafigura, one of the largest exporters of U.S. crude from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, believes that output in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota and other states will now fall much faster than expected as companies react to negative prices, which have persisted for several days last week in the physical market.Until prices collapsed on Monday, the consensus was that output would drop by about 1.5m barrels a day by December. Now market watchers now see that loss by late June. \u201cThe severity of the price pressure is likely to act as a catalyst for the immediate turndown in activity and shut-ins,\u201d said Roger Diwan, oil analyst at consultant IHS Markit Ltd.The price shock has been particularly intense in the physical market: producers of crude streams such as South Texas Sour and Eastern Kansas Common had to pay more than US$50 a barrel to offload their output last week. ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources Inc. have all announced plans to shut in output. Regulators in Oklahoma voted to allow oil drillers to shut wells without losing leases; New Mexico made a similar decision.\n\nA warning placard on a tank car carrying crude oil near a loading terminal in Trenton, North Dakota.\n\nMatthew Brown/AP Photo files\n\nNorth Dakota, which for years was synonymous with the U.S. shale revolution, is witnessing a rapid retrenchment. Oil producers have already closed more than 6,000 wells, curtailing about 405,000 barrels a day in production, or about 30 per cent of the state\u2019s total.The output cuts won\u2019t be limited to the U.S. From Chad, a poor and landlocked country in Africa, to Vietnam and Brazil, producers are now either reducing output or making plans to do so.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get sensational about it but yes, clearly there must be a risk of shut-ins,\u201d Mitch Flegg, the head of North Sea oil company Serica Energy, said in an interview. \u201cIn certain parts of the world it is a real and present risk.\u201dIn emergency board meetings last week, oil companies small and large discussed an outlook that\u2019s the most somber any oil executive has ever witnessed. For the small firms, the next few weeks will be all about staying afloat. But even for the bigger ones, like Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, it\u2019s a challenge. Big Oil will offer an insight into the crisis when companies report earnings this week.Saudi Arabia, Russia and the rest of the OPEC+ alliance will join the output cuts on Friday, slashing their output by more than 20 per cent, or 9.7 million barrels a day. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company, is already trimming to reach the target. And Russian oil companies have announced exports of their flagship Urals crude would drop in May to a 10-year low.Even so, it may not be enough. Every week, 50 million barrels of crude are going into storage, enough to fuel Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. combined. At that rate, the world will run out of storage by June. What\u2019s not stored onshore, is stashed in tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said there were so many tankers at anchor off California that it was keeping an eye on the situation.\n\nOil tankers are seen anchored off the coast of Long Beach, California, after sunset on April 25, 2020.\n\nApu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBefore the crisis hit, the world was consuming about 100 million barrels a day. Demand now, however, is somewhere between 65 and 70 million barrels. So, in a worst-case scenario, about a third of global output needs to be shut.The reality is likely to be less severe as storage would continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand. Plus, oil traders say consumption has probably hit a bottom, and will start a very gentle recovery.Refiners ShutBut before that takes hold, the great shutdown will spread through oil refining too.Over the past week, Marathon Petroleum Corp., one of the biggest U.S. refiners, announced it would stop production at a plant near San Francisco. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has idled several units in three U.S. refineries in Alabama and Louisiana. And across Europe and Asia, many refineries are running at half rate. U.S. oil refiners processed just 12.45 million barrels a day on the week to April 17, the lowest amount in at least 30 years, except for hurricane-related closures.More refinery shutdowns are coming, oil traders and consultants said, particularly in the U.S. where lockdowns started later than in Europe and demand is still contracting. Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, said that global refineries could halt as much as 25 per cent of total capacity in May.\u201cNo one is going to be able to dodge this bullet.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michael Bellusci and Kevin Orland", "title": "Canada's big oil producers will start reporting earnings tomorrow.

The fund said it\u2019s moving its money to contracts spread between July 2020 and June 2021 due to new limits imposed upon it by regulators and its broker.As the U.S. Oil Fund sold its June position, the contract plunged more than 25 per cent, significantly widening the June-July spread, which has become a target for speculators. The fund appears to have come under heavy pressure from its broker, which it didn\u2019t name, disclosing that in the future it will hold \u201csignificant portions of its portfolio in cash beyond what it has historically held in order to satisfy potential margin requirements.\u201d \nBottom-calling bets on $4.3 billion energy ETF go bad amid oil plunge\nAll eyes on Cushing, Oklahoma as oil prices skid on fears that storage will soon reach full capacity\nBiggest oil ETF could go \u2018lights out,\u2019 warns Wall Street strategist\nThe ETF has changed its investment policy five times in the last two weeks. It also warned investors its valuation may deviate significantly from the underlying oil price, in effect acknowledging that it\u2019s momentarily less focused on the price of WTI crude.\u201cWhile it is USO\u2019s expectation that at some point in the future it will be able to return to primarily investing in the Benchmark Futures Contract or other similar futures contracts of the same tenor based on light, sweet crude oil, there can be no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur,\u201d it said in the filing, adding that USO investors \u201cshould expect that there will be continued deviations between the performance of USO\u2019s investments and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, and that USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract or meet its investment objective.\u201dEasy TargetThe US$3.6 billion exchange-traded fund, run by United States Commodity Funds LLC, will move its June position from Monday through April 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, each day roughly selling and buying one-third of its position. It also announced that it will move its contracts forward over a 10-day period beginning May 1, but didn\u2019t disclose which will be affected. Previously, the fund typically rolled the contracts over four days.In response to risk mitigation measures taken by its futures broker, the fund will invest approximately 30% of its portfolio in July contracts, 15 per cent in August, 15 per cent in September, 15 per cent in October, 15 per cent in December and 10 per cent in June 2021.The fund listed factors including \u201ca change in regulator accountability levels and position limits\u201d as part of its reasons for the shift. As a result it will now struggle to meet its own investment objectives, it said.The discount between June WTI and the contract for December deepened sharply after the filing, reaching as low as US$15.17 a barrel.The long-only oil fund has in recent weeks become a magnet for retail investors looking for a bottom to the historic price rout that\u2019s pushed oil futures in New York into negative territory for the first time in history. The knock-on effects have impacted retail investors everywhere. While USO was not holding the May contract when it plunged below zero, traders pointed to retail money as having caused large gyrations in the market.But USO has quickly become a rich target for speculators that are able to take advantage of the moves by trading ahead of it, thanks to its detailed regulatory disclosures. By offering a detailed calendar and the exact contracts that\u2019s selling and buying, it allows others to place financial bets ahead, profiting from time-spreads movements.On Friday, the fund disclosed for the first time that it was ordered by CME Group Inc. to make changes to its position.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo", "title": "OMERS to launch $750-million venture fund to back tech companies", "description": "OMERS is set to announce two investments in Canadian startups in the coming weeks", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/omers-to-launch-750-million-venture-fund-to-back-tech-companies", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/money-7.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 8:52 AM EDT", "content": "The Ontario Municipal Employment Retirement System is launching a venture capital fund to back early-stage technology companies in North America and Europe.The US$750-million fund is OMERS\u2019 first transatlantic venture vehicle, the Globe and Mail reported.

Nationwide shutdowns of all but essential stores during the pandemic have added further strain, with landlords facing lost rental income and tenant closures. Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "The shortlist for the next Bank of Canada governor is down to two names", "description": "The pressure is on for Finance Minister Bill Morneau to name a replacement to allow for a transitional period at a crucial time for the central bank", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/shortlist-for-next-bank-of-canada-governor-is-down-to-two-names", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bank-of-canada-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 27, 2020 6:38 AM EDT", "content": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s search for a successor to Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz is entering its final days with the government having already reduced the shortlist of candidates to two, according to people familiar with the matter.As Poloz prepares to step down on June 2, the pressure is on Trudeau\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, to name a replacement to allow for a transitional period at a time when the central bank is on the frontlines of fighting the economic fallout of the coronavirus.Poloz\u2019s top deputy, Carolyn Wilkins, who has played a central role in the central bank\u2019s response to the crisis, is one of the remaining contenders, according to the people, who spoke on condition they not be identified because the matter is confidential. While the second name has yet to emerge in public, BlackRock Inc.\u2019s Jean Boivin is no longer in contention. Tiff Macklem, dean of the University of Toronto\u2019s management school and a former central bank official, regularly features in speculation, though it\u2019s unclear whether he has sought the position. \nWhy Trudeau should put aside his personal agenda and ask Bank of Canada\u2019s Poloz to delay retirement\nClose ties between big banks and government get even closer during coronavirus crisis\nListen up: BofC deputy governor has an important, if arcane, topic on her mind as retirement looms\nWhoever gets the nod will inherit a tough assignment, one that\u2019s dramatically different even from when candidates were formally interviewed in February and early March. In an effort to stabilize an economy grappling with a pandemic and tumbling oil prices, Poloz has cut the benchmark interest rate to near zero, injected tens of billions in cash into the banking sector and started purchasing government debt.On the one hand, the Bank of Canada\u2019s role in the crisis is a secondary one, as monetary policy plays second fiddle to emergency government spending. On the other, the stakes have never been higher for the governor of a central bank that must fund an unprecedented level of government borrowing.The situation is fraught with risk for the next governor, as the central bank\u2019s deficit-financing role threatens to politicize the institution and erode its independence. The job will require some backbone.\n\nSenior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins listens to Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz at a news conference on May 16, 2019.\n\nChris Wattie/Reuters files\n\n\u201cYou need someone forceful,\u201d Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere does have to be some push back.\u201dThe outright government bond purchases are without precedent in Canada, but far from unique in today\u2019s world. All major central banks are doing it for the same reasons \u2014 the government debt needed to tackle the crisis is too large to be absorbed by the private sector.The Bank of Canada\u2019s government bond purchase program is still in its infancy. Much of the central bank\u2019s activity so far has been in shorter-term money market operations aimed at providing the financial system with liquidity on a temporary basis.Holdings of federal government debt rose by more $30 billion (US$21 billion) over the past three weeks, but that\u2019s expected to expand rapidly, given a budget deficit set to easily surpass $200 billion \u2014 a gap that\u2019s about 10 per cent of economic output.The central bank also plans to acquire provincial and corporate bonds, sending it deeper into politics and increasing its exposure to credit risk.You need someone forcefulMark Chandler \n \nWith the central bank still in the thick of its emergency response, Wilkins would offer the most continuity. Her leadership role in keeping financial markets functioning has given her an opportunity to build credibility with key players such as the heads of Canada\u2019s commercial banks, a group that has plenty of sway over who becomes governor.Perhaps more importantly, the crisis has allowed Wilkins, 56, to work closely with Morneau, whose ability to get along with the next governor will be key to the job. The growing importance of fiscal policy means one of the Bank of Canada\u2019s biggest challenges will be to find a way to deepen coordination with government without giving up control of monetary policy.Poloz has expressed optimism these extraordinary measures will eventually be scaled back. \u201cSomeday the tensions will ease back and we won\u2019t need as much liquidity in the markets in order to keep them functioning,\u201d the outgoing governor said at a March 27 press conference.But there are worries the Bank of Canada could face pressure to fund more and more spending, even after the emergency response. How easy will it be to turn off the taps just as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its debts. It\u2019s one thing for the central bank to finance income support measures, another for it to fund agendas.In the short term, it\u2019s all academic. With the economy in crisis and inflation nowhere in sight, keeping the taps open is the only option.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Marvin G.

Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out.And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging 60 per cent from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.Any way you cut it, the coronavirus has \u201ccompletely changed everything,\u201d said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor and senior director of the agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. \nFarmers markets go virtual as they find ways to stay afloat during pandemic\nFood rationing is the new unnerving reality for grocery shoppers once spoiled for choice\n\u2018Barely treading water\u2019: Delivery apps\u2019 high fees have restaurants seeing red\n\u201cPeople are more concerned about putting food on the table than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really changes the mindset of a consumer.\u201dSome of these trends could be here to stay, experts say. Now that some people have gone back to packaged foods, they may be surprised to see the quality improvements for these products and keep buying them even in the post-quarantine world. Cooking more at home might also continue well after the lockdowns end.\u2018Health Halo\u2019Avocados are one of the foods that have seen a surprising price surge in the last few weeks. When lockdown measures first went into effect, farmers in Mexico, the world\u2019s top producer, started slowing harvest activities, anticipating a demand drop-off.But it turns out avocado toast and guacamole are proving to be stay-at-home favourites. Demand has been much higher than the growers were expecting, and that\u2019s sent prices surging. A box of Hass avocados from the state of Michoacan, Mexico\u2019s biggest producer, cost about 480 pesos (US$19) on April 24, according to the government. That\u2019s up about 60 per cent from 300 in early March.Other produce items have been flying off grocery shelves. U.S. retail sales of citrus were a standout, gaining about 50 per cent from year-earlier levels in March, according to data from researcher IRI.\u201cThere is a general health-halo over all fresh produce items,\u201d said Roland Fumasi, analyst for RaboResearch, in Fresno California.\n\nA truck filled with oranges is seen during a harvest at a farm in Lake Wales, Florida, U.S., April 1, 2020.\n\nMarco Bello/Reuters files\n\nIt might be the vitamin C content in citrus that prompted the buying as consumers look to boost their immune systems. Orange juice, once a breakfast staple that had fallen out of favour because of its high sugar content, also got a boost. Futures traded in New York are up about 13 per cent since the end of February.In Asia, consumers are turning to traditional remedies to safeguard themselves from the virus, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. In Vietnam, people are eating more black garlic and Indonesians are stocking up on jamu, a traditional medicine made from natural ingredients.Comfort FoodsFor a lot of people, eating has become an escape from boredom and stress these days. Consumers are picking up items at the grocery store they had been shunning just a few months ago \u2014 packaged foods in particular have been given new life.\u201cTraditionally, food has a comforting role,\u201d Tan of Mintel said.Nestle SA, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company, is seeing very strong demand for essential food and drink items, Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said earlier this month. The company makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas and Maggi instant noodles.Conagra Brands Inc., which includes Duncan Hines, Chef Boyardee and Birds Eye in its portfolio, is seeing a lift across all the categories, Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said late last month.\n\nMore people are buying snack foods.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\u201cIt moved in waves, but everything is moving,\u201d he said.Snack consumption is also going up. That\u2019s partly because people are stuck at home, but also because they\u2019re spending more time doing activities that lend to munching, like binge-watching \u201cTiger King\u201d on Netflix.The case of South Korea is instructive for other markets, according to researcher Euromonitor International Ltd. Snack sales at a popular convenience store in the country were up 9% from a year earlier in the first part of March.Restaurant LossesEven with the huge spike for grocery store buying, the blow from the closure of restaurants is just too big to overcome in some markets. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been things like milk dumping. Farmers are being forced to dispose of excess supplies because demand from cheese and butter makers has dried up.Price moves illuminate that pain. Butter futures in Chicago have tumbled to the lowest in a decade, and cheese has also crashed.Belgium\u2019s storied pomme frite purveyors are another victim. The country is the world\u2019s top shipper of frozen potato products, hawking fries, crisps and mash to more than 160 countries, said Romain Cools, secretary general of industry group Belgapom. The vast majority is exported and demand dried up as the food-service industry grinds to a halt. European processing-potato futures are down almost 90 per cent this year, trading at an all-time low.Even if restaurants are still doing take-away orders, many have reduced their menu offerings while home cooks in general are not using as many ingredients as they might eat at a sit-down meal.But consumers will also be pleased to see that US$20 goes a lot more at the grocery store than it does at a fine-dining or quick-serve restaurant, said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer goods senior analyst at RaboResearch in New York. And the revival of packaged foods might have some longer-term impacts on buying habits.\u201cThere\u2019s a simplification going on,\u201d Fereday said. Packaged foods are \u201ccertainly more available because there\u2019s more output, and people will remember that.

Reckoning that weeks of confinement will permanently accelerate the growth of online shopping, Premier Francois Legault wants to boost Quebec retailers\u2019 digital sales, and is urging the population of 8.5 million to buy from local firms.His government took a first step by building an online directory of retailers called Le Panier Bleu \u2014 or Blue Basket, a reference to the colour of the French-speaking province\u2019s flag. To run it, the government recruited a board including the former president of Lowe\u2019s Cos.

The province has a number of sizable homegrown retailers, such as Simons department stores, and has produced a few international players.Amazon is fighting stronger opponents in other countries, including France, where last week it lost a court fight to sell the whole range of its products. France has restricted the company\u2019s deliveries to food, health items and computer products to protect workers from the coronavirus.Wealth GapThe track record of Canadian-made alternatives to Amazon is not good. One of most famous failures was a site called Shop.ca, backed by several big names in business and former hockey star Eric Lindros. It flopped and wound up in bankruptcy court in 2016.Few Quebec companies are known for their online retailing success. According to a survey by CEFRIO, a digital research and innovation group backed by the government, more than a third of Quebec adults make at least one purchase per month on Amazon. Yet in another report published in 2018, only 14 per cent of the Quebec firms surveyed said they sold products online.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a greater mobilization potential in Quebec than in the rest of Canada because of nationalism,\u201d Lecours said. \u201cStill, let\u2019s be honest, Quebecers too shop at Costco and Walmart, because it\u2019s cheaper. If a Quebec purchase is 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent more expensive, at what point do they give up?\u201dEfforts to drive money from national sentiment were already in underway before the Blue Basket launch \u2014 including an online store called Ma Zone Quebec, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Amazon. Local media also joined in, suggesting Quebec substitutes for groceries such as Kraft Heinz Co.\u2019s barbecue sauce or Heineken NV\u2019s beer.\n\nQuebec Premier Francois Legault.\n\nJacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press\n\nWhen Legault and Fitzgibbon unveiled the Blue Basket during an April 5 press conference, they described it as a non-for-profit organization that aims to make both merchants and Quebec richer \u2014 an overarching goal for the premier, who often says he wants to close the wealth gap with other provinces.\u201cAn initiative to promote local commerce isn\u2019t an initiative against free trade,\u201d Fitzgibbon said then. \u201cIt\u2019s a unified communication approach to enable our small retailers to do well against companies that have huge marketing resources.\u201dThe Blue Basket website, put together in two weeks, doesn\u2019t do transactions yet and was derided by critics for being too basic. The team running it says it\u2019s in its early stages and will become more sophisticated. About 13,000 businesses were referenced as of April 24.Andree-Anne Julien, who runs online bedding and decoration store Espace Deco + Idees Cadeaux, said being listed initially drove more than 1,000 Blue Basket visitors to her site, giving an additional boost to a business that has thrived since brick-and-mortar competitors were forced to close a month ago. The flow has reduced to a trickle since, though she still credits the government for the effort and expects the \u201cBuy Quebec\u201d movement to stay.\u201cNo one can compete with Amazon,\u201d she said. Yet because her Quebec suppliers don\u2019t sell on the behemoth\u2019s platform, \u201cwe have some exclusivity they don\u2019t have.\u201d\u2018I Made No Money\u2019Online shopping has been slowly taking off in Canada and accounted for 6.8 per cent of retail sales last year, compared with 11 per cent in the U.S., according to researcher eMarketer.The pandemic may accelerate the conversion. In a Deloitte survey conducted March 16-18, early on in the crisis, about half of Canadians said they were more likely to buy online. This month, Shopify Inc.\u2019s chief technology officer tweeted that the e-commerce software company is handling \u201cBlack Friday level traffic every day\u201d to bring thousands of businesses online.Logistics are a major hurdle to Legault\u2019s plans. Louis Corriveau, who specializes in work and hunting clothes on his e-commerce site CoriBouTik, said that even though he will register on Blue Basket, shipping costs in a vast country are a problem for small businesses like his. He recently sold a cap for $12 (US$8.50) that cost $14 to mail to a remote region of Quebec. He charged his client $8.75 in shipping fees to make it palatable.\u201cI made no money,\u201d he said. Shipping costs \u201cis what\u2019s hurting everyone.\u201dTaillefer, the entrepreneur on Blue Basket\u2019s board, has been mulling solutions for retailers to lower their operating costs, mostly by combining forces on warehousing or delivery to save money. For now, the focus is on getting shoppers\u2019 attention.\u201cOur goal is to shift some of the searches Quebeckers do on Amazon or Google to a search engine presenting essentially 100 per cent Quebec content,\u201d he said during a webcast of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal. If just 1 per cent get diverted, \u201cit will have been worth it.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michael Hirtzer and Tatiana Freitas", "title": "America could be weeks from meat shortages with shutdowns spreading", "description": "Plant shutdowns in U.S., Canada and Brazil, which produce 65% of world meat trade, threaten supply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/meat-supply-threats-grow-with-first-brazil-shutdown-u-s-turkey-halt?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/meat-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 24, 2020 2:58 PM EDT", "content": "Plant shutdowns are leaving the U.S. dangerously close to meat shortages as coronavirus outbreaks spread to suppliers across the nation and the Americas.Almost a third of U.S. pork capacity is down, the first big poultry plants closed on Friday and experts are warning that domestic shortages are just weeks away. Brazil, the world\u2019s No. 1 shipper of chicken and beef, saw its first major closure with the halt of a poultry plant owned by JBS SA, the world\u2019s biggest meat company. Key operations are also down in Canada, the latest being a British Columbia poultry plant.While hundreds of plants in the Americas are still running, the staggering acceleration of supply disruptions is now raising questions over global shortfalls. Taken together, the U.S., Brazil and Canada account for about 65 per cent of world meat trade.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unprecedented,\u201d said Brett Stuart, president of Denver-based consulting firm Global AgriTrends. \u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose situation where we have producers at the risk of losing everything and consumers at the risk of paying higher prices. Restaurants in a week could be out of fresh ground beef.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDemonstrators stand outside the closed Smithfield Foods pork plant, the world\u2019s biggest pork processor, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on April 17 after it was closed indefinitely due to a rash of coronavirus cases among employees.\n\nReuters/Shannon Stapleton\n\nNew U.S. shutdowns are hitting at a dizzying rate. Smithfield Foods Inc., the world\u2019s No. 1 pork producer, said Friday it was closing another operation, this one in Illinois. That news hit less than an hour after Hormel Foods Corp. said it was idling two of its Jennie-O turkey plants in Minnesota. JBS said Sunday it will shutter a beef production facility in Wisconsin. \nChicken farmers to shrink national flock by 12% as coronavirus takes toll on Canada\u2019s food supply chain\n'Family farms will be lost': Hog farmers fear bankruptcies, pork shortage as meat-packing plants close\nShockproofing Canada: Empty grocer shelves don\u2019t signal food security issues, but there are challenges looming\nThe most-recent news added to a flurry of other halts announced in the space of just a few weeks.\u201cDuring this pandemic, our entire industry is faced with an impossible choice: continue to operate to sustain our nation\u2019s food supply or shutter in an attempt to entirely insulate our employees from risk,\u201d Smithfield said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful choice; it\u2019s not one we wish on anyone.\u201dPrices are surging. U.S. wholesale beef touched a record in the week ended April 24, and wholesale pork soared 29 per cent, the biggest weekly gain since 2012.Jersey Mike\u2019s Franchise Systems Inc., which has 1,750 stores across the U.S., is working with its ham supplier Clemens Food Group to ensure its supply of pork, something they sell quite a bit of in their sub sandwiches.\u201cWe\u2019re backing it up already because of the coming \u2014 we feel \u2014 the coming shortages,\u201d said Peter Cancro, chief executive officer.To be sure, some plants have restarted after testing workers and improving conditions, and most Brazilian facilities are still operating. Another point to consider: There haven\u2019t yet been big shutdowns in Europe. The European Union accounts for about a fifth of global meat exports, U.S. government data show.Still, executives from Tyson Foods Inc., JBS and Smithfield have all warned that consumers are likely to see impact at the grocery store.It should be noted that the output from a plant where infection pops up doesn\u2019t pose health concerns because by all accounts COVID-19 isn\u2019t a food-borne illness. Products from a farm or a production plant with a confirmed case can still be sent out for distribution. But a production halt means that there\u2019s no new supplies.And these shutdowns are happening at a time when global meat supplies were already tight. China, the world\u2019s top hog producer, has been battling an outbreak of African Swine Fever, which destroyed millions of the country\u2019s pigs. Plus the virus is hitting production after some meat companies had already taken steps to slow output because of the closure of restaurants around the world.Inventories can provide some cushion, though they may not last long.Total American meat supplies in cold-storage facilities are equal to roughly two weeks of production. With most plant shutdowns lasting about 14 days for safety reasons, that further underscores the potential for deficits.Meanwhile, with slaughterhouses closing, farmers don\u2019t have a place to sell their animals. That\u2019s forcing some livestock producers to dispose of them. Plants are also facing a labour crunch as employees fall ill. It\u2019s been reported that a large chicken-processing company was forced to kill 2 million of its birds earlier this month because of worker shortages.That\u2019s the latest cruel blow to supply chains, with food being wasted en masse at the same time that grocery store shelves are running empty.The situation for U.S. farms is so severe that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is setting up a center to help identify potential alternative markets and assist on \u201cdepopulation and disposal methods.\u201d\n\nFamily members of JBS USA meat packing plant employee Saul Sanchez attend his funeral on after he died of coronavirus disease in Greeley, Colorado, April 15, 2020.\n\nReuters/Jim Urquhart\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly why the virus is spreading so fast among meat-plant employees. Some analysts have cited the fact that these are usually low-paying jobs that are often filled by immigrants and migrants. That means workers can live in cramped quarters, with sometimes more than one family sharing the same dwelling \u2014 so if one person gets sick, the disease can spread quickly.Employees are also in close proximity on the job, with the work on some processing lines being described as \u201celbow-to-elbow.\u201d Even if line speeds are slowed, workers spread out and shifts are staggered, there\u2019s still the chance of mingling in break rooms and hallways. These plants see thousands of people coming in and out every day \u2014 it\u2019s basically the opposite of social distancing.Sick InspectorsAt the same time, U.S. federal employees responsible for inspecting meat plants are falling ill. More than 100 inspection-service employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the government confirmed. At least two deaths of inspectors have been reported.U.S. inspectors travel among facilities. That\u2019s adding to fears that shutdowns will keep occurring if a sick federal employee brings the infection to plants where there\u2019s not yet an outbreak.In Brazil, JBS\u2019s Passo Fundo poultry plant in Rio Grande do Sul state was ordered to close, according to Priscila Schvarcz, a labour prosecutor in the municipality. There have been about 48 cases among employees, with 27 positive tests and others confirmed through epidemiological criteria, according to the latest data from Passo Fundo and neighbouring municipalities.JBS said measures implemented at the plant \u201care fully supported by reports and technical recommendations from health agencies and medical specialists.\u201d The company said it trusts operations would resume shortly and that \u201cemployee protection has always been the first JBS goal since the pandemic started.\u201dThe closure comes amid a jump in COVID-19 cases in Brazil.\u201cBrazilian meat companies have been taking a lot of preventative measures, but we don\u2019t see progress in agglomeration of people,\u201d said Jose Modelski Junior, a spokesperson for Contac, which represents food-industry workers. \u201cThey are not willing to change the number of workers in the same shift, and we are worried about that.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esteban Duarte", "title": "Canada's AAA credit rating on the line as oil crash slams debt-loaded provinces", "description": "Provinces are likely to need more assistance from the federal government \u2014 which could trigger a downgrade", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-aaa-on-the-line-as-oil-crash-hits-debt-loaded-provinces?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canada-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 11:53 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s stellar credit rating is being put to the test as the oil crash and recession expose the country\u2019s weak link: its provinces.Among the Group of Seven countries, only Germany and Canada have AAA ratings from S&P Global Ratings. But as pressure rises on the government of Justin Trudeau to aid provinces and key industries, Canada\u2019s fiscal position is looking shakier.Going into the COVID-19 crisis, Canada\u2019s provincial governments had $853 billion (US$602 billion) of debt securities outstanding, more than the national government. They also shoulder most of the cost for health care and eduction. Several of them rely on energy revenues that are evaporating. Oil-rich Alberta released a budget in February based on West Texas Intermediate prices of US$58 a barrel. Its deficit projections crumbled within days. \nShockproofing Canada: Here\u2019s what it will take to reopen the economy\nAlberta\u2019s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility\nHow to help the provinces weather the COVID-19 economic shock\nLast week the Bank of Canada expanded its asset purchase program to include as much as $50 billion in provincial debt to bring down yields. That may not be enough: Trudeau will likely have to come up with new fiscal measures too.\u201cThere is a very good chance that the need for more massive federal assistance for the provinces, for households, for the business sector, will trigger a downgrade at some point\u201d for Canada, said David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and Associates and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co.A \u2018Weak\u2019 AAACanadian governments will have net borrowing needs of 11.8 per cent of GDP this year, higher than all G7 countries except the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.Pricing on credit default swaps suggests traders see Canada\u2019s profile as similar to Australia \u2014 whose top credit rating was put on negative outlook by S&P on April 7 \u2014 and lower-rated New Zealand. Canada\u2019s economy is set to contract by 5.3 per cent in 2020, compared with 2.4 per cent decline globally, S&P said in an April 20 note.The federal and provincial governments have put together a virus response package of at least $315 billion, S&P said.\u201cThe fact that the Bank of Canada is now buying provincial debt, and that will help keep borrowing costs low \u2014 I think that will be very important for the credit rating,\u201d said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co. She sees the Canada\u2019s top credit rating as \u201cextremely resilient,\u201d citing the central government\u2019s relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio, which was a little more than 30 per cent before the crisis.Fitch Ratings, which is in the process of updating its projections for Canada as well as other sovereigns, looks at gross consolidated general government debt rather than federal debt in its models, said Kelli Bissett-Tom, a director of Americas sovereign ratings. By that yardstick Canada is \u201camong the weak\u201d AAA-rated sovereigns, she said, though it isn\u2019t an automatic trigger for a credit action.Implicit SupportWhile the federal government doesn\u2019t explicitly guarantee the debt issued by provinces, credit-rating companies and investors assume a high probability of support.For instance, Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s rating of A1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service would be two levels lower if not for the assumption of \u201ca high level of extraordinary support from the government of Canada,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in an April 1 statement. Moody\u2019s put the province on negative outlook, citing the decline of oil prices. It\u2019s the most indebted province, with debt at about 2.5 times revenues for the fiscal year that ended March 31.Newfoundland and some other provinces, including Manitoba, want the Trudeau government to set up an emergency credit agency to help them borrow more cheaply. They also want changes to the fiscal stabilization program, a federal mechanism created in the 1960s to help provinces facing revenue drops.\u201cWe still believe the proposal for an emergency fund has merit, and we will continue to work with our provincial counterparts and the federal government on solutions to the challenges we collectively face,\u201d said Newfoundland Finance Minister Tom Osborne.Alberta continues to press for a package of between $20 billion and $30 billion to help oil and gas companies stay afloat, Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said.\u201cOil and gas is the largest subsector of the Canadian economy and we have advocated to the federal government that the liquidity package needs to be significant,\u201d said Toews in an emailed statement.Provincial debt issuance for this year may reach $150 billion compared with about $100 billion estimated before the COVID-19 outbreak, Bank of Nova Scotia analysts including Rebekah Young wrote in an April 15 note. That\u2019s on top of federal financing needs of about $450 billion.\u201cProvincials are absolutely key for Canada\u2019s rating, because provincial debt in Canada collectively makes up the largest sub-sovereign debt issuance in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Gorewicz, portfolio manager at CI Investments. Some of the provinces\u2019 credit ratings may be \u201ccalled into question.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Mark Gurman, Debby Wu and Ian King", "title": "Apple aims to sell Macs with its own chips starting in 2021", "description": "The initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/apple-aims-to-sell-macs-with-its-own-chips-starting-in-2021", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/apple-mac.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 7:01 AM EDT", "content": "Apple Inc. is planning to start selling Mac computers with its own main processors by next year, relying on designs that helped popularize the iPhone and iPad, according to people familiar with the matter.The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.Apple is preparing to release at least one Mac with its own chip next year, according to the people. But the initiative to develop multiple chips, codenamed Kalamata, suggests the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple\u2019s partner for iPhone and iPad processors, will build the new Mac chips, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private product plans. The components will be based on a 5-nanometer production technique, the same size Apple will use in the next iPhones and iPad Pros, one of the people said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, as did Intel and TSMC.Apple is designing more of its own chips to gain greater control over the performance of its devices and differentiate them from rivals. Getting Macs, iPhones and iPads running the same underlying technology should make it easier for Apple to unify its apps ecosystem and update its computers more often. The move would also reduce reliance on Intel, which has struggled to maintain the annual increases in performance it once offered.Current mobile device chips from Apple have multiple processing units, or cores, that handle different types of tasks. The latest iPad Pro has four cores for performance-intensive workloads and another four to handle low-power tasks to preserve battery life.The first Mac processors will have eight high-performance cores, codenamed Firestorm, and at least four energy-efficient cores, known internally as Icestorm. Apple is exploring Mac processors with more than 12 cores for further in the future, the people said.In some Macs, Apple\u2019s designs will double or quadruple the number of cores that Intel provides. The current entry-level MacBook Air has two cores, for example.Like Qualcomm Inc. and the rest of the mobile semiconductor industry, Apple designs its smartphone chips with technology from Arm Inc., owned by SoftBank Group Corp. These components often use less energy than Intel\u2019s offerings. But it in recent years, Arm customers have tried to make processors that are also more powerful.The transition to in-house Apple processor designs would likely begin with a new laptop because the company\u2019s first custom Mac chips won\u2019t be able to rival the performance Intel provides for high-end MacBook Pros, iMacs and the Mac Pro desktop computer.The switch away from Intel is complex, requiring close collaboration between Apple\u2019s software, hardware and component-sourcing teams. Given work-from-home orders and disruptions in the company\u2019s Asia-based supply chain, the shift could be delayed, the people said.Like with the iPhone, Apple\u2019s Mac processors will include several components, including the main processor, known as a Central Processing Unit or CPU, and the GPU, the graphics chip. Apple\u2019s lower-end computers currently use Intel for graphics, while it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for the graphics cards in its professional-focused offerings.The Kalamata project has been going for several years. In 2018, Apple developed a Mac chip based on the iPad Pro\u2019s A12X processor for internal testing. That gave the company\u2019s engineers confidence they could begin replacing Intel in Macs as early as 2020, Bloomberg News reported.Apple has already started designing a second generation of Mac processors that follows the architecture of chips planned for the 2021 iPhone. That indicates Apple wants to put its Macs, iPhones and iPads on the same processor development cycle.Despite a unified chip design, Macs will still run the macOS operating system, rather than the iOS software of the iPhone and iPad. Apple is exploring tools that will ensure apps developed for older Intel-based Macs still work on the new machines. The company also has technology called Catalyst that lets software developers build an iPad app and run it on Mac computers.Moving macOS from Intel\u2019s chip architecture to an Arm-based design will be a technical challenge. Microsoft Corp. stumbled with a similar effort.The changes will be a blow to Intel\u2019s prestige. Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs and the late Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini stood on stage in 2005 to announce the first Macs with Intel processors. The decision was praised for several years, resulting in capable computers such as the original Mac Pro in 2006, the second-generation MacBook Air in 2010 and the thinner MacBook Pro in 2012.But in recent years, the pace of Mac upgrades has declined, partly due to a slowdown in Intel\u2019s chip advancements. That sometimes left years between Mac refreshes, upsetting some customers. Intel has also faced manufacturing challenges that Apple has blamed for some recent declines in Mac sales.Kalamata is Apple\u2019s most ambitious computer chip initiative to date. It currently offers specific chips for Mac features, such as security and power management, that work alongside the main Intel processors.Apple also aims to stop using Intel cellular modems \u2014 chips that connect smartphones to the internet and support calls \u2014 after using them for only four years. The company plans to use 5G modems from Qualcomm in as many as four new iPhone models later this year. Apple last year acquired Intel\u2019s modem business after striking the short-term supply deal with Qualcomm.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Chiglinsky", "title": "Warren Buffett stays silent as even his \u2018fortress\u2019 is breached by coronavirus shutdowns", "description": "\u2018We've got a few businesses, small ones, we won't reopen when this is over\u2019 \u2014 Charlie Munger", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/warren-buffetts-fortress-is-breached-by-coronavirus-related-shutdowns", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/warren-buffett-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 23, 2020 5:27 AM EDT", "content": "Even as market watchers await Warren Buffett\u2019s splashy move to seize on fallout from the current crisis, his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. hasn\u2019t been spared by the pandemic.Coronavirus-related shutdowns across the U.S. have hit Berkshire units from See\u2019s Candies and a shoemaker to industrial behemoth Precision Castparts. That could leave a few scars on the conglomerate that gives the billionaire investor his ammo and has been pumping out more than US$20 billion in annual profit in recent years.Buffett\u2019s business partner, Charlie Munger, put it bluntly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few businesses, small ones, we won\u2019t reopen when this is over,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal, without naming the units.As Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, Buffett has spent more than five decades crafting a behemoth with businesses in industries including insurance, energy and retail. That diversity helped the company weather the credit crisis in 2008, allowing its iconic leader to invest vast sums into other struggling companies.Buffett has stayed relatively quiet amid the turmoil this time around as the pandemic underscores just how tied his businesses are to the U.S. economy, which is getting hit on all sides by the virus and its ripple effects.\u201cThere\u2019s no fortress that\u2019s immune to that right now,\u201d said Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University Law School and co-author of the book \u201cMargin of Trust: The Berkshire Business Model.\u201dSome Berkshire operations are already feeling the pain. See\u2019s, which makes the treats that Buffett and Munger famously munch on during their annual shareholder meetings, announced a furlough of its retail workers in early April, and is now testing whether it can reopen some shops. Shoe seller Justin Brands shut outlets throughout Missouri. Berkshire\u2019s BNSF is expected to report that rail traffic declined during the first quarter, according to data from the Association of American Railroads and Bloomberg Intelligence.Industrial operations took a hit, too. Precision Castparts, acquired in 2016, manufactures components for the aerospace and power generation industries. The company said earlier in April that it would temporarily halt operations at a plant in Portland, Oregon, as customers reduced orders.To be sure, Buffett\u2019s promise that Berkshire will \u201cforever remain a financial fortress\u201d hasn\u2019t been broken yet. The company reported a US$128 billion cash pile at the end of last year, as well as a stock portfolio valued at more than US$248 billion.Some of its biggest revenue generators remain on solid footing. Auto insurer Geico said that shelter-in-place policies across the U.S. have reduced miles driven, which can translate into fewer accidents. And sprawling operations including the energy companies and heavy manufacturers are on the job.At chemical maker Lubrizol, the pandemic has forced a pivot familiar to countless businesses. CEO Eric Schnur said social distancing and work-from-home measures are now common at a company that began dealing with the effects of coronavirus months ago at operations in Asia, and is accustomed to rigid safety standards because of the dangerous chemicals that are part of its work.\u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near business as usual, of course,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut keeping people safe in a potentially unsafe situation is something we think about every day whether or not there\u2019s a coronavirus pandemic.\u201dSchnur said he and other Berkshire unit chiefs benefit from a decentralized model allowing managers to operate with a degree of autonomy in good times and bad. That type of model allows executives with the deepest knowledge of a business to be the ones who implement strategies, according to Cunningham. Still, Schnur said he\u2019s able to tap the expertise of Greg Abel, the vice chairman for non-insurance operations, if needed.Lubrizol, which hasn\u2019t cut workers in the crisis, is ramping up production of an ingredient used in making hand sanitizers and prioritizing products needed for the manufacture of medical devices. The company announced Monday that it was donating materials necessary to create personal protective equipment, aiding Nike Inc.\u2019s efforts to donate gear for health-care workers.Apart from Berkshire\u2019s day-to-day operations, investors are left wondering what Buffett\u2019s been up to. During the recent bull market, Berkshire underperformed the S&P 500 Index as Buffett struggled to find large companies to buy. Now, valuations have plummeted, creating an opening not seen in more than a decade.Munger said that he and Buffett are being careful. Companies aren\u2019t begging Berkshire for capital because most people are frozen as they try to figure out how to navigate this \u201ctyphoon,\u201d Munger told the Wall Street Journal.Berkshire\u2019s earnings, set to be released in May, will shed some light on Buffett\u2019s moves. Even in a quarter quiet on the front for major acquisitions, the results could indicate whether Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, had an appetite for shares in public companies during the market downturn.Part of Buffett\u2019s success during the financial crisis came from the lucrative preferred-stock and warrant deals he made with companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

But the measures weren\u2019t announced immediately after the closure of non-essential businesses, and the rent and wage subsidy programs aren\u2019t yet putting money in the bank. The government said it will open applications for the wage subsidy on Monday.Relief on rent and wages may not come soon enough, forcing layoffs and requiring more Canadians to lean on the government\u2019s income support program, according to Don Drummond, former chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank and a fellow at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario.\u201cThe bulk of the support may have to be handled by the emergency relief program and that\u2019s definitely second-best because that breaks the employer-employee relationship,\u201d Drummond said Wednesday in a television interview with BNN Bloomberg.Take \u2018Months\u2019Almost 7 million Canadians, or about a third of the labour force, have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which provides those who have lost work from COVID-19 with $2,000 (US$1,409) a month.Many companies let employees go before the wage subsidy was announced, so it will be harder for them to find workers again once the recovery starts, Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us months to put everybody back together as we come out of this.\u201dAnd if businesses do re-open in the near future, Kelly worries some CERB recipients may opt to continue receiving federal money instead of returning to work.Companies should keep employees on payrolls, or bring previously laid-off workers back, according to Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost employers anything to keep employees on the payroll instead of laying them off, so they need to be bringing people back,\u201d Yussuff said. \u201cThis is a very difficult time so workers don\u2019t need to have the added stress of looking for a job when this is all over.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "James Tarmy", "title": "Bored rich people are wearing big diamonds at home, buying pricy jewels to spark joy amid pandemic", "description": "The wealthy are spending lockdown buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/bored-rich-people-are-wearing-big-diamonds-at-home-buying-pricy-jewels-to-spark-joy-amid-pandemic", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sothebys.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 12:51 PM EDT", "content": "Catharine Becket, a specialist at Sotheby\u2019s in charge of its \u201cmagnificent jewels\u201d sale in New York, had been working on obtaining a specific 1930s diamond and enamel bracelet by Cartier for five years. \u201cWe\u2019d always hoped it might come to auction,\u201d she says, \u201cand it was just this winter that I spoke to the client, and she decided it was time to sell.\u201d The bracelet, known as a \u201cTutti Frutti\u201d for its multicoloured, Mughal-cut stones, is one of the most recognizable designs Cartier ever made, and several bracelets of the same style and from the same period have sold for millions of dollars.Becket\u2019s client had inherited the bracelet years ago, and she\u2019d worn it \u201cI think\u00a0once,\u201d Becket says. After some discussion, the client agreed to put the piece of jewelry\u00a0up for auction at the\u00a0major spring sale at Sotheby\u2019s New York, which was supposed to be held in late April.And then the coronavirus pandemic hit. \nJeff Bezos added $24 billion to his fortune so far this pandemic as world\u2019s rich reap bailout rewards\nCoronavirus skeptic Elon Musk donates over 1,000 ventilators to California\nWealth wipeout from market meltdown reshapes ranks of world\u2019s richest people\nLive auctions were called off, and Sotheby\u2019s pivoted to online sales. With global economies faltering, U.S. equity markets whipsawing, and people stuck at home indefinitely, the success of online jewelry sales was far from certain. Becket called the bracelet\u2019s owner\u00a0\u201cand told her that we would evaluate if it should be put in an online sale\u00a0or deferred to a live auction at a later date.\u201dBut to Becket\u2019s astonishment, collectible jewelry sales started to do well \u2014 very well. Speaking to her wealthy clients, she discovered they were buying jewels as a sort of pick-me-up. \u201cClients are sequestering at home and, generally speaking, leading relatively dreary lives,\u201d she says. Some, Becket adds, told her \u201cthey\u2019re wearing their big diamonds inside their homes because it brings joy.\u201dEveryone, she says, \u201cis waiting for this to be over, and I suppose knowing that a million-dollar piece of jewelry is waiting for you is a fulfillment of when things return to the new normal.\u201dThe results speak for themselves. Since the beginning of March, Sotheby\u2019s has run four online sales. Of them, 92 per cent of every lot sold, and 61 per cent of the lots exceeded their high estimates. In total, the sales brought in US$6.1 million, above the high estimate of US$5.7 million.\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that anything of good quality is performing well,\u201d Becket says, \u201cand actually better than it would have just a couple of months ago.\u201d A 1930s-era diamond ring that carried a high estimate of \u00a390,000 (US$110,000) sold for \u00a3162,000; a yellow-diamond ring that carried a high estimate of HK$1.6 million (US$206,000) sold for HK$2 million; a pair of emerald and diamond earrings from Graff sold for \u00a350,000, above a high estimate of \u00a332,000.Given the strength of these sales, Becket decided that \u201cI could call the client with complete confidence and say to her that I thought we\u2019d do a great job [selling the Tutti Frutti bracelet] online.\u201d The bracelet will be offered in a standalone sale, with online bidding open from April 24 to April 28. The estimate is US$600,000 to US$800,000.Investment PotentialThe rise in online collectible jewelry sales comes at a time when the price of raw diamonds has sunk precipitously. Prices at industry auctions for rough diamonds have sunk from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, according to an April 7 release from the Rapaport Research Report, and demand for polished diamonds has also plummeted.\u201cPolished exports from India fell 41 per cent year on year in February,\u201d Rapaport wrote, while \u201cshipments from Belgium dropped 38 per cent, and Israel\u2019s plummeted by 73 per cent.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cinventory rose among diamond manufacturers and dealers, with new supply becoming available while demand stayed frozen. We estimate that midstream inventory increased 20 per cent from the beginning of the year to mid-March.\u201dIf buyers are looking for an alternative asset to place their cash, in other words, diamonds, at least for the moment, are not an obvious safe haven.\u201cI don\u2019t think people were buying for the sake of investment,\u201d Becket says. \u201cWe had a recent sale in Hong Kong, online, that was pretty much exclusively diamonds, and it did incredibly well.\u201d It\u2019s true, she continues, that \u201cthere has been a softening\u201d in the auction\u00a0market for jewelry\u00a0as the value of loose stones\u00a0has declined. But demand has stayed strong, Becket says, for lots with a compelling provenance, a prestigious maker, or a uniquely compelling aesthetic element to the object.\u201cThe Tutti Frutti bracelet is a case in point,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe stones in a Tutti Frutti bracelet are pretty modest in intrinsic value,\u201d because Cartier purposefully chose flawed coloured stones to contrast with the brilliant diamonds and settings. \u201cSo the Tutti Frutti jewelry we value more as works of art.\u201dA Million Dollars, Sight UnseenNow\u00a0the question is whether or not buyers are willing to spend almost\u00a0a million dollars on a bracelet they\u2019ve never seen in person. Traditionally, Becket says,\u00a0people are most willing to buy things with which they\u2019re familiar: a Cartier \u201cLove\u201d bracelet or pieces made by famous jewelers such as\u00a0Graff or Bulgari.In the past few sales, though, Becket has seen a \u201cbroadening\u201d of what\u2019s done well at auction. \u201cA multicoloured pair of ear-clips, something we wouldn\u2019t think would do that well online, suddenly has a number of bids,\u201d she says. So the Tutti Frutti bracelet may well be the ultimate test of buyers\u2019 willingness to take leaps of faith at online auctions.\u201cIf these kind of pieces continue to do well, it will mean the pandemic has forced us to arrive at the place we were heading anyway,\u201d she\u00a0says, \u201cwhere people have become more and more comfortable buying things online, sight unseen.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Elena Mazneva", "title": "\u2018The Fed can\u2019t print gold\u2019: How the yellow metal could hit $3,000 \u2014 50% above the current record", "description": "Bank of America\u2019s bullish call on bullion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/gold-to-reach-3000-50-above-its-record-bank-of-america-says?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/gold-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 12:45 PM EDT", "content": "Bank of America Corp. raised its 18-month gold-price target to US$3,000 an ounce \u2014 more than 50 per cent above the existing price record \u2014 in a report titled \u201cThe Fed can\u2019t print gold.\u201dThe bank increased its target from US$2,000 previously, as policy makers across the globe unleash vast amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus to help shore up economies hurt by the coronavirus.\u201cAs economic output contracts sharply, fiscal outlays surge, and central bank balance sheets double, fiat currencies could come under pressure,\u201d analysts including Michael Widmer and Francisco Blanch said in the report. \u201cInvestors will aim for gold.\u201d \nWho knew?

Seemingly nothing \u2014 not debt, not competition, not bad reviews \u2014 could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries. \nNetflix gains almost 16 million subscribers \u2014 but CEO warns investors not to get too excited\nNetflix heard the complaints: You can now turn off that annoying autoplay\nHow many people really are watching \u2018The Mandalorian\u2019? Data firms offer numbers that Disney and Netflix won\u2019t\nBut the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d as well as a movie starring\u00a0Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.With a lineup that includes\u00a0\u201cToo Hot to Handle,\u201d \u201cBlack AF\u201d and \u201cSpace Force,\u201d Netflix isn\u2019t going to run out of shows this quarter.\u00a0It also has the rights to the\u00a0Michael Jordan documentary \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last\u00a0quarter.\u201cNo one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages\u00a0and post-production) will play out,\u201d the company said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie \u201cKlaus,\u201d and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It\u2019s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.If Netflix can\u2019t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theatres. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix \u201cThe Lovebirds,\u201d a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of \u201cStranger Things\u201d fame.Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theatres, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.But if Netflix can\u2019t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost-conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What\u2019s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That\u2019s why Netflix has minimized the impact of\u00a0rival studios pulling popular programs like \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFriends.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto home sales plunge 69% in first half of April as buyers, sellers stay home", "description": "Prices dip 1.5%, signalling market still tight", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/toronto-home-sales-plunge-69-in-first-half-of-april-prices-dip?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/house-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 7:36 AM EDT", "content": "Toronto home sales and listings plunged in the first part of April as the COVID-19 pandemic curbed demand in Canada\u2019s largest city.Greater Toronto saw 1,654 home sales in the first 17 days of April, a 69 per cent drop from the same period a year ago.

The new Disney+ service surpassed 50 million subscribers in just five months, a faster pace than predicted. Three new video services, Quibi, Peacock and HBO Max, arrive this quarter and hope to have similarly rapid starts.Skeptics have said Netflix would lose customers to the new competition. But thus far, those fears have been unfounded.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is people are cutting linear TV and adding Disney+ on top of Netflix,\u201d said Nick Grous, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, which owns the shares.The quarter\u2019s results reflected two of Netflix\u2019s strengths: breadth of programming and a global footprint.Months after releasing Oscar-nominated movies such as \u201cThe Irishman\u201d and \u201cThe Two Popes,\u201d Netflix cracked the code on tabloid-style documentary TV. \u201cTiger King,\u201d about big-cat zoo owners, was the biggest new hit series for Netflix in the U.S. since \u201cStranger Things,\u201d according to Nielsen.Meanwhile, \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d a reality dating show, drew 30 million viewers in its first four weeks, Netflix said. A newer dating show, \u201cToo Hot to Handle,\u201d has been one of the most popular shows on Netflix since its release last week.Netflix also showed strong growth all around the world. Business in the U.S. and Canada picked up after a few sluggish quarters, with Netflix adding 2.31 million new customers in its biggest market. That was more than the prior three quarters combined. The company signed up nearly 7 million customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the most of any region.The coronavirus had another unintended benefit for Netflix: its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2014. Netflix produced $162 million in the first three months of the year. While the company had already vowed to narrow its cash burn in 2020, a worldwide pause in TV and movie production lowered costs in the quarter and will continue to do so this year.Production shutdowns could turn into a headache for Netflix depending on how long they last. Subscribers are accustomed to a steady flow of new content, and some of its competitors, such as Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.\u2019s WarnerMedia, have big libraries they can use to entice viewers. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix has finished production on most of its new programs for 2020.Prior to the earnings release, Netflix investors had sent the shares to record levels, making it especially hard for the company to sustain the rally \u2014 even with blockbuster numbers. The stock had climbed 34% through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared with a 15 per cent decline for the S&P 500.\u201cI understand the caution around the response to the stock,\u201d Grous said, before adding, \u201cBut we\u2019re not focused too much on quarter to quarter. We\u2019re thinking about the long-term trend here, and that is explosive growth.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Olivia Raimonde and Hailey Waller", "title": "Oil meltdown spreads with losses sweeping through other markets", "description": "There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-meltdown-spreads-beyond-expiring-contracts-as-wti-slumps-42", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/oilprice1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 3:26 PM EDT", "content": "Oil\u2019s collapse is deepening.Just a day after U.S. crude futures for May delivery plunged below zero for the first time ever, June futures plummeted 43 per cent to close below US$12 a barrel in New York.

Its deflationary effect threatens to further cripple economies around the world already reeling from coronavirus-fueled lockdowns. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers have become overwhelmed by a vast oversupply brought on by an unprecedented plunge in global fuel demand.Oil is a \u201cdangerous market to trade in right now,\u201d said Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP, in a Bloomberg TV interview. The market needs oil production to fall immediately for prices to recover, he said.The price crash spilled into the ETF market, with the biggest crude-tracking fund, the United States Oil Fund LP, moving some of its WTI contracts into later months, according to a regulatory filing. The June/July WTI spread rallied more than US$1 a barrel on the move.Oil Ministers from the OPEC+ coalition held an unscheduled conference call on Tuesday to discuss the collapse without settling on new policy measures. The Texas Railroad Commission, meanwhile, opted to put off a decision on whether to impose oil-production quotas.In London, the immediate contract for Brent crude was at the biggest discount to the following month in data since 2008. U.S. marker WTI\u2019s June contract was halted three times early in New York to manage the volatility, CME Group Inc. said.\u201cIf you start to look at the actual supply-demand situation for oil, it\u2019s not so obvious that by the time those contracts expire, the storage situation around Cushing will be very different than what it is in May,\u201d said Martijn Rats, Global Oil Strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Bloomberg Radio interview. \u201cThe prices of these futures will need to connect to the physical reality, and they are likely to crack lower.\u201dWTI for June dropped 43 per cent to US$11.57 a barrel in New York. The thinly traded May contract closed at US$10.01 a barrel.Brent crude futures for June slumped 24 per cent to close at US$19.33 a barrel.The collapse is reverberating across the oil industry, with prices trading below zero across America on Monday. WTI Midland in Texas \u2014 a flagship marker for the U.S. shale industry \u2014 was at -US$13.13 a barrel, while crude in Alaska was at -$US46.63.There are signs that these stunningly low prices are here to stay as tanks across the globe fill up. Royal Vopak NV, the world\u2019s biggest independent storage company, said almost all of its space is sold.Crude stockpiles at Cushing \u2014 America\u2019s key storage hub and delivery point of the WTI contract \u2014 have jumped 48% to almost 55 million barrels since the end of February. U.S. nationwide inventories are estimated to have increased another 14 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.The Dated Brent benchmark, a global reference for nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s physical flows, plunged to US$13.24 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest since 1999, according to price reporting agency S&P Global Platts. That means that key European and African crude streams, including Urals from Russia and Bonny Light from Nigeria, would sell now under $10 a barrel, as they trade at a discount to the Dated Brent benchmark.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Luke Kawa", "title": "Biggest oil ETF could go 'lights out,' warns Wall Street\u00a0strategist", "description": "A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/biggest-oil-etf-could-go-lights-out-warns-wall-street-strategist?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/oil-11.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 2:32 PM EDT", "content": "The blowup of leveraged exchange-traded products is old hat by now. But the recent price action in West Texas Intermediate raises the prospect of the unthinkable: A relatively plain-vanilla fund that offers investors exposure to fluctuations in crude prices might be worth less than nothing.The US$4.1 billion United States Oil Fund LP (ticker USO) slumped about 11 per cent to a record low on Monday as the front-month West Texas Intermediate contract made an unpredecented drop below zero, throwing into sharp relief the dearth of demand and storage capacity for the commodity stateside. The ETF tumbled 32 per cent to 12:44 p.m. in New York Tuesday.USO didn\u2019t own any May futures, with its roll into the June contract scheduled to have been completed by April 13. Its two biggest positions are in the June and July West Texas Intermediate contracts. The net asset value of its holdings could drop below zero in the event the June contract falls well below zero before the projected roll of the position, scheduled to take place from May 5 through May 8.An exchange-traded fund has not and cannot trade below zero, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Last week, the fund announced a reallocation of its holdings, aiming for 20 per cent exposure to the second-traded future rather than concentrating completely in the front month. Further adjusting this positioning could help protect against the net asset value of its holdings falling below zero. The lack of storage capacity in the near-term is the proximate cause for the May contract\u2019s swoon into negative territory, while contracts further out the curve remain in positive territory for now.Wall Street strategists are speculating about the possibility that a move below zero for the front-month contract this time could prove much more damaging to USO.\u201cAdditional hypothetical: the desk notes that despite there not being a redemption mechanism, there is certainly a scenario where if June futures were to also go negative, then USO would be \u2018lights out\u2019 as a partnership and could actually \u2018owe\u2019 money,\u201d writes Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities. The product\u2019s holdings account for roughly 30 per cent of open interest in the June futures contract, he added.The fund\u2019s prospectus allows for the termination of the fund on a discretionary basis, or resulting from the bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of the United States Commodity Funds LLC. \u201cHowever, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USO,\u201d according to the prospectus.John Love, president of USCF LLC, did not immediately respond to phone calls or an emailed request for comment.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management, talked to Bloomberg TV about the uncertainty regarding who might be exposed in the event that worst-case scenarios for USO come to pass.\u201cThere has been some speculation that the CME or the clearing exchanges may be somehow on the hook for that, or the ETF provider,\u201d she said. \u201cUnclear right now, if the June contract were to go negative who would be on the hook for that but it is certainly part of the enhanced volatility we\u2019re seeing around the trading, both in WTI and in USO today.\u201dIn the case of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), the exchange-traded product that offered inverse exposure to short-term volatility futures, language governing so called \u201cacceleration events\u201d that could result in its closure were clearly outlined in the prospectus. Credit Suisse announced the early redemption of XIV on Feb. 6, the day following an unprecedented doubling in the VIX Index that saw the indicative intraday value of the short-volatility product plummet by more than 80 per cent.USO posted a record inflow last week as traders speculated that depressed oil prices had nowhere to go but up, bets that have since soured spectacularly.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kevin Orland", "title": "In Calgary, an epic real estate glut compounds the misery of a pandemic and oil crash", "description": "One firm projects more than 33% of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and 'a huge crater' in city finances", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/in-canadas-oil-capital-a-real-estate-glut-compounds-the-misery?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/calgary-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 9:35 AM EDT", "content": "From the outside, the roughly diamond-shaped Nexen tower is one of the more recognizable features of Calgary\u2019s skyline.

In Canada\u2019s energy capital, they\u2019re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and \u201ca huge crater\u201d in local government finances. \nAlberta\u2019s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility\nAnxiety mounts among Albertans as province faces \u2018profound adversity\u2019 not seen since the 1930s\nWhat will our post-pandemic energy future look like? It could very well be a brave new world\nIt\u2019s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada\u2019s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade\u2019s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market\u2019s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there\u2019s an epic glut. Net asking rents \u2014 what the landlord receives \u2014 for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America\u2019s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Boom, Bust, BustFour buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.\u201cThe office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,\u201d said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.\n\nThe Calgary skyline on Feb. 27, 2020.\n\nGavin Young/Postmedia files\n\nCanada\u2019s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers\u2019 ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time \n \n\u201cThere was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,\u201d said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Canada. \u201cWhereas now, it\u2019s been bust for a long time.\u201d His firm sees the city\u2019s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they\u2019re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,\u201d Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn\u2019t survive or deserted their leased space.Unemployment RisingThe crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil\u2019s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary\u2019s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nLandlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said.

Including residential construction, it accounted for 15 per cent of economic output last year; energy accounted for 9 per cent.If it collapses, there\u2019s not much that can pick up the slack \u2014 certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer. Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s. Toronto and Vancouver, the two biggest housing markets, haven\u2019t had a major correction during that time. Housing turned into a wealth-conjuring machine. As values spiralled higher, homeowners felt richer \u2014 they spent more, borrowed more, and sent prices even higher.\n\nResidential condo buildings and single family houses are seen above Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDarryl Dyck/Bloomberg files\n\nThat virtuous circle just popped. The City of Vancouver fears it\u2019s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 per cent of households say they can\u2019t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year.It\u2019s a stunning contrast to 2016, when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than $1,600 (US$1,130) a day without ever leaving home. In one year, the city\u2019s properties surged in value by $47 billion, more than double the cumulative take-home income of all its residents.Tellingly, billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t use your house like an ATM\u201d \u2014 as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations, vacations, and rental properties.This virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted \n \nToday, Canadian households owe $1.76 for every dollar in disposable income. In Vancouver, that spikes to about $2.40 \u2014 a ratio that puts the so-called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis.Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt \u2014 an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record. Canadians owe $2.3 trillion in mortgages, credit card, and other consumer debt, about equal to the country\u2019s GDP, which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust.\u201cYou have all of these flammable items that just need a spark, some external shock,\u201d says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Toronto-based Veritas Investment Research Corp. \u201cAnd this virus is a worst-case scenario none of us would have predicted.\u201dAirbnb Customers VanishIt doesn\u2019t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown. If only 2 per cent of the housing stock were to be listed for sale, it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash, according to Veritas.That\u2019s most likely to come from investors, half of whom weren\u2019t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties, Veritas found in a survey last September.For loss-making landlords, things are about to get a lot worse: about 30 per cent of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected, according to estimates by CIBC Economics. That\u2019s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections.\n\nThe logo of the online lodging service Airbnb on a smartphone.\n\nLionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nThen there are those who invested in properties for the short-term rental market that\u2019s all but dried up because of travel restrictions. Nearly a third of Canada\u2019s Airbnb hosts \u2014 who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 \u2014 need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction, Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month.Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters, more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens, many offering COVID-19 discounts, according to data from Toronto-based Harmari, which analyzes online classifieds. Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings.Shaky PillarsEconomists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing: a robust labour market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century. Neither is holding up.Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support. Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages, about 12 per cent of the mortgages they hold, as of April 9. Meanwhile, immigration targets, based upon an earlier growing labour shortage, will almost certainly be scaled back.In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis, the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to backstop the market, while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses.\u201cIt\u2019s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter\u2019s grandchildren aren\u2019t even going to be able to pay this off,\u201d says Reza Sabour, a Vancouver mortgage broker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan after?\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matt Day", "title": "Jeff Bezos wants regular, in-house testing of all Amazon employees for COVID-19", "description": "Bezos said company assembled team of scientists, managers and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build first testing lab soon", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/jeff-bezos-wants-regular-in-house-testing-of-all-amazon-employees-for-covid-19?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jeff-bezos-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 16, 2020 11:25 AM EDT", "content": "Amazon.com Inc.

In Canada, provinces have control over many economic policies as well as public services from education to health. California and some of America\u2019s most powerful states are forming their own regional alliances to coordinate the resumption of business, sparking a spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he has \u201ctotal\u201d authority to reopen the world\u2019s largest economy.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday the Canadian government is \u201ccoordinating\u201d his country\u2019s response.\u201cWe are having ongoing discussions with the provinces at this point,\u201d he said a news conference in Ottawa. \u201cWe recognize that different regions of the country are at different points along the evolution of their COVID-19 curve.

The transaction allowed Buffett to deploy a large sum of his cash pile and accrue generous dividends.Buffett has been struggling in recent years to find attractive ways to deploy his cash, which was close to a record US$128 billion at the end of last year.

The central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero and injected $150 billion into financial markets with a program of asset purchases.Additional measures could include following the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s recent move into yield curve control, introducing more explicit forward guidance on future policy intentions, or broadening asset purchases to include long-term provincial securities and corporate debt. \n\u2018Crisis like no other\u2019: IMF warns \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 recession will be worst in almost 100 years\nWhy Trudeau should put aside his personal agenda and ask Bank of Canada's Poloz to delay retirement\nCanada is at a critical juncture \u2014 if we don\u2019t transform our economy then we will face a greater crisis\nOne thing he\u2019s not expected to do is lower the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate below the current setting of 0.25 per cent, which Poloz has said is the effective lower bound.The Bank of Canada embarked on its first ever large scale asset purchase program last month. The move to buy at least $5 billion of Canadian government bonds each week, on top of almost $100 billion of securities purchased under resale agreements, will help sop up the massive amount of debt the federal government is expected to issue in coming months to finance its stimulus package.That program could easily be expanded to include other asset classes, with longer-dated provincial bonds the most likely option, according to Derek Holt at Scotiabank. That\u2019s one corner of the credit markets still experiencing strained credit conditions, at a time when provincial governments are looking to finance growing deficits.By targeting provincial debt, \u201cyou\u2019d be saying \u2018look, we\u2019ve got your back,\u2019\u201d Holt said in a phone interview, adding that would likely have beneficial effects on borrowing costs for municipalities, agencies and large corporations. Though one difficulty is political: how much of each province\u2019s debt to buy?Expanding PurchasesThe central bank could also increase weekly purchases to more than $5 billion, or buy more non-government debt such as mortgage bonds or corporate securities.Right now, the bank is acquiring assets primarily to restore proper functioning of financial markets, which is why much of the buying has been at the shorter end. But as markets return to more normal conditions, it will eventually need to shift its focus to stimulating the economy. To do that, officials will need to target longer-term borrowing costs where most of the funding for households and businesses takes place, a practice known as quantitative easing.There are doubts whether QE can be effective in smaller countries like Canada whose long-term bond yields are dictated by monetary policy in other countries. But the practice can be much more effective if the asset buying is concentrated around specific maturities, what economists call yield curve control.Focusing on the five-year part of the curve would be the most compelling move, according to Ian Pollick at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cTo do this, they would likely target a \u2018zone\u2019 for yields in a part of the curve that matter most for businesses and households, which in our view is the 5-year tenor of the curve,\u201d Pollick, global head of non-equity market research, said in a report.Provide ClarityAustralia\u2019s central bank adopted a similar policy last month, when it announced a target for 3-year government bonds of around 0.25 per cent.The central bank may also commit to specific monetary policy intentions for a certain period, a tool known as forward guidance. Promising to keep rates low for a long time reduces the risk of a spike in funding costs, allowing banks to offer lower rates to households and businesses than they otherwise might.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz provided a sliver of guidance when he promised last month to continue buying assets until the \u201ceconomic recovery is well underway.\u201d More clarity around that promise could help cement expectations that interest rates will remain low for much longer.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks surge on signs coronavirus spread is easing; earnings season kicks off", "description": "Investors are now eyeing the easing of virus-related restrictions in some regions for further trading cues", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/refile-global-markets-stocks-rise-on-china-trade-data-easing-pandemic-fears?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/trade.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 4:19 PM EDT", "content": "Stocks rallied on some signs the coronavirus outbreak is either leveling off or easing, with traders assessing the first reports of the cloudy corporate earnings season.The S&P 500 jumped to a one-month high while giant technology companies pushed the Nasdaq 100 through its 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages.

It would also dwarf the 0.1 per cent contraction of 2009 amid the financial crisis.Like in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shockGita Gopinath, IMF's chief economist \n \nWhile the fund anticipated growth of 5.8 per cent next year, which would be the strongest in records dating back to 1980, it cautioned risks lay to the downside. Much depends on the longevity of the pandemic, its effect on activity and related stresses in financial and commodity markets, it said.Even if the IMF\u2019s forecast proves accurate, it said output in both advanced and emerging markets would undershoot their pre-virus trends through 2021, seemingly dashing any lingering hopes of a V-shaped economic rebound from the health emergency. \nAdvanced economies will shrink this quarter four times as much as the record 2008 slump, says Goldman Sachs\nThe \u2018terrible agonizing noise\u2019 of Canada\u2019s economic data in a crisis like no other\nMillennials are getting crushed by back-to-back economic crises\nIn a further sign of pessimism, the IMF sketched out three alternative scenarios in which the virus lasted longer than expected, returned in 2021 or both. A lengthier pandemic would wipe 3 per cent off GDP this year compared to the baseline, while protraction plus a resumption next year would mean 8 per cent less output than projected in 2021, it said.\u201cThis crisis is like no other,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a foreword to its semi-annual report. \u201cLike in a war or a political crisis, there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock.\u201dAs with the virus\u2019s reach, the economic hit is sweeping. In the U.S., gross domestic product is expected to contract 5.9 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent expansion in its last global outlook in January. It may grow 4.7 per cent next year, the IMF said. The euro area will probably shrink 7.5 per cent in 2020 and expand 4.7 per cent in 2021, it said.\u201cMany countries face a multi-layered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic economic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital-flow reversals and a collapse in commodity prices,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cRisks of a worse outcome predominate.\u201dThe grim projections are a stark reversal from the IMF\u2019s outlook less than two months ago. On Feb. 19, the fund told Group of 20 finance chiefs that \u201cglobal growth appears to be bottoming out.\u201d Three days later, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva predicted the virus would likely cut just 0.1 percentage point from the fund\u2019s global growth forecast for this year, although she acknowledged \u201cmore dire scenarios\u201d were being studied.The fund sees advanced economies shrinking the most, contracting 6.1 per cent. Emerging-market and developing economies will see a 1 per cent drop. Growth in China and India will decelerate but their economies will still manage to expand 1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, the fund said.The IMF\u2019s baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of this year and that containment measures can be gradually wound down.Global trade volume in goods and services will probably tumble 11 per cent this year, the fund said.Growth in consumer prices in advanced economies may average 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating to 1.5 per cent in 2021, it said. The jobless rate in the U.S., which was at a half-century low before the pandemic, may swell to 10.4 per cent in 2020, the IMF said.Most central banks around the world have cut interest rates to around or below zero to blunt the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal stimulus packages have varied more. The U.S. is providing about 10 per cent of gross domestic product in support and Germany about 4.5 per cent, while Japan\u2019s program is worth about 20 per cent of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.The IMF said that fiscal measures will need to increase if stoppages to economic activity persist, or if the pickup in activity once restrictions are lifted is too weak. Economies with financing constraints may also require external support, the fund said. Georgieva had repeatedly pledged to use the IMF\u2019s $1 trillion in loan capacity to help its members.The IMF and World Bank are holding their spring meetings via video conference for the first time ever this week.

Bullish investors are also looking past the shutdown of the company\u2019s vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California, which could last at least another month, further complicating the delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, he said.Credit Suisse\u2019s Levy also sees Tesla coming up short of its full-year deliveries guidance and is now estimating the company will hand over about 400,000 electric vehicles to customers this year, down from his previous projection for 550,000.While Levy estimates Tesla is burning about US$300 million of cash every week that its Fremont factory is down, he believes the company will emerge from the crisis with advantages over other automakers.\u201cIt likely has a lead in batteries, its liquidity is improved and it has shown signs of improvements in basic auto execution,\u201d Levy said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jenny Leonard", "title": "Trump administration eases PPE export ban with Canada, Mexico exemptions", "description": "The list of exemptions grows after lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rules", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-administration-eases-ppe-export-ban-with-canada-mexico-exemptions", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/3m-masks.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 14, 2020 10:28 AM EDT", "content": "The Trump administration eased a ban on exports of personal protective equipment, with the list of exemptions growing after lawyers laid out the shortcomings of the rules, people familiar with the situation said.Exports to Canada, Mexico and U.S. entities such as military bases abroad are among the exemptions, according to an internal Customs and Border Protection memo obtained by Bloomberg News.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest.

The dollar\u2019s surge has been particularly painful for countries that ran up borrowing in greenbacks and which will now struggle to cover the loans, especially as their exports tumble.G-20 finance ministers and central bankers will convene by conference call on Wednesday. They are planning to offer lower income countries a freeze on bilateral government loan repayments for six or nine months or possibly into 2021, the Financial Times reported, citing an official.That fits a plan championed by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass. The World Bank in March estimated that US$14 billion in service payments are due this year.The fear is that if the emerging markets lag behind, \u201cit means more of a U-shaped or an L-shaped kind of recovery for the U.S. and global economies,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, a former U.S. Treasury official who\u2019s now chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income.While the U.S., Europe and Japan have opened up the monetary and budgetary spigots to fight Covid-19 and its economic after-effects, many emerging economies lack the scope to do so.Morgan Stanley economists predict that emerging markets, excluding China, will shrink 4.1 per cent in the current quarter, a deeper dive than the 3.1 per cent of the first quarter of 2009 when the world was last in crisis, though shallower than what\u2019s expected in richer economies. They also estimated in an April 3 report that the peak rate of growth during the recovery for those economies will be 6 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus 7.7 per cent in the same period of 2010.The problem is even more acute in the poorest nations, where many denizens can\u2019t easily practice the social distancing and regular hand washing that has become de-rigueur in rich countries.Such an environment leaves the IMF reckoning that emerging market and developing countries will need trillions of dollars in external financing to fight the virus, only part of which they can cover on their own, leaving gaps of hundreds of billions of dollars. Half of the international lending organization\u2019s 189 members are already looking to it for aid.Georgieva is trying to rally the world into a unified display of support at the Fund\u2019s semi-annual meeting, which starts Tuesday as a virtual gathering after the typical spring gathering in Washington was re-imagined.\u201cToday we are confronted with a crisis like no other,\u201d Georgieva said in an April 9 speech. \u201cThe actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery.\u201dThere are questions, though, about whether the Fund has enough to counter the crisis, especially if it proves protracted.While the IMF says it has a US$1 trillion war chest, Ted Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the maximum amount available for new lending is US$787 billion, after taking into account existing commitments and other factors. \u201cThe IMF will need more\u201d from the U.S. and the rest of the G20, he said.And it\u2019s not just the amount of resources that are at issue. It\u2019s what kind they are.The crisis has exposed a gaping hole at the center of the global economy. There\u2019s no ultimate lender of last resort who can provide the liquidity that\u2019s demanded in a financial emergency.Funds PulledSome $62 billion was yanked out of emerging markets in the first quarter in a global dash for cash by investors, twice the size of outflows at the peak of the world financial crisis, according to the Institute of International Finance.While there are signs that pressure is easing \u2014 Indonesia, for example, sold $4.3 billion of dollar bonds last week to help finance virus relief measures \u2014 there are risks the outflows could resume as the hit to emerging market growth becomes more evident, IIF analysts said.The Federal Reserve has moved to partly fill the void, including opening up dollar liquidity swap lines with Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Sheets said it should do the same with India, Indonesia and Chile.The IMF also has to step up and be willing to set its aside its traditional playbook for dealing with countries in trouble, in which it demands economic reforms in return for financial assistance.\u201cThis is much more of an exogenous shock,\u201d said former U.S. Treasury official Mark Sobel, now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank focused on economic policy and central banking. \u201cThere needs to be some recalibration by the IMF to provide far more liberal and fast liquidity to members.\u201dThe fund seems to be trying to do just that.It\u2019s looking at the use of precautionary short-term loans to get cash to countries, as well as other funding options like the increased use of reserve assets called special drawing rights, steps that would require the approval of rich nations.One problem with the IMF stepping up, said ex-IMF official Taimur Baig: Many countries don\u2019t like turning to the organization because they fear being tarred as a nation in trouble.Repayment Pause\u201cDrawing on to IMF resources has an element of stigma and it is still seen as the last resort of a crisis-hit nation,\u201d said Baig, who\u2019s now chief economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.For some emerging economies with balance of payment challenges, the \u201cmore expedient\u201d currency-stabilizing measure is to draw on swap lines or repurchase agreements, as Indonesia has done, said Baig, questioning why the IMF doesn\u2019t also offer those facilities.In the 2008-09 crisis, the G-20 banded together to come up with an action plan.That\u2019s been more difficult this time for a group riven by rivalries \u2014 the U.S. and China over trade, Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil, and the U.K. and the European Union over Brexit.IIF President Tim Adams said the G-20 must rise to the occasion, nonetheless.\u201cThere will be enormous attention and enormous expectations\u201d focused on this week\u2019s gatherings, he said. \u201cNot meeting them could be detrimental for markets and for confidence.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joanna Ossinger", "title": "U.S. stocks have likely bottomed, Goldman says", "description": "A combination of unprecedented policy support and a flattening viral curve has 'dramatically' cut risks to both markets and the American economy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/goldman-says-u-s-stocks-have-likely-bottomed-on-policy-support?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/nyse.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2020 9:40 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks are unlikely to make fresh lows thanks to the \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d approach of policy makers, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.A combination of unprecedented policy support and a flattening viral curve has \u201cdramatically\u201d cut risks to both markets and the American economy, strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note Monday.

At least the two high-end devices will have flat stainless steel edges instead of the current curved design as well as more sharply rounded corners like the iPad Pro introduced in 2018. Reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design, the new handsets will have flat screens rather than the sloping edges on current models, said the people asking not to be identified because the plans aren\u2019t public.Apple has also been developing a smaller and cheaper version of its HomePod speaker, to be released as early as this year, and so-called Apple Tags that will let users track real-world objects like keys and wallets, according to people who\u2019ve seen prototypes. \nApple shares drop more than 4% after sales warning on coronavirus sends shockwaves through tech sector\nApple\u2019s push into TV is \u2018failing to resonate\u2019 with consumers, analyst says\nApple iPhone sales grow again, pushing profits above expectations\nBecause of disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, at least some of the new iPhones could be released multiple weeks later than normal, though still within the typical fall window, people familiar with the launch plans said. Apple hasn\u2019t informed suppliers of any significant delays, other people said, and its engineers are expected to travel to China and finalize product designs in May.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.The upcoming iPhone Pro models will include three cameras on the back while the lower-end phones will continue to have two cameras, as with the current lineup. Apple will add the 3-D LIDAR system that debuted with the iPad Pro in March to its top-tier devices, setting the stage for advances in augmented-reality applications.The highest-end new iPhone is set to have a screen slightly larger than the 6.5-inch panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple is investigating removing the cutout at the top of the display for the selfie camera and Face ID sensors in future designs, and it\u2019s likely to reduce that notch in size with this year\u2019s models.All the phones are planned to include a significant upgrade to the processor with an emphasis on speeding up artificial intelligence and AR tasks, people familiar with the devices said.Since 2012, Apple has released major new iPhones each September, except for the release of the iPhone X in 2017 that came in November due to supply constraints.This year, the company is navigating a global pandemic that temporarily slowed its China-based supply chain and has hurt smartphone demand due to a stalled global economy. Virus-fighting travel restrictions have also pushed Apple engineers to work primarily from home.Given the uncertainty surrounding the spread of the novel coronavirus and the shifting economy, Apple\u2019s launch plans and iPhone specifications could still change.Apple\u2019s new HomePod speaker will be about half the size of the original while keeping a similar design, people familiar with its development said. The device has been in development for several months and faced delays, and Apple is now targeting a release in the second half of this year, they added. Offering it at a lower price will help Apple better compete with cheap smart speakers from Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which currently dominate the U.S. market. The HomePod has largely been seen as a failure in terms of sales, though its superior sound quality remains a competitive advantage.Beyond price, the HomePod\u2019s comparative lack of success has also been driven by its narrower compatibility with music streaming services and smart home products as well as the limited functionality of Apple\u2019s voice assistant, Siri. The company has been acquiring AI startups to help it bolster Siri, is hiring a team to revamp its smart home efforts and plans to add additional music services to the HomePod, Bloomberg News has reported.The Apple Tags wireless accessory will offer functionality much like gadgets already on the market like Tile trackers, people familiar with the product said. It will be bundled with an Apple-designed leather sleeve and a keychain to attach it to objects, they said. The thin, small, puck-shaped tags have been in development for over a year and are planned for release as early as this year.Apple is also working on a new version of the MacBook Pro, Apple TV, refreshed budget iPads and a new iMac, people familiar with its product roadmap said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Javier Blas", "title": "Donald Trump's oil deal: The inside story of how the price war ended", "description": "Fearing job losses oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/trump-oil-price-deal-inside-story?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/donald-trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 13, 2020 9:05 AM EDT", "content": "After a week-long marathon of calls between world leaders and video conferences featuring dozens of energy ministers, it was the moment the 2020 oil price war finally ended.From Villahermosa, a city near Mexico\u2019s largest crude terminal, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle raised her voice. \u201cYour Royal Highness, Mexico has already agreed. And now I would like to ask you: \u2018Do you agree with these terms?\u2019\u201dIn Riyadh, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman nearly chuckled as he looked at a wall of video feeds showing his counterparts around the world. \u201cI go with the consensus. I agree,\u201d he replied.At that moment, the OPEC+ alliance sealed the largest ever coordinated production cut, removing about a 10th of global supply. The historic deal had almost been derailed by a fight between Saudi Arabia and Mexico\u2019s populist government, forcing President Donald Trump to step in and broker a face-saving solution.Prince Abdulaziz declared himself sleepless and exhausted, but triumphant nonetheless. \nOil prices slip after early gains on worries that OPEC+\u2019s historic output cut won\u2019t be enough\nOil price war ends with historic OPEC+ deal for biggest output cut ever of 9.7 million barrels a day\nAs OPEC\u2019s tentative deal falls short, Canadian producers fear 1.7 million barrels a day will be shut in\n\u201cWe have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and alive,\u201d he told Bloomberg News in an interview minutes after he clinched the agreement. \u201cI\u2019m more than happy.\u201dFor the past month, Saudi Arabia had pumped every possible barrel for sale at rock-bottom prices, punishing Russia for refusing to support deeper OPEC+ output cuts in early March. Now, Moscow and Riyadh will both reduce daily production by millions of barrels, spearheading a global agreement between almost all the world\u2019s major oil producers to rein in output.We have demonstrated that OPEC+ is up, running, and aliveSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman \n \nBut the deal will only dull the pain, not end the crisis.The market is likely to remain overwhelmed for months to come by the catastrophic collapse in demand caused by the lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus through some of the world\u2019s biggest economies.\u201cThe OPEC+ agreement will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, and near-term oil prices in the physical market will likely remain under pressure,\u201d said Martijn Rats, oil analyst at Morgan Stanley.Negative ReactionThe deal between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will remove nearly 10 million barrels a day from the market through deliberate cuts. In addition, the group is counting involuntary declines in the production of the U.S., Canada, Brazil and several other countries, as companies reduce drilling activity due to low prices and weak demand.OPEC+ officials, using some creative accounting that also includes output drops in Venezuela, Iran and Libya, which are exempt from making cuts, said that as much as 20 million barrels a day will over time leave the market \u2014 20 per cent of global production.Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19\u2026..\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2020For the time being, the world will need to be content with the 10 million barrels a day from OPEC+. Yet demand is down by about twice that amount, meaning the world\u2019s oil tanks will keep filling day after day as long as planes stay grounded, businesses shuttered and billions of people remain at home.Oil traders don\u2019t seem optimistic. By 9 a.m. in London, prices had slipped into negative territory, falling as much as 2.7 per cent to US$30.63 a barrel.Deal MakerThe biggest winner appears to be Trump, who refused to deliberately cut American oil production, but was still able to broker the final deal. His phone call with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, followed by a three-way conference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, came up with the proposal that resolved the Latin American nation\u2019s objections to the agreement.Trump has taken time away from grappling with the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak and waded into oil politics with a surprising goal. He\u2019s gone from welcoming the crude price collapse to worrying about losing the American energy industry. Fearing that job losses in Texas and other oil-rich states could hurt his re-election prospects, he convinced Putin and the Saudi monarch to end hostilities and make a compromise. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca836eca2b');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca836eca2b');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca836eca2b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\n\u201cTrump views himself as a deal maker,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, an energy consultant and former U.S. government oil official. So \u201cTrump went to the oil market\u2019s red phone.\u201dThe president sealed the historic deal by offering the Saudis something that exists only on paper. When Mexico refused a big output reduction, putting the whole agreement in danger, Trump assured OPEC+ that the U.S. would cut its own production on its neighbour\u2019s behalf.Mexico would remove 100,000 barrels a day, and the U.S. would contribute an additional 300,000 barrels a day, Trump said at the White House. OPEC+ officials and others involved in the talks said those extra barrels simply didn\u2019t exist. The decline in American production would be driven by prices, demand, and capacity in pipelines or tanks, not presidential press conferences.But ultimately his offer was enough.Price WarSunday\u2019s agreement ended a period in which the OPEC+ alliance appeared to be dead, with former partners engaged in oil-trade warfare.It all started on March 6, when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak walked out of OPEC\u2019s headquarters in Vienna and told reporters that his country was ready to increase oil production in April. He had just rebuffed Saudi Arabia\u2019s push for his country to cut output by a few hundred thousand barrels a day, to help counter what most saw as a modest demand slowdown due to the coronavirus. In return, the kingdom had rejected his proposal to continue the group\u2019s existing curbs at their current level.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Minister of Energy Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak at the start of an OPEC and NON-OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, December 6, 2019.\n\nLeonhard Foeger/Reuters files\n\nAngered by Russia\u2019s refusal to cut and Novak\u2019s talk of higher production, Saudi Arabia embarked on a shock-and-awe price war. Riyadh offered oil refiners unprecedented discounts for its crude, cutting its official selling prices by the most in more than 30 years. The kingdom also announced it was boosting production to an all-time high above 12 million barrels a day for April, up 25 per cent from February.When the market opened a few hours later, even the most bearish traders were shocked. The Sunday evening session is typically a sedate affair, mostly covered by traders in Asia, where it\u2019s already Monday morning. But that night, every trader from Geneva to London and Houston was glued to their screens.When the selling started, benchmark Brent crude plunged more than 30 per cent in seconds \u2014 the biggest one-day drop since the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War.Month of ChaosWhat followed was the most chaotic month in the oil market\u2019s history, threatening the stability of the petroleum-dependent nations from Nigeria to Iraq and upending the business plans of industry giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time. By early March, the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond Wuhan, infecting thousands of people from Iran to the U.S. Around the world, governments copied the lockdowns that China had already tried and tested. Country after country put their economies into deep freeze.With demand for jet fuel, gasoline and diesel sharply down, refineries cut production and reduced their crude purchases. The physical oil market started to resemble a closing-down sale. In one obscure corner of the U.S., oil even traded at negative prices, with producers paying consumers to take away their barrels.Without fully realizing it, the Saudis had started a price war at the worst possible time \n \nBrent crude, the North Sea blend used as a global benchmark, had briefly traded above US$70 a barrel at the start of the year. On March 30, it plunged to US$21.65, the lowest in nearly two decades.The most prominent victim was the U.S. shale industry. Drillers in Texas and other states had turned America into the world\u2019s largest oil producer, creating millions of jobs. But fracking is an expensive way to pump crude and the industry had piled up tens of billions of dollars in debt.As prices tumbled, roughnecks, truck divers and engineers quickly lost their jobs. Whiting Petroleum Corp., once North Dakota\u2019s biggest producer, filed for bankruptcy on April 1.Saudi SurgeAs Whiting was going bust, thousands of miles in Saudi Arabia engineers at Aramco were busy pushing their oil wells to the limit.At at exactly 11.29 a.m. on March 31, the giant video wall at the company\u2019s operational nerve centre flashed total production surpassing 12 million barrels a day for the first time in history. Employees celebrated by snapping pictures, arms raised in triumph, according to photographs seen by Bloomberg News.\n\nAn employee rides a bicycle next to oil tanks at Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMaxim Shemetov/Reuters files\n\nThe next day Saudi output crept higher, reaching 12.111 million, then 12.171 million, according to other photographs of the control room. Finally, it hit a record of 12.323 million barrels a day \u2014 enough to meet the combined pre-pandemic consumption of Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Spain and Italy and still have some barrels to spare.The oil was being loaded onto an armada of tankers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, heading for markets that were already drowning in crude.\u2018Wiped Out\u2019It was an untenable situation, threatening to fill the world\u2019s oil tanks within a few months and send prices crashing to levels not seen since the 1990s. Trump was already putting pressure on Russia and Saudi Arabia to rebuild their alliance.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do. The price is so low,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview. The president, who had made a political career bashing OPEC and advocating for low gasoline prices, was worried the U.S. industry would be \u201cwiped out.\u201dSaudi Arabia and Russian blamed each other for the crash. Putin accused Saudi Arabia of trying to destroy shale; the Saudis said Moscow had kicked the whole thing off. None of it cut any ice in Washington.\u201dOf \n \n done in his life, this has to be the biggest\u201d source=\u201dDaniel Yergin\u201d /]\u201cYou are waging economic warfare on Texas,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz told the Saudi ambassador in Washington in a private conference call.Recalling the conversation in a media interview afterward, Cruz said: \u201cTheir response is, \u2018But Russia. But Russia.\u2019 And I said, \u2018But Russia garbage. Russia is our enemy, we know it. They behave like it and we treat them like it. You\u2019re supposed to be our friend. And so don\u2019t screw with us.\u201dBy then, both Saudi Arabia and Russia had little choice but to start talking. With consumption in free fall, it was only a question of time before they were forced to cut output, simply because there would be nowhere to put the oil.\u201cWe see a huge oversupply in the oil market,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency.Trump TweetTrump spoke to both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, proposing a global deal to cut production. He couldn\u2019t help boasting about the talks before the deal was in place, announcing in a tweet on April 2 that he hoped Riyadh and Moscow would cut output by 10 million barrels a day, if not more.Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2020Brent crude jumped more than 45 per cent in just a few seconds, crushing many bearish investors. Even when the market closed hours later, the benchmark was still up 21 per cent \u2014 the largest one-day increase ever.Unsurprisingly for a deal that includes dozens of countries in the OPEC+ coalition and the G-20, the final deal is a fudge. Saudi Arabia\u2019s production will only be 1.2 million barrels a day lower than its average level before the price war. Mexico won special treatment and America\u2019s cuts are just an estimate based on forecasts for drilling.The trajectory of oil prices will be more dependent on how fast the world leaves lockdown and the pace of the economic rebound. Yet the deal\u2019s significance goes beyond numbers.There has been a tectonic shift in global oil politics. Putin, MBS and Trump, the leaders of the the world\u2019s three largest producers, are dictating global petroleum supply. And America now accepts that low prices aren\u2019t in its interest.\u201cTrump, who has been a critic of OPEC for years, is the one who put it together,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian. \u201cOf all the deals he\u2019s done in his life, this has to be the biggest.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith, Javier Blas and Salma El Wardany", "title": "Oil price war ends with historic OPEC+ deal for biggest output cut ever of 9.7 million barrels a day", "description": "The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/opec-agrees-largest-ever-oil-output-cut-of-9-7-mln-bpd-sources?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/opec-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2020 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s top oil producers pulled off a historic deal to cut global crude output and put an end to a devastating price war.After a week-long marathon of bilateral talks and four days of video conferences with government ministers from around the world, an agreement finally emerged to tackle the impact of the global pandemic on demand.The talks almost fell apart because of resistance from Mexico, but came back from the brink after a weekend of urgent diplomacy \u2014 with the clock ticking down to the market open. \nCanada did not agree to specific oil production cuts in G20 meeting, natural resources minister says\nHow the coronavirus crash is setting the stage for the next oil boom\nAs OPEC's tentative deal falls short, Canadian producers fear 1.7 million barrels a day will be shut in\nOPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day \u2014 just below the initial plan of 10 million. Mexico appeared to have won a diplomatic victory as it will only be required to cut 100,000 barrels \u2014 less than its pro-rated share.With the virus paralyzing air and ground travel, demand for gasoline is collapsing and crude prices have plunged to 18-year lows. That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were \u201chorrifying.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn\u2019t go far enough.

The total amount of capital raised by the industry fell 69 per cent in March from a month earlier as funding sources dried up, according to Viridian Capital Advisors.This has weighed on stock prices. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Cannabis Competitive Peers Index fell more than 50 per cent between mid-February and its recent low on March 18, and had already lost two-thirds of its value in the 12 months before that.Based on an analysis of 1,400 consumer stocks during the tech bubble and the global financial crisis, Regan said pot stocks are likely to fall even further. In those two bear markets, valuations typically compressed 30 per cent to 50 per cent, falling to 2.4x sales or 7.5x EBITDA. While pot stocks have lost more than 50 per cent on average, many are still trading above those multiples. This is particularly true in Canada, where the average enterprise valuations are 5x sales and 11.3x EBITDA.Those that do survive will rebound sharply, but the trick will be picking the winners, he said.\u201cEven if the long-term cannabis investment thesis is intact, it\u2019s going to come down to executing on that idea to actually realize that return,\u201d Regan said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Claire Ballentine", "title": "TSX see biggest weekly gain since 2009 on Fed aid", "description": "U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly gain since 1974", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-gain-after-fed-steps-up-help-oil-gains-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 9, 2020 4:42 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks posted the biggest weekly gain since 1974 as investors looked past staggering jobless numbers when the Federal Reserve released new measures to cushion the fallout from the coronavirus.

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

Then one of the bank\u2019s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: \u201cThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr\u2019s note.\u201dThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's note \n \nMore than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan\u2019s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they\u2019re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home. \nCOVID-19: Fevers on the trading floor test Wall Street\u2019s \u2018tough guy\u2019 culture\nMassive stimulus packages in Canada, U.S. put cash on Main Street in departure from 2008 crisis\nBMO, CIBC join other firms in moving traders amid coronavirus outbreak\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stated many times that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. \u201cWe have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor\u2019s note.\u201dThose tensions aren\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It\u2019s the finance industry\u2019s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where \u201cessential\u201d workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Trading DelugeSome investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it\u2019s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank\u2019s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn\u2019t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it\u2019s trying to be respectful of people\u2019s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.\n\nA trader wears a mask as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 20, 2020.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters files\n\nTraders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn\u2019t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked \u201cimportant\u201d last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. \u201cWe remain open,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDriving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.\u201d Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown \u2014 even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Skeleton CrewsMost big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm\u2019s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor\u2019s note to work from home.\n\nA nearly deserted Wall Street and the steps of Federal Hall.\n\nMike Segar/Reuters\n\nInside Natixis SA\u2019s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: \u201cHighly Confidential: COVID-19 \u2014 Staff Infection List.\u201dWorkers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.\u201cNatixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. \u201cWe have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees\u2019 health and help slow the propagation of the virus.\u201d\u2018Push Everyone\u2019Market swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it\u2019s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York\u2019s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan\u2019s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank\u2019s global head of markets, \u201ccontinues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,\u201d Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna\u2019s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if they\u2019d been working from home.\u201cWith the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,\u201d Adragna wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET\u2019S GO.\u201d\n\nInside the Wall Street subway station in New York City.\n\nMichael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders\u2019 dealings. It isn\u2019t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven\u2019t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems \u201creasonably designed\u201d to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she\u2019s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she\u2019ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sarah Ponczek and Vildana Hajric", "title": "Stocks surge to 3-week high on reports that coronavirus death toll is easing in hot spots", "description": "'There is light at the end of the tunnel but it's still a long tunnel'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stocks-jump-with-u-s-futures-on-easing-virus-toll-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stocks-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 6, 2020 5:06 PM EDT", "content": "Stocks surged the most in almost two weeks after the reported death tolls in some of the world\u2019s coronavirus hot spots showed signs of easing.

Additionally, demand losses could see commercial inventory levels to be breached within two to three weeks if Canadian production isn\u2019t further reduced, Goldman Sachs estimated earlier this week.RBC\u2019s Pardy said Canadian oil producers will need to shut in or curtail about 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels per day, or one-quarter to one-third of supply, in the second and third quarters of this year.\u201cWe have fielded a number of queries regarding the potential role that policymakers in Canada could play in providing energy sector support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that Shut & Swap \u2014 a conceptual arrangement aimed at revenue smoothing \u2014 could be a partial remedy.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith", "title": "Oil demand shredded by coronavirus pandemic threatens shut-ins all over the world", "description": "'It's going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oils-stunning-demand-collapse-threatens-closures-everywhere?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shale.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 3, 2020 1:34 PM EDT", "content": "The survivors of oil\u2019s last crash were the lowest-cost producers. But the crisis engulfing the industry now is so fast, the same rules don\u2019t apply.From the shale patch of Texas and the oilsands of Canada to the plains of Siberia, production of at least one in every 10 barrels around the world is likely to be shuttered as demand is shredded by the coronavirus pandemic. Cost won\u2019t be the ultimate arbiter for producers this time, because as the International Energy Agency says, \u201cthere could soon be no place for their oil to go.\u201dEvery imaginable space \u2014 from tanks and pipelines to rail cars \u2014 is filling to the brim. It\u2019s a key reason that pressure is building for an output cut by OPEC and other producers at their meeting next week, though even the 10 million barrels a day of curbs that\u2019s been touted may not be enough. Only those who can find a place to shelter their unwanted crude are likely to remain standing. \nShockproofing Canada: Why the Keystone pipeline is just the start of making us energy self-sufficient\nTime to \u2018stand up against the OPEC dictatorships\u2019: Talk of North American oil cartel begins amid crisis\nMassive oilsands mine Fort Hills could be Alberta\u2019s first victim of the global price war\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about who\u2019s going to shut in. It\u2019s all dictated by logistics and where you sit in these major pipelines around the world,\u201d Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a Bloomberg television interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be Russia, the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America where you see the real damage.\u201dStaggering DestructionThe rout in demand is staggering. With large swathes of the global economy shut down to tackle the virus pandemic, with no idea of how long it\u2019ll continue, some oil traders are estimating an unprecedented 35 million barrels a day destruction in oil use.Even if OPEC and other producers agree to a 10 million barrels a day of output cuts \u2014 in itself a mammoth undertaking \u2014the IEA estimates 15 million a day of stockpile would still build up.When oil last collapsed five years ago it was America\u2019s shale producers who took the immediate hit because of their sensitivity to price swings, and the nation\u2019s industry is set to be battered again. Pipeline operators have asked drillers in Texas to ratchet back output.This time round everyone is sharing the pain. About 7 million barrels of daily output due to be shipped next month by a range of exporters is \u201chomeless,\u201d with \u201cliterally nowhere to go,\u201d consultant JBC Energy GmbH estimates.Production is starting to buckle everywhere.IHS Markit expects as much as 10 million barrels a day of output to be shut-in from April through June as storage fills up. In Canada, Athabasca Oil Corp. suspended some oilsands operations and Suncor Energy Inc. said last month it will partly shut some of its fields.Brazil\u2019s Petrobras is paring production by 200,000 barrels a day. Landlocked Chad in Africa has halted two fields, and Ecuador, Citigroup Inc. said, \u201cisn\u2019t able to sell its crude anywhere to anybody.\u201dProducers who are operating offshore, or have access to coastal terminals, possess the widest options to reroute their barrels and will be the most \u201cimmune,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Currie said. Those \u201csitting behind thousands of miles of pipe\u201d are the most exposed.Russia VulnerableRussia, despite having helped initiate the global price war, is among those particularly vulnerable to its fallout. As sales from ports and its Druzhba pipeline melt away, the country could be incapable of selling about 1 million barrels a day of its output, according to Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citi.Neighbours such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, both far away from their customers, face \u201csevere offtake issues,\u201d said David Wech, an analyst at JBC Energy in Vienna.While logistics are critical, oil\u2019s collapse is simply making some production unprofitable. At US$25 a barrel crude, about 5 per cent of global production is losing money, according to the IEA.Companies are also slashing spending. BP Plc will invest less in its U.S. shale operations this year as it looks to reduce expenditure by about US$5 billion, lowering production. Some North Sea fields just aren\u2019t economical at current oil prices.\u201cIn the short-term, low prices will decrease supply by incentivizing reduced production,\u201d said Paul Horsnell, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc.Emerging WinnerAmid the carnage, there may still be a winner. Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin and the main architect of the bruising price war, can pump crude from its vast fields at less than US$10 a barrel. It also has access to plentiful storage around the world \u2014 from Egypt to Japan.Riyadh is flooding the market with crude as it threatens to pump at record high levels, contributing to oil\u2019s rout and forcing producers to consider an output agreement.The kingdom is convening an emergency online gathering of the OPEC+ coalition on Monday. The meeting is open to producers worldwide, including the U.S. If America were to join coordinated production cuts, that would be an unprecedented move away from the country\u2019s free-market ethics.But there are no guarantees that a deal can be reached. And even if an expanded alliance is made and the currently discussed 10 million barrels a day of cuts are agreed, it would ultimately be insufficient in the face of such an enormous glut.\u201cThe market is going to be shutting stuff down whether you like it or not,\u201d said Jan Stuart, global energy economist at Cornerstone Macro LLC. \u201cThat horse has left the barn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Reade Pickert", "title": "U.S. jobs plunge 701,000 in March, seven times what economists were expecting", "description": "First decline since 2010", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-payrolls-fall-701000-in-march-ahead-of-surge-in-layoffs", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/closed.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 3, 2020 9:00 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. employment plummeted last month in the first decline since 2010, offering an initial look at the widespread devastation the coronavirus pandemic has already begun to wreak on the once-strong labour market.Payrolls fell 701,000 from the prior month \u2014 compared with the median forecast of economists for a 100,000 decline \u2014 according to Labor Department data Friday that mainly cover the early part of March, even before government-mandated shutdowns forced firms to lay off millions more workers.

It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said.

The move comes after oil was already climbing following China\u2019s instruction to government agencies to start buying cheap crude for its strategic reserves.Despite the U.S. president\u2019s optimism, Saudi Arabia hasn\u2019t appeared to relent on its bid to flood the market yet, saying on Wednesday it was pumping at a record and had this week loaded almost 19 million barrels of oil in a single day. Meanwhile, Russia has said it\u2019s not satisfied with the oil price.If collective action does remove 10 million barrels a day from the market, that would be the equivalent of about 10 per cent of world demand prior to the impact of coronavirus crisis.That may not be enough to stop the pain that\u2019s rippled across the energy industry as demand craters with the coronavirus outbreak shutting down economies around the world, according to Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura.

Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc., which specializes in hauling gear to offshore drilling sites and production platforms, disclosed Wednesday that it\u2019s negotiating a plan with creditors to ease a US$1.2 billion debt burden. The company is planning a Chapter 11 filing.On Wednesday, Denver-based Whiting faced the maturity of US$262 million in convertible-notes . Whiting filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in the Southern District of Texas, listing debt of US$3.6 billion and assets worth US$7.6 billion in its bankruptcy petition.Even before the viral pandemic sent crude prices tumbling to the lowest in almost two decades, Whiting was struggling and never fully recovered from the last market crash of 2014-2016. In December 2015, as crude prices were just weeks from dipping to a 13-year low, Canaccord analyst Stephen Berman listed Whiting among a group of potential \u201ccomeback kids\u201d in the U.S. shale industry.US$20 OilWhen former Anadarko Petroleum Corp. executive Brad Holly took the reins as Whiting\u2019s chief in late 2017, oil prices were rising and at one point breached US$75 a barrel. But the debt load remained stubbornly high, prompting Holly last year to fire one-third of his workforce and scale back production targets after posting an unexpected quarterly loss.Oil now trades around US$20 a barrel, well below the US$50 level that Cowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum estimates Whiting requires to stay afloat. The company, which had a market capitalization of US$11 billion in 2014, was valued at about US$62 million as of Tuesday. Whiting\u2019s bankruptcy filing followed that of shale drillers Alta Mesa Resources Inc. and Sanchez Energy Corp., which sought protection last year.Moelis & Co. is Whiting\u2019s financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is its legal adviser and Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser.The case is Whiting Petroleum Corporation, 20-32021, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from coronavirus, job posting data suggests", "description": "Postings in Canada down 24%, while only 15% in U.S.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hiring-in-canada-drops-more-than-u-s-job-postings-data-show?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/montreal.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 1, 2020 8:20 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from the pandemic, according to a report by Indeed.com.Postings in Canada for the week ended March 27 were down 24 per cent from the same time last year, the job board website said in a report on Tuesday.

The large Canadian banks matched those moves by cutting their prime rates, which influence borrowing rates for variable mortgages and credit lines, to 2.45 per cent from 3.95 per cent at the start of the month.As those rates have dropped, banks have been eliminating discounts off prime on variable mortgages. At the start of the month, qualified borrowers could get a rate of prime minus 1 per cent from HSBC Canada, for example, while Canada\u2019s large domestic lenders were also offering \u201cprime minus\u201d deals as well.But those discounts have shrunk by 75 to 85 basis points, said Rob McLister, founder of mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com.Funding CostsTypical five-year fixed rates at also rising.

Preferred borrowers can still get some prime minus deals at big banks, but they\u2019re more like prime minus 10 or 15 basis points.McLister said the rising cost of short-term funding, used for variable mortgages, explains the jump. Spreads are wide, fewer people want to lend big banks money at preferable pricing, so that gets passed through to the borrower, McLister said.Fixed-rate mortgages, which are tied more to swings in the bond market, are also creeping up after Canadian bond yields hit record lows earlier in the month, added Cooper.\u201cThe banks just can\u2019t afford to price their loans at what are de minimis bond yield levels,\u201d Cooper said.She expects banks to start charging prime plus a premium for variable loans, as well as higher rates for fixed mortgages than those seen earlier in the year.\u201cI believe mortgage rates will trend around current levels,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t think interest rates in general are going to be a lot higher in the next year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Joel Rosenblatt", "title": "Robinhood accused of offering $75 credit to squelch lawsuit over trading platform crash", "description": "Online brokerage denies trying to block customers from joining class action", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/robinhood-accused-of-offering-credits-to-squelch-suit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stocks-14.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 3:52 PM EDT", "content": "Robinhood, facing lawsuits over crashes on its trading platform amid violent stock market swings, is now being accused of offering a \u201c$75 goodwill credit\u201d to dupe customers into waiving their legal rights.Attorneys for users who are suing the beleaguered online brokerage company asked a federal judge in Florida to order Robinhood to stop sending \u201cmisleading communications\u201d and to void any releases already signed by customers.\u201cWe view this type of activity by Robinhood as a calculated attempt to wipe out users\u2019 class action claims without informing the users that they can instead participate in the class action should they so choose,\u201d lawyer Michael S.

Making cars is cool, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what we\u2019re doing.\u201dTrump\u2019s criticism of GM boiled down to the company asking the federal government to \u201cshow me the the money\u201d before it would put the venture into high gear, according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. In initial discussions with the administration, GM and its partner were seeking about US$250 million for Ventec and its components suppliers to get production moving. The government wanted to contribute a fraction of that, people familiar with the deliberations said.\u201cYou can\u2019t get to the finish line unless you first go to the starting gate,\u201d Navarro, who was appointed last week to coordinate actions under the Defense Production Act, said in an email to Bloomberg News.Stop the SpreadThe sprint started with exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called Stop the Spread. It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to COVID-19. The group is led by retired American Express Co. Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson, founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc.Making cars is cool, but it doesn't compare to what we're doingGerald Johnson \n \nThey asked Barra\u2019s team what they needed to make ventilators. GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force.For his part, Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise, factories and a workforce to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals.Exponential GrowthManagers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help Ventec go from building a maximum of 250 ventilators a month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year. The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year. It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic\u2019s early weeks.\u201cThey produce millions of cars a year in the U.S.,\u201d Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks said of GM. \u201cWe produce hundreds of ventilators a month. They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale.\u201dThe next day, Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in. Kudlow, one of the administration\u2019s primary pitchmen, floated the idea on television. He cited GM as an example of a company that was stepping up \u201con a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons.\u201d\n\nVOCSN Multi-Function Ventilators, which integrate five separate medical devices, are seen at Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer that has seen a large increase in demand since the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak began, in Bothell, Washington.\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters\n\nBut GM was still studying how to make it happen. On March 19, Phil Kinley, vice president of manufacturing and labour and the plant-floor leader of the project, flew with engineers to Ventec\u2019s site in Washington, Johnson said. Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator\u2019s 700 parts to GM\u2019s Tech Center in Warren, north of Detroit.GM\u2019s purchasing team went to work, Johnson said. They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows to wipers. They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses. By March 22, GM had most parts lined up.\u201cThe supply base really stepped up,\u201d Johnson said.Painstaking AssemblyThe VOCSN, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017, is primarily used for critical-care ventilation. It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient, and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs, secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep the patient\u2019s chest clear.The company boasts on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment. To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven, a GM assembly plant was ill suited. The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of a Buick. Making a ventilator is more like building a watch: Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs.That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo, Indiana. It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines.\n\nAn employee works on final assembly of VOCSN Multi-Function Ventilators at Ventec Life Systems.\n\nAn employee works on final assembly of VOCSN Multi-Function Ventilators at Ventec Life Systems.\n\nThe facility has 300 on staff and will need 1,000 to achieve the production levels GM and Ventec want to reach. The carmaker has started evaluating new hires and is seeking volunteers among the staff idled by the shutdown of parts production in Kokomo and metal stamping in nearby Marion, Indiana.GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process, Johnson said.\u201cThis is truly a major step at a critical moment,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime watcher of Detroit\u2019s automakers. \u201cGM was written off and appears to be coming through.\u201dMoney MattersGM and Ventec now need to decide how the units will be distributed and paid for. Negotiations continue with the government, which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to people familiar with the matter.That assumes a deal gets done. To the surprise of GM and Ventec, Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing. He tweeted that GM officials \u201cwant top dollar.\u201dGM said it\u2019s building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec, which is the major player in negotiations with the government. The machines normally cost about US$18,000 apiece, while some ventilators can run as high as US$50,000.Another benefit of Ventec\u2019s VOCSN is it replaces four other pieces of hardware typically needed for acute respiratory care. Using it could lower costs for hospitals because they won\u2019t need to buy oxygenators, nebulizers and devices to clear the lungs.When Trump complained last week about pricing, people in the GM-Ventec venture thought that the device\u2019s five-in-one therapy capabilities may not have been completely understood. People familiar with negotiations said there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline, and they were caught off guard when the president complained.As negotiations go on, GM and Ventec say they are progressing fast. \u201cThe responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need,\u201d Brooks said.There\u2019s already been a change in sentiment from Trump. At his press briefing on Sunday, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we have to worry about General Motors now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello, Jacqueline Thorpe, Kevin Orland and Danielle Bochove", "title": "Scenes from a shutdown: How Canadian workers are facing the COVID-19 slump", "description": "From Calgary to Montreal, here are their tales", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadian-workers-covid-19-shutdown-impact", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-courier.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 11:00 AM EDT", "content": "They\u2019d just bet millions on a hotel makeover, were waiting tables while pursuing their dream, or toiling in an already tough oil market.Canadians have seen their world upended in a matter of days as the coronavirus shuts down huge swaths of the economy.

The U.S. president spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 9 about the dispute.Trump has long argued that improving relations between Washington and Moscow could help solve international disputes. The president said he wanted to discuss trade with Putin, though he said he expected the Russian president to raise objections to U.S. sanctions. State-run Tass quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Putin didn\u2019t ask Trump for sanctions relief on the call.Oil tumbled earlier to its lowest point in nearly two decades, heading for the worst quarter on record as coronavirus lockdowns cascaded through the world\u2019s largest economies, leaving the market overwhelmed by cratering demand and a ballooning surplus.

The price is so lowU.S. President Donald Trump \n \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates consumption will drop by 26 million barrels a day this week. Meanwhile, Riyadh and Moscow are showing no signs of a detente in their supply battle as Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase its oil exports in the coming months, despite U.S. warnings against flooding the market.Some analysts argue Russia\u2019s motivations extend well beyond oil and are complicated by the federation\u2019s anger over U.S. sanctions and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking Russia to Germany. And the price for getting Russia to back down could be too high.\u201cRussia\u2019s concerns with the U.S. go beyond market share. Putin is frustrated with sanctions and may be more interested in punishing the U.S. than Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and chief executive of drilling services company Canary LLC. \u201cIf Trump wants an agreement with Putin, he may have to promise to ease up on sanctions. I am not sure he can deliver without the backing of congress.\u201dRosneft PJSC over the weekend sold its assets in Venezuela to the Russian government, a move that shields the Russian oil giant from further U.S. sanctions while keeping Moscow behind the regime of Nicolas Maduro. Fears of broader sanctions have grown after the U.S. in recent months slapped restrictions on Rosneft trading companies for handling business with Venezuela.Talks between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies broke down in early March as Russia refused to sign on to larger production cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia. The failure to reach an agreement prompted the Saudis to unleash a price war which, combined with the devastating effect of the virus pandemic, caused the market to crash.Global demand is slumping by as much as 20 million barrels a day, about 20 per cent, as billions of people go into lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. The outlook remains dire, with traders, banks and analysts forecasting a huge oversupply as governments effectively shut their economies.Oil industry leaders, trade groups and some Republican senators have pressed the Trump administration to seek a diplomatic solution with Saudi Arabia. Six senators from oil-producing states last week urged Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to take a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia, while highlighting several \u201cpowerful tools at our disposal,\u201d including sanctions, tariffs and other trade restrictions.\u201cTrump would have better success pressing Saudi Arabia than Russia since they are dependent on the U.S. for protection, intelligence and arms sales,\u201d Eberhart said.On the coronavirus, the two sides expressed concern about the scale of its spread, according to the Kremlin.

With coronavirus cases in the U.S. on the rise since then, and more parts of the country shutting down businesses and limiting travel, consumption has likely slid further.Valero Energy Corp. has reduced processing rates across about half of its refineries, and Phillips 66 said many of its refineries are near minimum rates.

The great crash of 1929, the twin oil shocks of the 1970s and the global financial crisis don\u2019t come close. The world normally uses 100 million barrels of oil day, and traders and analysts reckon as much as a quarter of that has disappeared in just a few weeks.The global airline industry is grounded, countless businesses and factories are shuttered and billions of people have been forced to stay home.\u201cDemand clearly is off, in some parts of the world, very dramatically,\u201d Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg TV.The immediate problem is a lack of storage in the right places. With demand running 20 million barrels a day below supply, the world won\u2019t have enough tanks to store the surplus in two or three months. But the issue is even more pressing because global tank capacity, mostly concentrated in a few hubs like Rotterdam, the Caribbean and Singapore, isn\u2019t available to every producer. For those without access to pipelines and ports, local storage will run out in days, traders and consultants say.\n\nOil storage tanks in Mexico.\n\nEdgard Garrido/Reuters files\n\nFor those with access to the coast, one solution is to use the supertanker fleet as floating storage tanks, and that\u2019s happening at an unprecedented rate. The CEO of the world\u2019s largest tanker owner, Frontline Ltd., said on Friday that he\u2019d never known such demand to hire ships for long-term storage. Traders could put 100 million barrels at sea, he estimated, but even that accounts for just a few days\u2019 oversupply.In the U.S., one of the largest pipeline companies, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has asked oil producers to voluntarily cut output to avoid overwhelming the network that connects well heads to refineries through thousands of miles of pipelines.The world is running out of places to put oil because the shutdown of vast swathes of the economy has been catastrophic for demand. The collapse in commercial air travel has cut jet fuel use by up to 75 per cent, or almost 5 million barrels a day.As for gasoline, American drivers are the single biggest source of demand, using more than 9 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. As whole states, including California and New York, have told people to stay home, billions of car journeys have been lost. It\u2019s a pattern repeated in Europe and Asia.\u201cDemand destruction is unprecedented,\u201d said Ben Luckock, co-head of trading at Trafigura Group, the second-largest independent oil trader. He estimates the hit to consumption will total 22 million barrels a day in April.We are facing a catastrophic loss of demandGary Ross \n \nAround the world, about 700 refineries turn crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. They are starting to dial down production and even shut outright because demand for the fuel they produce is so dire. In India, for example, where 1.3 billion people are under lockdown until mid-Aptil, the nation\u2019s biggest refinery has cut processing rates at most plants by as much as 30 per cent.A small refiner in Italy, the epicentre of Europe\u2019s virus outbreak, shut on Friday because demand for fuel plunged 85 per cent.As the refining system withers, the crude oil market is suffering. Many crudes, especially sticky, sulfurous grades that refiners find hard to process, trade at hefty discounts to international benchmarks. Western Canadian Select, a tarry blend squeezed from Alberta\u2019s oilsands, reached a record low of US$4.51 a barrel on Friday.\n\nA Suncor Inc. oilsands operation in Alberta.\n\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg files\n\nIn the U.S., Oklahoma Sour is changing hands at US$5.75, Nebraska Intermediate at US$8, while Wyoming Sweet prices at US$3 a barrel.In one obscure corner of the American crude market, prices have already turned negative. Wyoming Asphalt Sour, a dense oil used mostly to produce paving bitumen, was bid at minus 19 cents a barrel in mid-March by Trading Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.The surprise, perhaps, is that benchmark futures are still trading as high as they are. Brent, the North Sea grade that sets the price for about two-thirds of the world\u2019s oil, ended last week at US$24.93 a barrel, well above the historic low of US$9.55 a barrel in 1998.Luckock at Trafigura says future prices are likely to fall another US$10. Black Gold\u2019s Ross also says Brent and the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will be trading in the teens within days.The next stage of the oil market\u2019s meltdown will be widespread production shutdowns as drillers decide the only option is to leave it in the ground until better days return.

Treasuries gained and oil slipped.The S&P 500 Index climbed 10 per cent this week, its biggest gain since March 2009, on the strength of a record three-day rally. But that rally sputtered Friday, and the benchmark plunged just minutes before the close, illustrating how tenuous any gains can be, even with a US$2 trillion spending deal heading to the president\u2019s desk for his signature. The S&P remains 25 per cent below its February record, and the Cboe Volatility Index is on track for a 10th straight close above 60. It averaged 18.7 in the past year.

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic. Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India on Friday became the latest central bank to step up emergency action to cushion the economic impact.\u201cIt is by no means a given that volatility has ceased to be a feature of global equity markets,\u201d said Paul Markham, global equities portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. \u201cMarkets will oscillate between the reassurance that governments and central banks will be standing by to support them and the uncertainty of both the duration and depth of what will undoubtedly be a significant economic impact.\u201dThese are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index decreased 3.4% as of 4 p.m. New York time.

A handful of experts is saying that will happen again.The comeback trail would be steep and long. The spread of coronavirus is crushing demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia are creating a glut. Everybody agrees U.S. production will take a bigger hit than last time, when it dipped before soaring. As many as 70% of the 6,000 shale drillers may go bankrupt, and one-third of shale-patch workers are expected to lose their jobs. Wall Street, which financed the last boom, has cut off the cash spigot.But some experts are saying the future, however far off, will be better. They\u2019re looking past the dire forecasts and vertical chart lines and cautioning against despair. They\u2019re echoing a widespread view that\u2019s mostly unspoken during the market meltdown: Yes, America can shock the world again. The boom-and-bust cycle will shift, and shale is in a position, with its infrastructure, its ability to ramp-up quickly and its plentiful reserves, to rise from the ashes stronger than ever.When the dust settles in the Permian Basin and other American shale fields, the survivors will be leaner and more tech savvy, according to Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit Ltd. That means lower production costs and a greater ability to respond to the next price rebound with the last thing Moscow and Riyadh want \u2014 another boom.\u201cCompanies go bankrupt, but rocks don\u2019t go bankrupt,\u201d Yergin said in an interview. \u201cWhen this all shakes out, there will be other people to develop shale.\u201dNoah Barrett also believes the growth engine of U.S. crude production will be humbled, but won\u2019t flicker out. That\u2019s because shale has extensive infrastructure that isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201cThe resource is still there, the pipeline capacity, the processing capacity,\u201d said Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. \u201cThose are still there.\u201dEven if predictions are correct, that overall American oil output will slide to 8 million or 9 million barrels a day, down about one-third from the current 13 million, the U.S. would still count among the world\u2019s very top producers, Barrett said.Bloomberg Intelligence is forecasting a more-modest production falloff of about 1.5 million barrels a day.The weakest companies \u201cwill go into stronger hands,\u201d said Vincent G. Piazza, BI\u2019s senior oil analyst. \u201cThe industry is going to be in a lot better shape than in 2014-2016. The balance sheet is in a lot better shape. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the ability of this industry to re-create itself.\u201dFereidun Fesharaki is a shale believer, too. The chairman of global energy consultant FGE said he also expects the price squeeze to force explorers to become more efficient and cost-competitive.Still, any rays of optimism must penetrate a very dense, dark cloud. In the market cataclysm that\u2019s still unfolding, crude and fuel prices around the world have sunk to levels not seen in nearly two decades.As if by evil magic, the Covid-19 outbreak has chased tens of millions of people from streets, stores, factories and travel hubs, suddenly degrading demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel across the world\u2019s largest economies.Veteran crude analyst Roger Diwan expects global consumption to plunge by more than 14 million barrels a day \u2014 the biggest demand shock since the birth of the oil age. The pipeline that hauls 60% of the East Coast\u2019s gasoline supply from the Gulf Coast is cutting capacity by one-fifth. In Chicago, wholesale gasoline tumbled to 15 cents a gallon, the lowest since at least 1992.The virus-driven calamity has been compounded by the disintegration earlier this month of the Russia-Saudi cooperation pact that capped global crude supplies. Because of the rapidly expanding worldwide glut of crude, a barrel of oil in some parts of Texas recently fetched about $16. In Canada, oil traded for less than $10.The price plunge instantly made thousands of prospective shale sites money-losing propositions. Companies have been in such a hurry to cut losses that some have paid early-termination penalties on rigs and other gear to halt work before contracts are up.Slashing SpendingEven Chevron Corp. is retrenching. The California giant, widely recognized as holding some of the richest acreage in the Permian, said Tuesday it was slashing spending by $4 billion and halting share buybacks to conserve cash.In the final three months of 2019, nine explorers and six service companies filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone LLC. That represented $13.5 billion in debt. This year\u2019s churn is just getting started. Mizuho Securities analyst Paul Sankey expects as many as 70% of the 6,000 or so shale drillers to go bankrupt before the cycle turns.But private-equity firms that swooped in to buy ailing explorers and tempting assets during the last bust won\u2019t be able to unfurl a safety net this time. The buy-and-flip model that underpinned their foray into shale has disappeared, forcing those firms to become oilfield operators, which in turn means tapping their own credit facilities, said Ian Rainbolt, vice president of finance at Warwick Energy Group, the biggest owner of non-operated U.S. shale assets.Only about one-third of the Permian and other U.S. fields count as sweet spots that can harvest oil profitably at $30 a barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate traded at $21.42 on Friday.\u201cPrivate equity\u2019s going to be out of the game,\u201d Rainbolt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tough fund-raising market.\u201dIn the meantime, service providers \u2014 the hired hands of the oil industry who do everything from stack steel pipes to frack wells \u2014 will experience extreme pressure, along with the explorers who are demanding price cuts, said Stacey Morris, director of research at Alerian, an indexing and research company. Pipeline owners are somewhat insulated because oil and natural gas still need to be shipped to refiners and export terminals, she said.Shale Threshold\u201cThe market is going to be out of balance for quite some time,\u201d Morris said.Yergin, the confidante of oil ministers and chief executives, sees the threshold for reinvigorating shale between $50 and $60 a barrel. U.S. crude was trading above the $50 level as recently as Feb. 26.\u201cAt $50, we\u2019ll start to see a recovery and a step up in investment, so long as people feel safe about the price floor beneath them,\u201d he said.It\u2019s funny that Yergin should put it that way. A big part of shale\u2019s resilience lies in its unique geology. Unlike the so-called conventional fields in Saudi Arabia and Russia, North American shale is rock so dense that it doesn\u2019t degrade or collapse on itself if oil production is interrupted. In other parts of the world, disrupting output can do irreversible damage.That\u2019s why the bulk of Chevron\u2019s $4 billion spending cut will take place in the Permian, CEO Mike Wirth said Tuesday. It\u2019s a rare field where production can be turned off almost instantly without adverse long-term impacts.With shale, \u201cthe assets don\u2019t go away because you haven\u2019t destroyed the field,\u201d said Ken Medlock, senior director of Rice University\u2019s Center for Energy Studies. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a thinning of the herd but the assets will still be there.\u201d\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Bank of Canada cuts rate for third time to 0.25% in bid to shield economy from coronavirus fallout", "description": "The last time the rate was this low was the global financial crisis", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/breaking-bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-emergency-move?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/boc-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 27, 2020 11:15 AM EDT", "content": "The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks and announced plans to acquire more commercial paper and government securities to help shield the nation\u2019s economy from coronavirus fallout.The central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound. The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history. \nBank of Canada lowers interest rate: Read the official statement\nPolicy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz announced two new programs: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program and the buying of Canadian government securities in the secondary market.

The small Kansas plant in the heart of rural America was offering just $1.75 a barrel for Wyoming sweet crude.With more than two billion people on virus lockdown from India to California, energy demand has plunged. In corners of the U.S., Canada, Russia and China, oil prices at the well-head are collapsing under the weight of an unprecedented glut.And with it, the industry is bracing for something that last happened on this scale 35 years ago: producers shutting down their wells as pumping crude makes no economic sense.\u201cI have never seen anything like this in the markets,\u201d said Torbjorn Tornqvist, the co-founder of Gunvor Group Ltd., a large commodity trading house. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything even close to today.\u201dThe oil market \u2014 hit by the double blow of a demand slump and a supply surge as Saudi Arabia and Russia wage a price war \u2014 is battling a surplus of as much as 20% of global consumption.The consequences are brutal: prices are now low enough to force a widespread suspension of production, or a shut-in as it\u2019s known in the industry. For those waging the price war, it counts as a victory \u2014 as long as the shut-ins happen elsewhere.Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarks closely followed in Wall Street, are hovering around $25 a barrel. But in the world of physical oil \u2014 where actual barrels change hands \u2014 producers are getting much less.The industry is navigating what Paul Sankey, a veteran oil analyst at Mizuho Bank Ltd, described as \u201cuncharted waters to unknown lands.\u201dWyoming Sweet, a landlocked crude with few outlets other than American refineries like Coffeyville, is paradigmatic of how the dynamics of the oil market are forcing output cuts. There are others: North Dakota Light Sweet has traded at $9.97 a barrel. Across the border, Western Canadian Select has plunged to $6.45. In Siberia, Russian crude has changed hands for less than $10 and Chinese domestic prices have fallen to single digits.Ultra-low oil prices are starting to work: Petrobras, the Brazilian state-run producer, is cutting output by 100,000 barrels a day from high-cost offshore platforms. Glencore Plc., the commodity giant, is shutting down its oilfields in Chad. In Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. has partially shutdown its Fort Hills oil sands mine.As the pain spreads, industry executives believe many other companies will stem production in the next few days.\u201cWe need to cut crude supply by 10 million barrels a day pretty quickly,\u201d said Russel Hardy, the head of top independent oil trader Vitol Group. \u201cOil prices will need to go lower, to bring the prices to a level that triggers a response.\u201dThe last time the oil industry faced widespread shut-ins was in 1986, when Saudi Arabia also ravaged the market in a price war. During the price battles of 1998-99 and 2015-16 the industry also saw cuts, but not on a large scale.Put simply, the world cannot continue pumping at the current level of about 100 million barrels a day while demand is as much as 20% lower. The surplus would overwhelm storage capacity within weeks.In some emerging markets, where infrastructure is less developed, it\u2019s already happening. Pakistan has told refiners to stop importing gasoline and diesel as the tanks are already brimming.Rush to SeaWhere there\u2019s access to the sea, traders use tankers to store oil \u2014 and wait for prices to go up. Crude is now moving onto ships at a record pace, according to one of the industry\u2019s largest shipowners.But inland, producers are reliant on sending crude to local refineries like Coffeyville and the lack of storage capacity will be decisive.\u201cThe surge in inventory in coming weeks will inevitably saturate local infrastructure, in our view, forcing many inland producers to shut-in wells,\u201d said Damien Courvalin, oil analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Some producers will prefer to take the hit of negative prices \u2014 paying someone to take the oil off their hands \u2014 to the long-term costs of shutting down a well. In the aftermath of the last major downturn, a North Dakota sour crude went to a negative 50 cents.But as storage fills up, production will have to respond. IHS Markit Ltd., a consultant, estimates the Canadian province of Alberta has inland tanks able to store the equivalent of just 3.2 days of daily production. The central U.S., which includes Wyoming, has room for just 12.8 days\u2019 output.\u201cProduction is going to have to be reduced or even shut in,\u201d said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets at IHS Markit. \u201cIt is now a matter of where and by how much.\u201d\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kait Bolongaro, Doug Alexander and Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Trudeau, banks in talks on relief package for small business", "description": "The Finance department has been in talks with Canadian lenders this week on a plan to provide emergency help for small businesses", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trudeau-banks-in-talks-on-relief-package-for-small-business", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bill-morneau.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 6:52 PM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s finance department is working with the nation\u2019s banks on a relief package for small business, according to people familiar with the talks.The department has been in talks with Canadian lenders this week on a plan to provide emergency help for small businesses that have been hurt by shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing the government\u2019s plans.So far, Ottawa has made $10 billion in credit available as well as a wage subsidy to help small businesses keep employees on the payroll. \nCanadian heavy oil cheaper than a pint of beer as North American demand for fuel plummets\nhttps://business.financialpost.com/commodities/canadian-heavy-oil-cheaper-than-a-pint-of-beer-as-north-american-demand-for-fuel-plummets\nCanada ramps up asset buying to backstop coronavirus-slammed economy\nThe credit package was announced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau on March 13, but since then the economy has deteriorated.

In the U.S, the so-called WTI cash roll traded down at the lowest level since December 2008 on expectations that inventories at the delivery point for U.S. futures would balloon in coming weeks and months.Brent futures are trading deep in a contango structure where spot prices are at discount to those in later months as the market tries to create the necessary financial incentives to store by pressuring near-term prices.Measures of the physical market for actual barrels of crude are also pointing to weakness globally.Of the world\u2019s three largest oil producers, Russia has the least amount of available storage capacity at about eight days, IHS said.

The Bank of Canada is likely to follow with its first foray into so-called quantitative easing soon, according to market watchers at Canada\u2019s largest banks.Although the central bank has already announced several programs aimed at unclogging credit markets, strategists expect Governor Stephen Poloz will need to introduce formal, large-scale asset purchases to keep borrowing costs low amid the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of workers. \nOttawa asks banks, credit-card companies to lower interest rates\n\u2018We will overcome this:\u2019 G20 leaders vow to strengthen global financial safety net\nJack M. Mintz: Canada needs to think BIG now to avoid a long, deep recession\n\u201cMore stimulus is needed because of the size of the output gap, and the credit market stresses mean that QE is the ideal way of providing that stimulus,\u201d Andrew Kelvin, senior Canada rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said by email.Over the past several weeks, both the Bank of Canada and the government have announced programs aimed at pumping cash into the financial system. They\u2019ve done so by buying up billions of dollars in debt so banks can continue to lend to individuals and businesses in need during the pandemic.QE ExpectationsToronto-Dominion predicts a two-part quantitive easing program totalling $150 billion. This includes mostly purchases of Government of Canada bonds but also a smaller number of mortgage bonds. TD expects the first portion of the QE program \u2014 between $50 billion and $75 billion \u2014 to be announced at the central bank\u2019s April 15 meeting, and the second in the third quarter, according to Kelvin.Strategists at Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expect a large-asset-purchase program of around $100 billion. However, it has the potential to grow from there.\u201cThe BoC will likely start with something under $100 billion, but that would quickly ramp up, especially if CMB and provincial spreads continue to widen,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, rates and macro strategist at BMO, said by email.Next MovesThe Bank of Canada still has the highest policy rate among its Group of Seven counterparts, at 0.75 per cent. Typically, QE programs are reserved for when rates are at or near zero, and a central bank needs some other tool to keep rates low. So, the expectation on the street is that the Bank of Canada will introduce a QE program once it lowers interest rates to 0.25 per cent.\u201cThere is no preset sequence for implementing unconventional policy \u2014 but we expect the first round of asset purchases to be announced ahead of, or in conjunction with, a move to 0.00 per cent for the overnight rate,\u201d Kelvin said in a note to clients.Most economists expect the bank to lower interest rates to 0.25 per cent by its April 15 meeting.The Bank of Canada has never in its history introduced a large-scale asset purchase program. During the financial crisis, it used forward guidance to bolster market confidence. But the extraordinary economic circumstance caused by the pandemic has investors calling for unconventional tools.A formal quantitative easing announcement by the Bank of Canada would follow its international peers. The U.S. and the two Antipodean countries have embarked on such efforts.\u201cWe can conceivably see the Bank of Canada attempting to size their QE program to be smaller than the Fed but somewhat larger than both Australia and New Zealand,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Ian Pollick wrote in a note.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's big banks have already fielded 213,000 requests for mortgage deferrals", "description": "Banks are reporting higher volumes of calls related to mortgages and other loans, along with requests for deferrals", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadas-big-banks-field-213000-requests-for-mortgage-deferrals?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/banks-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 26, 2020 10:28 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s biggest banks have fielded hundreds of thousands of requests from homeowners seeking to hold off making mortgage payments under a new coronavirus-related relief plan.More than 213,000 requests to defer payments have been completed or are being processed since the country\u2019s six largest banks announced the plan last week, Mathieu Labreche, a spokesman for the Canadian Bankers Association, said Thursday in an interview.\u201cThe large number of customers that have been helped continues to grow as the result of concerted efforts by front-line workers, contact-centre agents and operations teams working diligently,\u201d he said. \nManulife to offer mortgage, credit card relief to those affected by COVID-19\nConsumer watchdog keeping close eye on banks\u2019 offer of coronavirus mortgage relief\nBig banks to allow delayed mortgage payments to some in unprecedented response to coronavirus crisis\nRoyal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and three other large lenders announced plans on March 17 to provide financial relief to Canadians impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, with mortgage deferrals among the measures introduced.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn\u2019t require members to travel to Washington \u2014 as long as the bill does not have any \u201cpoison pills\u201d Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the \u201cthe president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation\u2019s economy as we work through this crisis.\u201dThe size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation\u2019s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third \u2014 and biggest \u2014 plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial US$8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing.

Goldman said the Fed\u2019s move would help alleviate the funding stress that\u2019s driven gold lower, and investors would now pivot to focus on the expansion of its balance sheet, just as they did in 2008.

Many see it as inevitable that Poloz and his governing council will cut the overnight rate to near zero, then start rummaging deeper into their toolbox.\u201cWe think the bank will be forced to adopt QE and that they\u2019ll look to ultimately buy up to $150 billion in securities,\u201d said TD Securities macro strategist Robert Both in an email. \u201cWe think it is a question of when and not if.\u201dSharp Economic SlideQuantitative easing, which sees central banks buy government bonds as part of an effort to keep borrowing costs low for a prolonged period of time, would be a first for the Bank of Canada, which didn\u2019t follow its peers to such lengths during the 2008 crisis.The global outlook is deteriorating rapidly, forcing central banks into new territory.

It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed\u2019s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans. \nDavid Rosenberg: It\u2019s time for investors to start saying the D-word \u2014 this economic damage could be double 2008\nThis is what the Bank of Canada has left in its arsenal to fight the coronavirus downturn\nYour portfolio may be down 40%, but it could be worse if you owned these stocks\nFollowing a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.\u201cWow, just wow,\u201d George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you\u2019ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.\u201dIn a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed\u2019s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves. Signs of stress in the corporate debt sector eased, with the CDX Investment Grade index spread tightening. Bond ETFs eligible for central-bank purchases rallied and the dollar retreated versus major peers.Economic ShutdownMonday\u2019s Fed action followed an already-dizzying number of steps taken by Chairman Jerome Powell in the past three weeks that would have been unthinkable just months ago. They represent a dramatic reaction to the sudden stop inflicted on the economy by the contagion and by the subsequent panic among investors.Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs separately joined an emergency call to work on a joint response to the economic blow dealt by the pandemic.The U.S. economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.Not a \u2018Slush Fund\u2019\u201cThis is not a slush-fund,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market. That\u2019s on top of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. This is a massive liquidity program.\u201dBeyond the unlimited quantitative easing program, the new emergency facilities will employ a total of US$300 billion, backed by US$30 billion from the Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund.Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington, said he expects those facilities to grow substantially if Congress moves ahead with plans to pump more money into the ESF.The draft of an economic aid bill currently being hashed out on Capitol Hill included US$425 billion for the ESF to support Fed actions.The Fed\u2019s new credit facilities carry limits on paying dividends and making stock buybacks for firms that defer interest payments, but have no explicit restrictions preventing beneficiaries from laying off workers.The Fed said a week ago it would buy at least US$500 billion of Treasuries and US$200 billion of agency MBS. The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.\u201cThis is a great step forward,\u201d said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cGetting to the corporate bond market was critical. A lot of people needed to be clear the QE was unconstrained.\u201dOther HighlightsTwo more programs were created to support large employers \u2014 a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility for new bond and loan issuance, and a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. Yet another program, a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, will \u201cenable the issuance of asset-backed securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration and certain other assets. The central bank also said it would expand the existing Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, including municipal variable-rate demand notes Finally, the Fed said it would expand the existing Commercial Paper Funding Facility to also include high-quality municipal debt, another move to help cash-strapped states and cities. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s latest moves signal a resounding \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 approach from the central bank, and dispel any notion that monetary policy makers are either sparing ammunition or running out of unconventional tools,\u201d Andrew Husby and Carl Riccadonna, of Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note to clients.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jennifer Jacobs, Josh Wingrove and Saleha Mohsin", "title": "Trump wants to ease stay-at-home advice to curb economic rout from COVID-19", "description": "Trump and contingent of aides want to ensure economic damage from nationwide 'social distancing' doesn't outweigh potential toll from virus itself", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-wants-to-ease-advice-telling-people-to-stay-at-home-to-curb-economic-rout-from-covid-19?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trump.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 23, 2020 11:28 AM EDT", "content": "President Donald Trump began talking privately late last week about reopening the nation, despite the swiftly rising number of coronavirus cases and against the advice of health professionals, because he\u2019s worried about the economic damage from an extended shutdown, according to people familiar with his thinking.The shortage of testing kits has made it difficult to assess the full spread of the virus, but Trump and a contingent of his aides, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, want to ensure that the economic damage from a nationwide \u201csocial distancing\u201d campaign doesn\u2019t outweigh the potential toll from the virus itself, the people said.\u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.

That campaign would end about March 31.The discussions centred on what to do after the 15-day period ends, and how to test and isolate everyone who\u2019s sick so healthy people can return to work. It\u2019s likely the CDC guidelines would be relaxed rather than scrapped altogether, one person said.Birx, Fauci AdviceThe government\u2019s top health authorities have warned that in the absence of any viable medical treatment, sustained and economically painful restrictions on daily life are the only way to beat the virus. This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government\u2019s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House\u2019s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump\u2019s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard predicted the U.S. unemployment rate may hit 30 per cent in the second quarter, along with a 50 per cent drop in gross domestic product. Morgan Stanley said Sunday it expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.There had been more than 35,000 cases of the disease in the U.S. by Monday and more than 400 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Social distancing didn\u2019t begin with Trump\u2019s guidelines and won\u2019t necessarily end if he lifts them, as governors and municipal leaders have the power to issue \u201cshelter in place\u201d and other orders limiting daily life in virus-ravaged parts of the country.

The shutdowns are contributing to the growing conviction that the world has slipped into its first recession since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.\u201cThis is kind of a rolling natural disaster,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. \u201cIn terms of the impact on global production, the shutdown outside of China will likely become bigger than the impact from China.\u201dThe shock to supply chains, Harris said, is deeper and more sprawling than the trade wars of the past two years and likely to be more prolonged than the storms, earthquakes or floods that have been a source of stress for major industries in the past. He expects factory shutdowns will last into May and possibly longer.Compounding the blow for companies, the initial supply shock has become interwoven with a demand crisis in Europe, the U.S. and other major economies as workers and consumers are ordered to stay home.Apple SuppliersApple Inc., for example, is confronting the impact on component makers in Italy, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea after having weathered the February slowdown in Chinese factories that do the final assembly of products like iPhones and AirPods.In Malaysia, key suppliers like Murata Manufacturing Co., Renesas Electronics Corp. and Ibiden Co. have halted production as a result of restrictions on movements imposed by the government. Micron Technology Inc. is affected too, but said an exemption allows \u201climited semiconductor operations to continue.\u201d Texas Instruments Inc. and On Semiconductor Corp. also have facilities there.Peru\u2019s state of emergency and nationwide lockdown have led major mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Newmont Corp. to curb copper production there. The same is happening in other mining centers like Chile, Canada and Mongolia, with economists at Scotiabank saying the initial result from the hit in Chile and Peru alone leading to the loss of some 325,000 metric tons of copper production, or about 1.7% of global annual output.In Europe, industrial giants like Volkswagen AG and Airbus SE have shut down assembly lines in an effort both to reduce the spread of the virus and to deal with parts shortages and bottlenecks due to restrictions on travel within Europe.BottlenecksWhile governments in the region have pledged to safeguard the transport of goods as borders are shut to other nonessential travel, traffic disruptions have started to escalate. Trucks lined up for 40 miles near Berlin after the German border to Poland was closed, and diverting passenger cars to alternatives routes brought little relief.The car industry is particularly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Its fine-tuned logistics are designed to keep storage times to only between 1 and 2 months. The push into electric cars has added to complexity, because production of battery cells requires a steady flow of materials like lithium and cobalt.Germany\u2019s Schaeffler Group, which employs 87,000 worldwide and is a major supplier to car makers, joined peers on Thursday in hammering out emergency plans to cut capacity in Europe and avoid layoffs. Those include reducing working hours and cutting production on certain days.\u201cAs we have to reduce production in our plants in the light of the crisis, it was important to us that flexible solutions be quickly established,\u201d said Juergen Wechsler, who represents Schaeffler workers for union IG Metall.Liqui Moly GmbH, a maker of engine oil and lubricants based in the southern German city of Ulm, is suffering dramatic order declines. \u201cIf the situation demands it, I will forgo my salary,\u201d Chairman Ernst Prost said.Detroit ShutdownAnton Posner, chief executive officer of supply-chain management and consulting company Mercury Resources, said the move by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to temporarily shut down their U.S. plants will reverberate not only through their suppliers of finished parts but in steel, aluminum and transportation.\u201cWe have ships loading steel in Europe next week headed for the U.S., but will there be shipments beyond that with industry shutting down?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho\u2019s going to hold inventory if there\u2019s no consumption?\u201dU.S. steelmaker Commercial Metals says it\u2019s still at work and facing postponements, not yet cancellations. \u201cSo all these jobs are going to come back,\u201d said CEO Barbara Smith.She hasn\u2019t had any employees infected.

The executive went home, came back to work Monday, then left again with chest pains. Meanwhile, an associate who woke up with a fever worried about letting down bosses but stayed away.This wasn\u2019t a Goldman Sachs problem. Wall Street\u2019s nonstop aggressiveness is clashing with the demands of a deadly pandemic. As government officials, doctors and companies tell people around the world to stay home, interviews with bankers and traders inside the industry\u2019s giants show many feel torn between public health and private profit. \n\u2018I can only survive for a month\u2019: Gig economy workers hit first \u2014 and hardest \u2014 by COVID-19 crisis\nCoronavirus relief package likely not enough to stop widespread layoffs, some observers warn\nHow much damage can the coronavirus do to Canada\u2019s economy \u2014 and how we\u2019ll bounce back: BMO chief economist Doug Porter \u2014 podcast\n\u201cPeople do come in when they have a cold,\u201d said Jim Toes, who runs the Security Traders Association, an industry group. \u201cSometimes you have that old boss where you\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t: If you stay home, you get that snickering response. If you come in, you get in trouble.\u201dWall Street\u2019s blanket directives telling workers to stop coming in aren\u2019t as simple as they sound, especially for traders. One said he\u2019s facing pressure to be \u201ca tough guy\u201d who follows the unwritten wartime rules. If there\u2019s money to be made, the trader said, his bosses would want him in the position to make it, even if there\u2019s a healthier and more soulful message being broadcast by the bank\u2019s chief executive officer.Some bankers even said privately they would be relieved if markets temporarily shut, especially because they worry the new work-from-home policies aren\u2019t as robust as they sound.Goldman senior executives have urged employees who are feeling ill to stay home. \u201cIf you are not feeling well, you must stay home even if your symptoms are mild,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Laurence Stein said in a Sunday memo. \u201cTake sick time or work from home until your symptoms have subsided.\u201dThe culture that\u2019s so ingrained across the top of Wall Street reaches far past Midtown Manhattan. Its impact can be felt among bank tellers who have no choice but to report to branches, or even white-collar workers in the Midwest.And while the health crisis finds about 100 million Americans without the luxury of working from home, the difference at banks is the degree of disparity that can be seen inside some of the industry\u2019s largest firms. Many highly paid executives are able to log in from home, but operators still report to call centres. Workers in between feel confused and stuck.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., the country\u2019s biggest bank, some managers are making workers come in despite announcements from more senior bosses to stay home, according to people with knowledge of the matter. After a senior mortgage executive told employees on a call that underwriters with remote access should start working from home, a subordinate stopped many of them from telecommuting in Milwaukee, where schools are shut.\n\nA pedestrian walks past a JPMorgan Chase & Co. bank branch in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg files\n\nFrom their windows, JPMorgan employees there watched workers in Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s nearby building haul computer monitors and keyboards to bring home with them.At least 100 people in JPMorgan\u2019s home-lending group were told they couldn\u2019t work from home until all of them finish showing they can access systems from a remote location, according to people briefed on the plans. Some workers were asked to use sick leave or vacation days if they were unable to come into the office. One employee who said she wanted to take some time off this week to care for family was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible to bring equipment home yet.\u201cWe have moved very quickly to enable work-from-home capabilities for our mortgage underwriters, and today the majority are,\u201d a JPMorgan spokeswoman said by email. \u201cThe remaining groups will be work from home by the end of the week.\u201dInside Citigroup Inc., most workers in its call centres have continued to report to work, according to the bank. Some employees in Bank of America Corp.\u2019s call centres are allowed to work from home, while others have been told to keep showing up but to maintain some distance from each other, a spokesman said. To be sure, the instructions inside firms have been changing by the day.\u201cThere are managers who will say, \u2018We\u2019re all in this together, if you want to take care of your kids and families, stay home,\u2019\u201d said Paul Sorbera, president of Wall Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting in New York. \u201cAnd then there are others who will say, \u2018We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of.\u2019\u201dThe tension within the industry spans the globe.There are (managers) who will say, 'We have a business to run, and there are clients to take care of'Paul Sorbera \n \nSome London bankers are choosing to work in the office to avoid their imperfect setups elsewhere. One trader for Commerzbank AG said trying to do his job at home was so gruesome that he keeps going into the office even as the contagion spreads. Senior traders at Nomura Holdings Inc. were sent to test the Japanese bank\u2019s recovery site weeks ago, but connectivity issues and the distance from London drove some back to a city they find empty and eerie.Commerzbank is meeting the needs of clients while also protecting employees, according to a bank spokesperson. Nomura declined to comment.Last week, Goldman trading co-head Ashok Varadhan was working from home despite a chaotic week in markets, because he was feeling unwell.Such examples might help Wall Street bosses change decades of habit. In good times, it\u2019s inconceivable for some in the business to step away from trading floors to go see a doctor.At Goldman Sachs, people there said, leaving for a medical appointment sounds so far-fetched that it has become a euphemism for heading out to a job interview.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Cash is king \u2014 despite motherlode of stimulus stocks are still falling today", "description": "The rush into cash and havens has battered risk assets almost everywhere", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-stocks-drop-dollar-rallies-on-stimulus-bets-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/cash-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 19, 2020 11:17 AM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks fell as investors digested a battery of economic and financial measures from global policy makers aimed at easing the market turmoil.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields.

A day after President Donald Trump conceded the U.S. slump alone is set to be \u201ca bad one,\u201d economists threw away their forecasts that the world could avoid tumbling into recession for the first time since the financial crisis.Behind the rethink: The virus\u2019s spread to Europe and the U.S., as well as new evidence that China \u2014 the first to be hit by what is now a pandemic \u2014 experienced a harder hit to its economy than originally projected.Morgan Stanley\u2019s team, led by Chetan Ahya, said a worldwide recession is now its \u201cbase case,\u201d with growth expected to fall to 0.9 per cent this year. At Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius and colleagues predict a weakening of growth to 1.25 per cent. S&P Global added its voice to the chorus with a report expecting that growth would range 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. \nCould shutting stock exchanges stop the markets rot?\n\u2018The magnitude is breathtaking\u2019: China's coronavirus slowdown much worse than feared, boding ill for Canada and global economy\nDavid Rosenberg: Stop looking to 2008, this crisis is more like 9/11\nSuch slumps would not be as painful as the 0.8 per cent contraction of 2009, as measured by the International Monetary Fund, but they would be worse than the downturns of 2001 and the early 1990s. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs anticipate a rebound in the second half, but warn that the risk remains of even greater economic pain. The projections will apply further pressure on policy makers to do more to limit the health emergency and to deliver stimulus that helps companies and consumers through the shock and then drives a rebound in demand afterward.Although the U.S. Federal Reserve and fellow central banks have been active in loosening monetary policy, most governments have been slow in responding and are only now crafting fiscal packages that may still fail to pacify worried investors.\u201cWhile the policy response will provide downside protection, the underlying damage from both COVID-19\u2019s impact and tighter financial conditions will deliver a material shock to the global economy,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s economists said.Writing PrescriptionsThe outlook could darken even further if the virus lasts longer than anticipated, or wields greater economic pain \u2014 given factories, schools, restaurants and shops are closing around the world. A freezing up of markets or a continued sluggishness by governments to act are also regarded as threats.Elsewhere on Wall Street, strategists are laying out what governments should be doing.At JPMorgan Chase & Co., John Normand advocated developed economies repeating their handiwork of the crisis when they delivered fiscal stimulus worth 1 per cent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. George Saravelos, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said governments may also need to step in to guarantee support for households and companiesWhile the Fed gets \u201cfull marks\u201d for its recent response in cutting rates and moving to stabilize credit markets, Northern Trust Corp. Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said Congress and the White House have so far failed to act boldly enough.\u201cThe other side of Washington really needs to step up with something as substantial in size, and intelligent in design,\u201d he said.China is experiencing the biggest pain, and most economists failed to capture how far it would fall, with the likelihood now that its economy will suffer the worst turmoil in many decades. The Morgan Stanley economists now reckon its economy shrank 5 per cent in the second quarter.Since the outbreak originated in China, data is being treated by many as a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in other regions. Morgan Stanley predicts the U.S. and European economies will suffer the most in the second quarter.Predictions for the U.S. still vary wildly, with some guessing activity could even decline as much 10 per cent on an annualized basis in the three months through June. Goldman Sachs is penciling in a 5 per cent dive after zero growth in the first quarter.\u201cThe middle two quarters of this year are going to be very challenging, even if we get the spread of the coronavirus under control quickly,\u201d said Tannenbaum.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Jacqueline Thorpe", "title": "In a sea of red, this Canadian supply-chain stock comes out on top", "description": "Ottawa-based Kinaxis Inc. provides supply-chain-management software \u2014 crucial amid the havoc caused by the pandemic on global shipments", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/in-a-sea-of-red-this-canadian-supply-chain-stock-comes-out-on-top", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/ford.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 17, 2020 10:06 AM EDT", "content": "A company that makes software to track supply chains is the best performing stock in a rout that\u2019s lopped almost 30 per cent off Canada\u2019s S&P/TSX Composite index.Ottawa-based Kinaxis Inc. provides supply-chain-management software \u2014 crucial amid the havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic on global shipments.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used.

That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession.

Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.Global Easing in 2020\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers.

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices.

Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here\u2019s a synopsis of the discussion.Market Structure TestFinancial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that\u2019s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. \u201cHistorically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,\u201d she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. \u201cLiquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dEither way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.\u201cThey are not traditional market makers any longer,\u201d said McCreadie. \u201cI think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.\u201dOil And TroubleThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country\u2019s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.\u201cIf you look at the impact on the oil market, it\u2019s very, very negative for Western Canada,\u201d Vanderhooft said. \u201cAs bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.\u201dSmaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.\u201cThis time around a lot of these smaller players aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.\u201dThe increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks\u2019 thinking more now, said Marks. \u201cYou already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.\u201dVanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a \u201cmore negative position\u201d on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.Carry OnAll three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.\u201c2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn\u2019t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,\u201d McCreadie said, adding there\u2019s unlikely to be \u201csystem failure\u201d now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear marketKevin McCreadie \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,\u201d he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. \u201cI think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.\u201dMarks said BMO hasn\u2019t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. \u201cIn conversations with clients, we haven\u2019t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that \u2018Get me out of the market\u2019 across the board.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe will get through this event,\u201d McCreadie said. \u201cWe always do.\u201dNext Steps\u201cYou talk about fully balanced portfolios, that\u2019s where clients need to be,\u201d said Vanderhooft. \u201cAt times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that\u2019s the case.\u201dMcCreadie\u2019s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth\u2019s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November. While stocks have become cheaper, the lack of visibility makes it \u201chard to have conviction to step in,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Greifeld and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Stocks roar back as governments pledge to step up virus response", "description": "The S&P 500\u2019s gain Friday was its biggest since 2008, even as the gauge lost 11 per cent this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-set-to-tumble-after-wall-street-rout-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-9.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 12, 2020 6:00 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks jumped as President Donald Trump joined other world leaders in seeking to reassure investors that they\u2019ll step up efforts to protect the economy from the coronavirus fallout.The S&P 500 rose more than 9 per cent, providing some respite after stocks\u2019 worst day since 1987, as Trump declared a national emergency to help combat the virus, moved to prop up energy prices and said the private sector will help with efforts to expand testing.

Trudeau also said his government is prepared to use federal financing agencies to further stimulate the economy if needed, a measure that was deployed during the 2008-09 financial crisis.But that may not be enough. Canada\u2019s measures pale in comparison to those set out by countries such as Italy, which plans to spend as much as 25 billion euros ($28.3 billion) on stimulus measures. Perrault recommends the government roll out a fiscal package equivalent to one per cent of GDP, or just over $20 billion, in order to prevent the Canadian economy from going into recession.The Toronto-based bank sees the country\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowing to 0.3 per cent for the year in the absence of significant stimulus. Scotiabank\u2019s isn\u2019t the first bearish call to emerge this week in the aftermath of the oil price collapse but it does represent the most aggressive take yet on Canada\u2019s future.National Bank of Canada Financial and Royal Bank of Canada will release their forecasts later this week. Bank of Montreal was the first of the six banks to revise their forecasts lower this week, with a call for full year GDP growth at 0.5 per cent.The latest stream of downward revisions include predictions that the Bank of Canada will cut rates to 0.25 per cent by June from its current 1.25 per cent. That\u2019s in line with financial market expectations, according to overnight index swaps trading. The last time the Bank of Canada policy rate reached 0.25 per cent was in 2009. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points amid escalating coronavirus concerns, matching an emergency move by the Federal Reserve.Here are the latest revisions from bank economists this week:Scotiabank \u2014 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois PerraultSees Canada\u2019s 2020 GDP at 0.3 per cent in absence of substantial fiscal stimulus and 0.7 per cent if there is fiscal stimulus worth one per cent of GDP.

The two countries\u2019 battle over control of the global oil market comes as the coronavirus pandemic has obliterated energy demand. The sudden collapse in oil prices hit Canadian oil companies hard, prompting oil sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. to slash capital spending by 32% and cancel its crude-by-rail program.After conversations with business leaders in recent days, Kenney said he\u2019s also considering payroll tax relief and using the province\u2019s balance sheet to help companies with their current liquidity crisis.Canada\u2019s oilpatch was already struggling with pipeline shortages that prompted the province to impose production limits on its largest producers at the start of last year.

The Fed, in turn, says it\u2019s waiting for advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which so far has said the virus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact. In the meantime, the Fed has been putting notes repatriated from Asia in quarantine for up to 10 days to ensure it\u2019s safe.The stakes are high for banks and companies handling electronic payments: Billions of dollars in profits hinge on whatever statement or policy authorities ultimately issue.On one side, small and mid-size banks are working to keep branches open so they can keep serving legions of business customers that refill their cash registers daily. Representatives from some lenders think it\u2019s important for regulators to offer guidance on handling money, noting the risk of using currency is low \u2014 comparing it, say, to pushing an elevator button or grasping a handrail.\u2018Hygienic\u2019 PaymentsIf, on the other hand, authorities take steps that discourage the use of dollar bills, it will buttress the credit card industry\u2019s long-running \u201cwar on cash,\u201d sending more transactions through their networks and to payment apps that collect fees.

The shift would be especially dramatic in regions of the world where card use is still relatively uncommon, she said.\u201cDigital payments are already viewed as good for society by governments because they help with financial inclusion, they drive tax revenue and eliminate corruption,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is another reason: \u2018Oh, and it\u2019s hygienic too.\u2019\u201dFighting for PoorAnd on another side are millions of Americans who lack access to bank accounts, as well as poor and rural communities with few if any branches serving residents and local businesses. Many of them rely on cash for commerce. Repeatedly in recent years, consumer advocates have fought stores and restaurants that try to simplify checkout by going \u201ccashless.\u201d Cities such as New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco passed laws requiring dollars be accepted.Some of those groups worry they\u2019re about to face a national battle to allow cashless commerce in response to the coronavirus.\u201cGoing cashless is definitely not something that we particularly support,\u201d said Eric Espinoza, an associate director at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, which helps provide financial services to low-income communities. \u201cWe certainly wouldn\u2019t support it under a hasty decision-making environment in which you\u2019re extremely reactive and potentially not as thoughtful about the repercussions.\u201dDespite the increased popularity of credit and debit cards in recent years, cash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S., accounting for 26 per cent of all payments by consumers last year, according to data compiled by the Fed. Spare change and dollar bills are still overwhelmingly favoured for small purchases, accounting for about 50 per cent of payments under $10.\n\nCash still remains one of the most popular ways to pay for things in the U.S.\n\nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg\n\nRoughly 25 per cent of Americans are either unbanked or underbanked \u2014 with black and Hispanic households making up the largest percentage of those lacking accounts, according to a study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More than half of unbanked households in the U.S. say they lack the funds to keep an account open.\u201cIf you want to go that direction, it\u2019s going to take really thoughtful planning in order to deal with the questions of inclusivity,\u201d John Thompson, chief program officer for the Financial Health Network. \u201cThere\u2019s still really important, substantively sized sectors of the country that are operating outside of the mainstream financial system.\u201dPaper currency in the U.S. is made from 75 per cent cotton and 25 per cent linen, according to the Treasury. That makes the surface of bills coarse and fibrous, allowing germs to adhere more easily and survive longer than they can on smooth objects.

Brent crude was trading 9.4 per cent higher at US$37.54 a barrel at 10:49 a.m. in London. The benchmark plunged 24 per cent on Monday, the biggest drop in almost 30 years.Moscow responded within minutes in what looked like a war of words, with Alexander Novak, the country\u2019s energy minister, saying Russia had the ability to boost production by 500,000 barrels a day. That would put the country\u2019s output potentially at 11.8 million barrels a day \u2014 a record.War StrategyThe outcome of the price war will be determined by Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2019s ability to inflict damage, but also their ability to absorb it.Saudi Arabia has greater offensive abilities, thanks to about 2 million barrels a day of idle production capacity. Riyadh can also use its strategic oil stocks to boost supplies at very short notice, according to people familiar with its strategy.On top of domestic stockpiles, it also stores crude near consumption hubs in Rotterdam, Okinawa and the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir. Russia doesn\u2019t have a network of strategic oil stocks to match.Russia may have the defensive advantage. The Kremlin can dip into its US$150 billion wealth fund to offset the slump and bolster the ruble. Those reserves are sufficient to cover lost revenue \u201cfor six to 10 years\u201d at oil prices of US$25 to $30 a barrel, the Finance Ministry said.Should Brent crude remain at US$35 without an adjustment in Saudi spending, the kingdom would run a deficit of nearly 15 per cent of economic output in 2020, while its net foreign reserves could run out in about five years unless it uses other funding sources, according to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.Free Market\u201cWelcome to the free market,\u201d said Bob McNally, founder of consultant Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. \u201cThe world is about to learn very swiftly how important a swing producer is for stability, not only for the global oil market but the broader economy and geopolitics.\u201dFor decades, the oil market has been largely regulated. First by Americans, who set production quotas for their oil companies through the Texas Railroad Commission in the first half of the 20th century, and later by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel. Through that time, Texas and later OPEC acted as swing producers, upping output at times of scarcity and reducing it at times of lower demand, to keep prices stable.With oil demand rapidly falling due to the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, the Saudi production hike, followed potentially by another one from Russia, is likely to force oil companies to store crude, rather than process it. Traders are already seeking out tankers to store the glut.The International Energy Agency earlier this week said that global oil demand will contract this year for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.The U.S. and other Western countries are starting to worry about the oil price war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful petroleum nations. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Energy denounced in a rare statement \u201cattempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets\u201d.Even as both sides ramped up production and the war of words, Novak said the door wasn\u2019t closed to future talks.

Western Canada Select, the benchmark grade produced by Canada\u2019s oil sands, was down about 19 per cent to US$22.71 a barrel on Monday, in line with the 20 per cent drop for West Texas Intermediate.Canadian producers, particularly those focused in the higher-cost oilsands, have spent years trying to make their operations more efficient. They\u2019ve also curtailed capital spending and worked to repair their balance sheets. Now those efforts will be put to the test. \nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nGlobal stampede out of stocks and oil collapse trample loonie, Canadian energy shares\nOil crash sends a new shock through world already crippled by coronavirus\n\u201cAt these commodity prices, nobody is making money and everybody is going to be free cash flow negative,\u201d said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dThe oil decline hammered Canadian energy stocks. The 30-company S&P/TSX energy index plunged as much as 22 per cent Monday, its biggest intraday decline in Bloomberg data stretching back to 1988. Among the biggest decliners were Cenovus Energy Inc., which dropped as much as 49 per cent, and MEG Energy Corp., which tumbled as much as 47 per cent.To be sure, the long period of retrenchment leaves some Calgary-based producers better prepared for the current crisis than they were for the 2014 crash, which saw U.S. crude prices plummet from above US$100 a barrel in July 2014 to about US$26 less than two years later.For example, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada\u2019s largest integrated oil company, last month reported a cash operating cost of $28.55 per barrel in its oilsands operations last quarter, down 17 per cent from five years ago. The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Below Break EvenCanadian energy companies \u201care better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. \u201cWhile in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels \u2014 WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time \u2014 some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.\u201cThe industry simply doesn\u2019t work at these prices,\u201d Ollenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands.

Monday\u2019s plunge in oil prices is sending them back to the drawing board to consider a much more dire situation. The country\u2019s five largest banks will release updated forecasts in the next few days that will show a significantly weaker growth picture.\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growth,\u201d Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a phone interview. Besides the shock from lower oil prices, the financial market pressures and confidence impacts from coronavirus are \u201cquite a lot to bear\u201d if sustained, Caranci added. \nPeter Tertzakian: This crude war is about a lot more than oil prices and market share\nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nOil price war tests Canadian energy producers' years-long drive to cut costs\nThe oil crisis could be the last straw for the Canadian economy which was already on soft footing at the end of 2019, after a drop in exports and business investment resulted in the slowest quarterly pace of growth in three years. Now the oil shock has created more downside risk.Some economists are even flirting with the idea of a recession.It's very possible that Canada in the first half of the year has no growthBeata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank \n \n\u201cGiven market developments in the last couple of days, the likelihood of a recession has increased dramatically,\u201d Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto, said by phone.As recently as last month, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for growth of 1.6 per cent in 2020 \u2014 in line with what the federal government has been projecting in its fiscal outlook. That forecast was slashed last week to about 1 per cent on the back of the fallout from the coronavirus. The impact of this week\u2019s oil shock is set to drive it even lower.Stocks dropped as much as 10 per cent early Monday in Toronto, the loonie weakened and government bond yields plunged as investor pessimism deepened. Canada exported just over $80 billion (US$59 billion) in crude oil and bitumen in 2018, when benchmark oil prices averaged US$57 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude for April slumped as much as 34 per cent to US$27.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before paring losses to 19 per cent.Trudeau\u2019s TurnThe Bank of Canada lowered interest rates last week in an attempt to stimulate growth. The outcome for the economy in 2020 may hinge on what the federal government does to bolster consumer and business confidence.Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week the government has the tools to shield the economy from the coronavirus crisis, though he stopped short of spelling out specific steps. With the federal budget expected within weeks, Morneau said the government plans to increase the amount it sets aside for emergencies.To be sure, Canada\u2019s oil sector isn\u2019t as large as it used to be, so the impact of lower prices may not be as dramatic. And the industry already underwent a significant adjustment after the rout in crude markets in 2014-15.\u201cYes, it\u2019s a negative, that\u2019s undeniable, but the footprint of the oil and gas sector is not what it was back then,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, a macro-strategist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto.Still, the combination of headwinds could weaken growth to the point where the pain shows up in the labour market. Given Canada\u2019s elevated levels of household debt, that poses broader risks for the country\u2019s financial system.According to the finance department\u2019s own sensitivity analysis, a one-year, 1 percentage point decline in real GDP would have an annual $5-billion (US$3.69-billion) hit on the government\u2019s bottom line. That would be on top of the near $30-billion deficit already forecast this year from the federal government, even before any new spending measures Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during last fall\u2019s election campaign.Markets are already anticipating the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates to levels not seen since the 2008-09 recession. Swaps trading suggests the central bank will lower its policy rate to 0.5 per cent over the next six months, from 1.25 per cent currently.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Metcalf and Venus Feng", "title": "Wealth wipeout from market meltdown reshapes ranks of world's richest people", "description": "Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett are both down US$4.4 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/wealth-wipeout-from-market-meltdown-reshapes-ranks-of-worlds-richest-people?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jeff-bezos.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 9, 2020 2:31 PM EDT", "content": "The wealth destruction caused by Monday\u2019s market collapse is reshaping the ranks of the world\u2019s richest people.Wildcatter Harold Hamm\u2019s fortune plunged 35 per cent to US$3 billion at 11:06 a.m. in New York, a drop that would bump him from the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index if it holds through the close of trading.

For central bankers, the prospect of destabilizing prices are an added complication as they try to model the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy.

The U.S. \u2014 once a winner from low oil \u2014 is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks \u2014 on the way up \u2014 used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.\u201cLower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. \u201cBut now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.\u201dRussian StrategyThe crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there\u2019s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday\u2019s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry \u2014 when prices went as low as US$26 \u2014 contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year\u2019s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown \n \nRussia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it\u2019s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency \u2014 unlike Saudi Arabia \u2014 and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.\u201cRussia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic \u2014 and even political \u2014 self-harm didn\u2019t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Aramco RoutSaudi Aramco \u2014 the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince\u2019s credibility on the line \u2014 saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.\u201cOil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,\u201d said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.\n\nOil tanks at Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMaxim Shemetov/Reuters files\n\nMore immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred \u2014 as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc \u2014 though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it\u2019s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.\u201cSharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors\u2019 energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,\u201d said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIn the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.\u201dThe crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry\u2019s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.Going GreenA slowdown in green plans isn\u2019t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use \u2014 increasing emissions \u2014 and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe \u2014 which is leading the charge on climate change policies \u2014 the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn\u2019t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.\u201cThe Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it\u2019s not clear this will work,\u201d said the LSE\u2019s Hertog, author of \u2018Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia\u2019.\u201cIn the end, this will be Putin\u2019s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Dan Murtaugh and Alfred Cang", "title": "Oil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out", "description": "Goldman Sachs warns prices could drop to near $20", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-drops-31-in-worst-loss-since-gulf-war-as-price-fight-erupts", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/oil.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2020 6:44 PM EDT", "content": "Oil markets tumbled more than 30 per cent after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price-war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that is likely to have sweeping political and economic consequences.Brent futures suffered the second-largest drop on record in the opening seconds of trading in Asia, behind only the plunge during the Gulf War in 1991. As the global oil benchmark plummeted to as low as US$31.02 a barrel, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned prices could drop to near US$20 a barrel.The cataclysmic plunge will resonate through the energy industry, from giants like Exxon Mobil Corp. to smaller shale drillers in West Texas. It will hit the budgets of oil-dependent nations from Angola to Kazakhstan and could also reshape global politics, eroding the influence of countries like Saudi Arabia. The fight against climate change may suffer a setback as fossil fuels become more competitive versus renewable energy.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, the market was overwhelmed by a wave of selling at the open,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Houston-based energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC. \u201cOPEC+ has clearly surprised the market by engaging in a price war to gain market share.\u201dHammered by a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus, the oil market is sinking deeper into chaos on the prospect of a supply free-for-all. Saudi Arabia slashed its official prices by the most in at least 20 years over the weekend and signalled to buyers it would ramp up output \u2014 an unambiguous declaration of intent to flood the market with crude. Russia said its companies were free to pump as much as they could.Aramco\u2019s unprecedented pricing move came just hours after the talks between Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies ended in dramatic failure. The breakup of the alliance effectively ends the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.The state-owned Saudi producer has privately told some market participants it plans to raise output well above 10 million barrels a day next month and could even reach a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.Oil prices have suffered massive drops each time that Saudi Arabia has launched a price war to drive competitors out of the market. West Texas Intermediate fell 66 per cent from late 1985 to March 1986 when the country pumped at will amid a resurgence of U.S. oil output. Brent crude briefly dropped below US$10 a barrel when the kingdom had a showdown with Venezuela in the late 1990s.With oil demand already plummeting due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, traders forecast that prices will drop even further. \u201cThe oil market is now faced with two highly uncertain bearish shocks with the clear outcome of a sharp price sell-off,\u201d said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York.Brent for May settlement tumbled as much as US$14.25 a barrel to US$31.02 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, the biggest intra-day loss since the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq in January 1991. It pared some of those losses to trade 22 per cent lower at US$35.39 a barrel as of 8:04 a.m. in Singapore.West Texas Intermediate crude plunged 22 per cent to US$32.22 a barrel after sliding as much as 27 per cent to US$30 a barrel just after the open. Trading was frozen for the first few minutes because of the scale of the loss.While the price crash was dramatic, for oil specialists the movements in time-spreads, options and volatility are just as remarkable. Brent\u2019s three-month price structure widened sharply as oil for prompt delivery collapsed against later shipments. It moved deeper into contango, a sign of bearishness and oversupply, making it profitable for physical traders to buy crude and put it in storage, either in onshore tank farms or at sea on tankers.The plunge in oil also ricocheted across financial markets. U.S. equity futures plunged, along with oil currencies including the Norwegian krone and Mexican peso, while havens such as the Japanese yen and gold jumped. Shares of oil producers got hammered, with Australia\u2019s Santos Ltd. and Oil Search Ltd. losing more than 20 per cent in early Sydney trading.The prospect of another price war is spooking traders who will remember the crash that began in 2014, when an explosion in U.S. shale production prompted OPEC to open the spigots in an attempt to suppress prices and curtail shale output.That strategy ended in failure, with shale producers proving too resilient and Brent crude tumbling below $30 a barrel in 2016 amid a global glut. It was that crash that prompted OPEC to club together with Russia and others to curtail output and help shore up their oil-dependent economies.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Anthony DiPaola and Javier Blas", "title": "#ICYMI Oil prices are tanking because Saudi Arabia has launched an all-out price war", "description": "Pact between Saudis and Russians that has underpinned oil prices since 2016 has collapsed", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/aramco-slashes-crude-pricing-starting-oil-war-as-opec-flops", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/aramco.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 8, 2020 3:16 AM EDT", "content": "Saudi Arabia kicked off an all-out oil war on Saturday, slashing official pricing for its crude and making the deepest cuts in at least 20 years on its main grades, in a bid to push as many barrels into the market as possible.The cuts in monthly pricing by state producer Saudi Aramco are the first indication of how the Saudis will respond to the breakup of the alliance between OPEC and partners like Russia. The kingdom plans to accompany the price cuts with a hike in crude supply, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Saudi Arabia is now really going into a full price warIman Nasseri at oil consultant FGE \n \nAramco\u2019s pricing announcement is the first major marketing decision since producer talks in Vienna ended in dramatic failure on Friday, when Saudi Arabia was unable to persuade Russia to agree to prolonged and deeper cuts in output. Saudi production is set to exceed 10 million barrels a day next month, according to the people, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations. Such an increase would amount to more than 3 per cent of Saudi output in February.\u201cSaudi Arabia is now really going into a full price war,\u201d said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at oil consultant FGE.The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016. Unshackled from the cartel\u2019s restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output. A reduction in the official selling prices, or OSPs, suggests the Saudis are looking to do just that. \nOil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out\nStocks fall most since financial crisis, oil plunges most since Gulf War. Here\u2019s a look at the damage\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a high-risk, high-stakes approach,\u201d Tim Fox, chief economist at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC, said Sunday in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cIt will be a question of who blinks first.\u201dAramco\u2019s pricing decision affects about 14 million barrels a day of oil exports, as other producers in the Persian Gulf region follow its lead in setting prices for their own shipments. Every month, the Gulf\u2019s biggest producers announce the official selling price for their crude grades as a differential \u2014 a premium or discount \u2014 against regional benchmarks. The changes are usually measured in cents and, at most, a couple of dollars.The state producer lowered April pricing for crude sales to Asia by US$4 to US$6 a barrel and to the U.S. by US$7 a barrel, it said in a pricing announcement emailed Saturday just before midnight Saudi time. Aramco didn\u2019t immediately comment on the strategy behind such deep reductions in pricing.With the coronavirus eroding demand, pushing Brent crude down about 20 per cent so far this year heading into the meeting on Friday, the Saudis had hoped to shore up prices. Brent fell further after Russia balked at OPEC\u2019s plan, closing the week down more than 30 per cent for the year.Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by US$6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company\u2019s pricing sheet.Aramco sells most of its crude in Asia, a region that \u2014 until the virus outbreak in China \u2014 had served as the driver for global growth in energy demand.The company lowered pricing to northwest Europe and to the Mediterranean region by between $6 and $8 a barrel. Aramco made its biggest cut for crude to northwest Europe, where an $8 a barrel reduction in most grades amounts to a direct challenge to Russia, which sells a large chunk of its flagship Urals crude in the same region. Aramco will sell Arab Light at an unprecedented $10.25 a barrel discount to Brent in Europe.The world\u2019s biggest oil exporter had expected to announce its pricing on Thursday but delayed the decision until after the meeting on Friday between the OPEC and allies including Russia. The postponement marked the first time in at least a decade that Aramco missed its pricing schedule. It typically announces pricing for its crude on the fifth day of each month.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada beats forecasts with gain of 30,300 jobs in show of resilience", "description": "Unemployment rate rises to 5.6 per cent", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-gains-surprise-30300-jobs-in-february-jobless-rate-climbs-to-5-6", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jobs.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 6, 2020 9:05 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s job market strengthened for a third-straight month, a sign of strength within the domestic economy even as the spread of coronavirus threatens future growth.Canadian employment grew by 30,300 in February, beating economist expectations for 11,000 new jobs, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa.

While the data is generally healthy, the gains of recent months aren\u2019t likely to last if coronavirus concerns continue to seep into broader consumer and business confidence The report showed a moderate gain in employment but still reflects a deceleration in job growth from the monster employment gains seen in the first half of 2020 Get MoreBritish Columbia and Ontario posted the biggest job losses; they also saw the unemployment rate rise notably as more people searched for work, the report stated Quebec posted notable job gains of 20,000 continuing a trend of solid growth in employment in the province for several months, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent, the lowest since at least 1976.

Uncertainty will remain high as long as the outbreak duration is unknown, she said.\u201cIt is, unfortunately, spreading undetected more than initially was thought,\u201d Georgieva said. \u201cThe moment it became clear it is no more just about China and maybe a small number of countries in Asia surrounding China, then the outlook on what the impact could be changed.\u201d \nCanadian companies ramp up coronavirus precautions with travel restrictions, work-at-home options\nBank of Canada cuts rate by half point, stands ready to cut more in face of coronavirus threat\nThe case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy\nGeorgieva said that the IMF is making available US$50 billion to help countries deal with the virus, including $10 billion at zero interest for the poorest nations. Countries can draw on that money if they need it, she said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.The shift comes as governments and central banks step up emergency actions to protect against greater economic damage and financial-market instability, with the Bank of Canada on Wednesday joining the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates by a half point. Global infections have topped 93,000, resulting in more than 3,200 deaths since the virus originated in Wuhan, China.Georgieva said the virus demands a global response as it affects significant elements of both supply and demand, and IMF member nations are committed to coordinated action. She said that the IMF is confident that global growth this year will be slower than 2019, when growth was 2.9 per cent. The IMF had previously seen 2020 growth accelerating to 3.3 per cent.Malpass, who on Tuesday announced a US$12 billion immediate support package to help poorer countries confront the health and economic impacts from the spread of coronavirus, said 12 countries have so far expressed interest in participating. The speed and breadth of the response will be crucial to its success, he said at the briefing.On Monday, the Washington-based organizations pledged in a joint statement to use \u201cavailable instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance\u201d to aid member countries as they respond to the virus.Georgieva also said Wednesday that the IMF has conducted a dry run for the virtual format that will be used to convene their spring meetings next month with the World Bank instead of holding the conference in Washington.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ewa Krukowska", "title": "Europe embarks on economic revolution with landmark climate law to make region climate neutral by 2050", "description": "Europe wants to make it illegal by 2050 to emit more greenhouse gases than can be removed from the atmosphere", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/europe-embarks-on-economic-revolution-with-landmark-climate-law", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/greta-thunberg.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 10:37 AM EST", "content": "Europe wants to make it illegal by 2050 to emit more greenhouse gases than can be removed from the atmosphere.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a draft law on Wednesday that would commit the region to become the first climate-neutral continent by the middle of the century. The legal proposal is the cornerstone of the bloc\u2019s Green Deal, a far-reaching strategy that foresees a radical overhaul of the European economy over the next three decades.\u201cThe Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future,\u201d von der Leyen said in a statement. \u201cIt offers predictability and transparency for European industry and investors. And it gives direction to our green growth strategy and guarantees that the transition will be gradual and fair.\u201d \nThe $900 billion write-off of \u2018stranded energy assets\u2019 needed to make climate targets will be one of the biggest capital shifts ever\nWhat Jeff Bezos\u2019s $10 billion can do for the fight against climate change\nCanada\u2019s big banks are going green \u2014 but they\u2019re lending more and more money to the oil industry\nThe draft measure proposes a binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, without setting intermediate targets at this stage. That triggered criticism of the law by environmental activists, including Greta Thunberg, who called the law \u201csurrender\u201d because it doesn\u2019t ensure more rapid action.The scolding highlights the challenges policy makers face as they seek to balance business interests with the ambitions of an ever-growing green movement. Fighting climate change has catapulted to the top of the EU\u2019s agenda, with 93 per cent of Europeans seeing global warming as a serious problem.The Green Deal was designed to appease these concerns and become a new growth strategy for the 27-nation bloc. But regulatory proposals by the EU\u2019s executive arm are subject to approval by member states, and the climate law reflects the need to seek a compromise between competing national positions. With differing energy mixes, wealth and industrial strength, EU governments are set to wrangle over every bit of the climate strategy and the draft law that will set the basis for the clean-up.However, the dynamics may change with the draft measure. It will pave the way for a new regulatory track where measures to cut emissions avoid a veto by a single country, a tool that was used several times by coal-dependent Poland to halt ambitious policies.Once approved by national governments and the European Parliament, the climate law will start a regulatory frenzy. Everything from energy production to agriculture and the design of cities will be overhauled under the Green Deal strategy that von der Leyen has described as a moonshot.\u201cI\u2019m excited by this,\u201d said Peter Vis, senior adviser at Rud Pedersen Public Affairs in Brussels. \u201cVon der Leyen is setting the ambition without knowing how we will get there. But when Kennedy committed to putting a man on the moon he also wouldn\u2019t know if that is possible.\u201dHere are the main elements of the draft law:EU-wide emissions and removals of greenhouse gases must be balanced by 2050 at the latest Member states must take necessary steps to enable collective achievement of the goal by the EU Commission will review the current 2030 emission-reduction goal by September, exploring options for a new goal of 50%-55% By June 2021, commission will assess how to amend various rules on emissions, including a law on the bloc\u2019s carbon market By September 2023, the commission will every five years assess the progress made by member states following global stock-takes under the Paris Agreement to protect the climate Commission may propose new climate targets every five years following the assessments; trajectory to get to climate neutrality will start with the goal for 2030 The EU executive is also seeking more powers to make sure the bloc delivers on the net-zero emissions goal, making it more difficult for governments and the EU Parliament to object to intermediate targets. It wants to regulate those goals via measures known as delegated acts. To oppose them, a qualified majority of votes is needed in the Council of the EU, which represents member states, and a majority in the Parliament.\u201cEnshrining the climate neutrality goal into law is a crucial and welcome step,\u201d said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch lobby in Brussels. \u201cHowever, the climate law\u2019s success will be determined by how it translates into short-term climate action. Europe faces an existential climate crisis and every year matters to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.\u201dThe biggest challenge for Europe will be to secure investment for the environmental clean-up. The costs are dizzying: to reach the existing 2030 goal Europe needs investment of 260 billion euros (US$290 billion) annually.Earlier this year, the commission proposed a 1 trillion-euro plan designed to be the financing pillar of the Green Deal. It envisions earmarking around 500 billion euros from the EU budget for the clean shift over the next decade, while separately leveraging 280 billion euros of private and public investment and establishing a funding mechanism with another 143 billion euros, also from public and private sources, to help regions facing the most costly clean-ups.To ensure the Green Deal materializes to be Europe\u2019s new growth strategy, new markets must be developed, with both public and private finance flowing to small and large companies alike to help them deploy first new technologies, according to director general of the chemical industry association Cefic.\u201cThe proposal for a climate law is an important first step to achieve investor confidence, which is crucial,\u201d Mensink said. \u201cIt is a start of an important journey; our sector must go through a deep transformation, within only one or two investment cycles, for which we need enabling conditions. Therefore, much more is needed.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Paula Sambo and Esteban Duarte", "title": "A hedge fund pioneer bets on higher rates, recovery in stocks after temporary coronavirus setback", "description": "David Picton expects a V-shaped recovery later in the year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/a-hedge-fund-pioneer-bets-on-higher-rates-recovery-in-stocks?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stocks.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 9:59 AM EST", "content": "A top hedge fund manager in Canada says the coronavirus sell-off is a temporary setback that will soon give way to an economic rebound, sending stocks and interest rates higher.\u201cWhile there will certainly be an economic hit from the virus, when you go back through these \u2018pandemic\u2019 periods of time, there\u2019s really, without exception, a fairly significant recovery that takes place in markets and economies,\u201d David Picton, founder of hedge fund Picton Mahoney Asset Management, said during an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s office in Toronto.The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency half-percentage point rate cut Tuesday, a dramatic signal that policy makers are growing more worried about the economic threat from the virus.

One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.Missing SignalsFor Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

The opposite is happening this year, with mortgage rates declining as bond yields drop amid the coronavirus and the Bank of Canada expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca96361995');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca96361995');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca96361995'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nFebruary sales were up by about 15 per cent compared to January.\u201cSales growth will be strong this year,\u201d board President Michael Collins said in a statement.

Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d \nU.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rate: Read the official statement\nFalling victim to market fear may do more damage to your portfolio than the coronavirus itself\nJustin Trudeau opens door to possible aid for Canadian companies hit by virus\nPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.G7 CoordinationThe Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2020U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.Clarida StanceAs recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.No Silver BulletOne lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Virus-driven interest rate cut could add kerosene to Canada's already hot housing market", "description": "Market poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/virus-driven-rate-cut-could-add-kerosene-to-canadas-housing-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 10:30 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s housing market is poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus.While a reduced travel from China may crimp sales in Vancouver, and the potential for a recession could set the market back, the possibility of interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada is likely to fuel further declines in mortgage rates and draw buyers into the market.\u201cPeople are not concerned about coronavirus, people are not concerned about recession,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said Monday by phone. \u201cThe only things they\u2019re worried about is buying a home \u2014 and if they don\u2019t buy now they might spend more in the future.\u201d \nRBC widens mortgage lead just as Canada\u2019s housing market shows signs of a revival\n\u2018Rock stars\u2019 of construction in high demand in Toronto, North America\u2019s fastest growing city\nLuxury home prices jump in some parts of Canada as boomers, young executives compete with foreign buyers\nA confluence of factors is priming the pump for a brisk buying season.

The Paris-based OECD now expects the weakest global growth this year since the 2009 recession, and said a \u2018long lasting\u2019 epidemic would risk a worldwide recession.The prospect of central banks\u2019 action helped halt the worst rout in stocks since that crisis. Money markets now see the Fed lowering its main rate by 50 basis points this month, and give a 70 per cent chance the European Central Bank will pare its by 10 basis points. \nOECD warns coronavirus could halve global growth\nCoronavirus will likely shave off 0.5% of Canadian GDP; 50bps BoC rate cut 'not impossible', analysts say\nCoronavirus to knock U.S. earnings growth to zero, Goldman says\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the Fed will ultimately slash by 100 basis points in the first half of the year. The BOE will cut by 50 basis points and the ECB by 10 basis points, it said.There is even speculation that the Fed will move before its policy makers gather on March 17-18, and some economists see the potential for international policy makers to coordinate cuts for the first time since 2008. Investors increasingly bet the central banks of Australia, Canada and Malaysia will ease at meetings already scheduled for this week.\u201cGlobal central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a report on Sunday. \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201dWith interest rates already low, governments may also need to do more to support demand. The French government said on Monday that Group of Seven finance ministers will hold a conference call this week to coordinate their response. Italy is already seeking to widen its budget deficit to pay for at least 3.6 billion euros (US$4 billion) in proposed emergency economic measures.Just a week ago, key central bankers were saying it was too soon to respond to the outbreak, a reticence to act that may also reflect their reluctance to be seen as racing to rescue investors. The plunge in global stocks is forcing a change in stance.\u201cCentral banks will almost certainly all induce one form of easing or another, \u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.Japan to IndonesiaThe Bank of Japan backed up Monday\u2019s promise to help markets by offering to buy 500 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) of government bonds to provide liquidity. Indonesia\u2019s central bank lowered the amount lenders need to keep on reserve to shore up liquidity in its markets.By not alluding to monetary policy as Powell did, Japan\u2019s statement revealed the constraints the BOJ and many other central banks are under. Japan\u2019s key rate is already minus 0.1 per cent compared to the Fed\u2019s 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent range.The ECB is also limited by a deposit rate that stands at minus 0.5 per cent. Prior to the outbreak, policy makers were signalling a reluctance to reduce it even further given concern that banks, who are already seeing profit margins squeezed by negative rates, might pull back on lending.President Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB didn\u2019t yet think the outbreak will have a lasting impact on inflation, its primary mandate.An ECB spokesman declined to comment on whether a statement would be issued on Monday, and referred back to Lagarde\u2019s comments of last week.\u201cWe are vigilant, we are mobilized, but we remain calm and proportional in the responses we need,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on BFM Business television on Monday.Less Effective?Even before the latest crisis, economists were questioning the benefits of ultra-loose monetary policies given more than 700 interest-rate cuts and several rounds of bond-buying since the financial crisis. They boosted asset prices, but failed to generate substantial rebounds in economic growth.Lower rates won't help manufacturers whose factories are closed \n \nFor central bankers, whose prior stimulus moves have already greatly depleted their ammunition, the new challenge is that easier policy may be even less effective to combat the economic pain posed by a health emergency. That\u2019s because by shutting workplaces in China and increasingly abroad, the virus is dealing a blow to the world\u2019s capacity to produce goods. Lower rates won\u2019t help manufacturers whose factories are closed or which lack materials to make their own products. On the demand-side, they would likely also fail to spur consumers to shop or travel if they\u2019re worried about infection. But easier monetary policies should counter tighter financial conditions, support markets and maintain the supply of credit, thus helping to drive a rebound in demand once the virus is under control. Weak inflation also gives most central banks scope to act.Fresh evidence of the economic shock triggered by the virus came Monday as IHS Markit reported its Chinese factory index dropped to the lowest since the series began in 2004. Gauges for Japan and South Korea also slumped.\u201cRate cuts are not the silver bullet, although they can support markets somewhat,\u201d said Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich.Governments will likely have to help too. Economists at Morgan Stanley predict the combined fiscal deficit of the four largest advanced economies plus China will now run to at least 4.7 per cent of global gross domestic product this year, the biggest since 2011.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Richard Clough and Rachel Layne", "title": "Jack Welch, \u2018manager of the century\u2019 who reshaped GE, dies at 84", "description": "Led the industrial conglomerate for two decades", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/jack-welch-former-ge-veteran-dies-cnbc", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jack-welch.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 2, 2020 9:33 AM EST", "content": "Jack Welch, the champion of corporate efficiency who built General Electric Co. into one of the world\u2019s largest companies and influenced generations of business leaders, has died. He was 84.His death was reported Monday by CNBC, which cited his wife, Suzy.The former GE chairman and chief executive officer, whose blunt style and ceaseless cost cutting earned him the sobriquet \u201cNeutron Jack,\u201d mentored proteges who went on to run some of the world\u2019s best-known companies. Named \u201cManager of the Century\u201d by Fortune magazine in 1999, he presided over a stock surge of almost 3,000 per cent during a two-decade tenure.\u201cHe became the gold standard of greatness, the icon of industrial imagination,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale University business professor who knew Welch since the 1980s. \u201cHis track record over those 20 years as CEO is hard to see excelled anywhere.\u201dKnown simply as Jack to even low-level employees, Welch became the youngest CEO in GE\u2019s history in 1981. He created a leaner company, yet one whose dependence on finance would eventually prove to be a threat. Along the way, he molded GE\u2019s culture to reflect his demanding personality, one larger than his 5-foot-7-inch (1.7-meter) frame.\u201cI like challenging people. I like debate. I like all those things,\u201d he told interviewer Charlie Rose less than two months after his 2001 retirement. \u201cAnd yet I love having a drink with \u2019em, too.\u201dSecond CareerWelch stepped down four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He remained active for more than a decade as a consultant and media commentator.Business leaders extolled his ability to boost profit and shareholder wealth with his restless, results-driven approach. GE became the world\u2019s biggest company by market value at more than $500 billion in 1999.Imitators across corporate America copied his leadership strategies, and recruiters snapped up lieutenants including W. James McNerney Jr., who later became Boeing Co.\u2019s CEO, and Robert Nardelli, who ran Home Depot Inc. and Chrysler. Another GE executive, Jeffrey Immelt, would best them to succeed Welch.Welch\u2019s legacy was dented in retirement, as GE\u2019s stock lost a third of its value within a year. The shares would lag behind the pre-Sept. 11 level for virtually all of Immelt\u2019s 16 years as CEO.Soon after Enron Corp. collapsed in late 2001, GE found itself facing accounting questions about whether Welch relied on moves such as one-time asset sales to produce consistently steady profit gains. GE Capital under Welch grew so vast that unit\u2019s struggles in the 2008-2009 financial crisis would imperil all of GE. The company has since exited nearly all of the lending businesses.Finance Revisited\u201cThere\u2019s been some revisiting of the robustness of the financial services model. GE Capital was providing cover for some other parts of the business,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. There was a \u201cbacklash that did dog Jack Welch.\u201dJohn Francis Welch Jr. was born Nov. 19, 1935, in Peabody, Massachusetts. He was the only child of John Sr., a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor, and Grace Andrews Welch.Growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, he was outspoken and athletic. He played golf, hockey and baseball at Salem High School, where he was voted \u201cmost talkative and noisiest\u201d boy by classmates and wrote in the school literary magazine that he wanted to \u201cmake a million.\u201d Welch\u2019s mother infused him with self-confidence and helped him overcome a boyhood stutter \u2014 \u201cthe most influential person in my life,\u201d he wrote in his 2001 autobiography \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201d\u2018You Punk!\u2019After a close hockey defeat as a youngster, Welch flung his stick across the ice, prompting his mother to march into the locker room, grab him by the jersey and shout: \u201cYou punk! If you don\u2019t know how to lose, you\u2019ll never know how to win.\u201dIn 1957, he graduated with honours from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst with a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. Three years later, he received a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois and took a $10,500-a-year job with GE in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the company developed new businesses in plastics.Working his way through the ranks from vice president to vice chairman, Welch gained a reputation as a maverick, questioning whether GE was being run the right way. He saw GE\u2019s future in plastics, medical equipment and financial services, not household appliances.Winners, LosersAt 45, Welch succeeded Reginald Jones as chairman and CEO. While GE was profitable, Welch was concerned that it was too big to be flexible. He sorted GE\u2019s divisions into \u201cwinners\u201d \u2014 those first or second in their industries \u2014 and \u201closers,\u201d mostly older units that had to improve or face disposal.Over a five-year span in the 1980s, he sold more than 200 businesses and closed dozens of factories. Annual dismissals of the 10 percent of employees deemed the lowest performers also became standard. Welch\u2019s moves would shrink the workforce by one-third to 239,000 people.\u201cA successful leader can shock an organization and lead its recovery. An unsuccessful leader will shock an organization and paralyze it,\u201d Welch said in a 1994 Industry Week interview. \u201cOrganizations constantly need to be regenerated.\u201dGE under Welch spent more than $25 billion on acquisitions, and he pushed into finance as the U.S. economy shifted away from manufacturing. He looked overseas, too, boosting foreign sales by more than 50 per cent.He pioneered widely imitated training programs, including \u201cWork-Out,\u201d in which employees learned to accelerate decision-making with days of brainstorming. In 1995, Welch implemented the Six Sigma quality controls to improve manufacturing processes. Noting GE\u2019s success, companies around the world would adopt a similar methodology.\u2018Tremendous Passion\u2019Welch knew thousands of employees by name and would send handwritten notes to voice his approval or dissatisfaction.\u201cHe had tremendous, tremendous passion for the business, but he also had tremendous passion for people,\u201d William Conaty, whose 40-year GE career included serving as human resources chief under Welch, said in a 2014 interview. \u201cIf your wife was sick, he\u2019d want to know how she was doing.\u201dWelch also worked six days a week, taking only Sunday off to golf \u2014 he called working weekends \u201ca blast\u201d \u2014 and expected similar dedication from those who wanted to get ahead. \u201cI never once asked anyone, \u2018Is there someplace you would rather be \u2014 or need to be \u2014 for your family or favourite hobby or whatever?\u201d\u2019 he said in his 2005 book, \u201cWinning.\u201dWelch delayed his mandatory age-65 retirement for almost a year for a final challenge: a US$53 billion bid for Honeywell International Inc. that collapsed when he balked at European regulators\u2019 demands for concessions.Baseball, GolfA lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, Welch would test executives and potential hires on their baseball knowledge. He was also a golf addict, hitting the links with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and executives including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.After leaving GE, Welch served as a part-time adviser, a partner at investment firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice and consultant to companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s business school, opened a management institute bearing his name and stayed in the public eye with guest-host gigs on CNBC and New England Sports Network.Welch married Carolyn Osburn in 1959, and they had four children before divorcing in 1987. He was married to corporate lawyer Jane Beasley for 13 years. They divorced in 2002 amid revelations of an affair with Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer that began when Wetlaufer was interviewing him for an article.The two married in 2004 and went on to collaborate on \u201cWinning,\u201d but not before divorce proceedings opened a public argument over Welch\u2019s fortune, with his second wife\u2019s lawyers claiming his asset valuation of US$456 million was at least $100 million too low.

While it probably doesn\u2019t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it\u2019s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week \u2014 and that\u2019s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox\u2019s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It\u2019s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox\u2019s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it\u2019s a pretty dry business. \nCoronavirus crash wipes $6 trillion off world stocks; TSX drops most in 5 years\nMarket panics like this one can be fertile ground for \u2018bottom-up\u2019 investors\nChance of Canadian supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus high: RBC\nBut the Centers for\u00a0Disease Control and Prevention is warning that\u00a0the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China\u2019s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now\u00a0threaten\u00a0the U.S. If that\u2019s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. \u201cSo far we\u2019re not seeing an uptick,\u201d Clorox CEO Benno Dorer\u00a0said during the company\u2019s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees\u00a0Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox\u2019s stock is already quite expensive, and it\u2019s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their \u201csell\u201d ratings on the stock after Clorox\u2019s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company\u2019s other product lines \u2014 bags and charcoal \u2014continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn\u2019t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it\u2019s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division \u201cgrilling\u201d to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn\u2019t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox\u2019s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it\u2019s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt\u2019s Bees lip care.)With this week\u2019s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak.\u00a0Clorox may play\u00a0its own\u00a0crucial role in combating the disease,\u00a0but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "TSX ready for opening bell after early close yesterday over technical issue", "description": "Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stock-bourse-says-ready-for-friday-open-after-early-close", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 28, 2020 7:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s main stock exchanges said all systems are ready for the start of business on Friday after halting trading for hours due to a technical issue.The Toronto Stock Exchange said interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX Group Ltd.\u2019s trading engine.

The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group\u2019s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.\u201cI don\u2019t know the inside of what happened at the TSX.

Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. \u201cVolume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,\u201d Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues \u201cbut it\u2019s not impossible to trade,\u201d she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. \u201cRest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,\u201d he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission.

Toronto is dotted with more cranes than any other North American city, and Tiburcio has bragging rights for operating the tallest one.It gives him a killer view of Lake Ontario from a perch 860 feet (262 metres) up, even higher than the condo towers and office buildings nearby. But he\u2019s not getting paid to enjoy the scenery. He\u2019s doing one of the most critical tasks in construction. \nToronto builders try a new tactic to lure millennials to the hated suburbs.

Every day is something new and every day is a new challenge.\u201dCrane operators have been called the \u201crock stars\u201d of construction, willing to work for hours in isolation at dizzying heights, manipulating machinery to hoist steel beams and other heavy materials around congested building sites. Demand for the operators is soaring in and around Toronto, where about 120 cranes rise from projects across the metropolitan area.Every day is something new and every day is a new challengeMathew Tiburcio, crane operator \n \nIt\u2019s part of a decade-long building boom in North America\u2019s fastest-growing city that shows no signs of wavering. A surge of immigration has fuelled the market for housing, and a proliferation of condo towers. New office developments downtown, already home to Canada\u2019s biggest financial firms, are drawing tech companies including Google, Shopify Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which is moving its Canadian headquarters from a Toronto suburb to CIBC Square.This winter workday is typical for Tiburcio. He rises in the wee hours for the 50-kilometre (31-mile) drive from his suburban home to reach the job site by 5 a.m. He\u2019s one of about 740 workers building the twin-skyscraper project being developed by Canada\u2019s Ivanhoe Cambridge and Houston-based Hines.\n\nCranes operate over the CIBC Square construction site in Toronto.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nTiburcio spends 20 minutes ascending to the operational heart of a Comedil CTL 630 tower crane. He starts by riding a lift up the side of an unfinished building to an open 46th floor. He then crosses a metal walkway to the crane\u2019s white steel tower, and scales a series of ladders to reach the cab.After doing his inspections, he gets busy. He\u2019ll spend the next eight hours or so in a cramped enclosure, on a padded seat he personalized with a black cover and a yellow, orange and red flame design.His hands embrace a pair of joysticks: One lifts the boom and swings the crane left and right, while the other controls the hoist. Paperback-sized video screens guide his efforts. To his upper left is a monochrome screen showing the crane\u2019s radius, load weight and hook height. Motorola radios dangle overhead, providing a link to workers below.\u201cYou\u2019ve got many trades that need the crane and you\u2019re doing your best to help everybody out and give everybody a lift,\u201d said Tiburcio, a crane operator for 11 years. \u201cEverybody needs to work, everybody has their job to do.\u201dAt 49 floors, this is the tallest building Tiburcio has worked on, and he calls it the highlight of his career.\n\nToronto has more cranes than any other city in North America.\n\nGalit Rodan/Bloomberg\n\nBut the job hasn\u2019t been easy. When he started on the project a couple of years ago, he worked 70 to 80 hours a week while he and his wife faced the demands of being first-time parents. Things eased up when relief operators were brought in, giving Tiburcio the chance to spend more time with his son, who\u2019s now a toddler and thinks Dad has the coolest job.\u201cHe already knows all about tower cranes,\u201d Tiburcio said.The Toronto native knows about fatherly influence: He followed his own dad into construction, spending three years as a labourer. When he was ready for a change, Tiburcio\u2019s boss at the time told him about the demand for tower crane operators. He\u2019s had steady work since making the transition, and makes a six-figure salary.As he mans his controls, Tiburcio takes time to scan his 360-degree view and tally the cranes around him.

Their cumulative return in 2019 was 273 per cent.It\u2019s early in the year to be tallying gains and losses, but it\u2019s the abrupt reversal of sentiment that\u2019s startling. Investors won\u2019t know the exact cost of the coronavirus, both in human and economic terms, for months. But they know the illness is now spreading fast outside China, and that the headwinds will hit an aging global business cycle and a U.S. equity bull market that has outlasted all others. \nWorld shares slump for fifth day, bets grow on rate cuts to counter damage\nStocks plunge, bonds surge after CDC warns Americans to prepare for coronavirus outbreak\nBlows keep coming for our economy, and the Bank of Canada will be left to clean up the mess\n\u201cGiven where we are in markets, given where we are in the cycle in 10 years, anything that\u2019s negative in markets they\u2019re going to jump,\u201d said Philip Webster, director of European equities at BMO Global Asset Management in London. \u201cInvestors shoot first and ask questions later at the moment.\u201dThe scorecard reflects those kinds of concerns.

The preference for these dollar-denominated assets has also given wings to the greenback.These are the big survivors of the everything rally. For much of 2019, U.S. bonds and gold rallied on the back of a central bank pivot toward easier policy at the start of the year. Now, expectations that more rate cuts or stimulus will be needed to combat the impact of the coronavirus are further stoking those kinds of bets.\u201cBond yields have stayed low, stimulus is there, rates are still being held down,\u201d said Webster. \u201cYes, there\u2019s been a shift out of equities into non-risk assets, but I\u2019m fairly relaxed\u201d about where the portfolio is, he said.Overlaying the Gregorian calendar on asset moves can be deceptive, of course. Any investor or trader whose performance isn\u2019t measured annually may look at the picture very differently. For example, even with the turmoil of the past four trading sessions in U.S. stocks, an investor who bought the S&P 500 Index 12 months ago would still be up 12 per cent through Monday.On Wednesday morning stocks in particular appeared to be making fresh efforts to stabilize. Futures for the benchmark U.S. gauges fluctuated, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index clawed back well over half of its earlier losses. Market players are scrambling to figure out whether the virus will be contained and a V-shaped recovery will ensue, or if the impact will be lengthy leading to more L-shaped economic performance.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit early to know which will be the scenario,\u201d said Denis Panel, head of the multi-asset, quantitative and solutions group at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where we could increase the risk \u2014 the V \u2014 or we could reduce the risk and short the market potentially if it\u2019s an L scenario.

The central bank is now actively developing a prototype digital currency, according to a background document.\u201cWe need to move forward to work out what a potential CBDC might look like and how it could be managed, if the decision were ever taken to issue one.\u201d Lane said regarding preparations for a potential central bank digital currency in Canada.Central banks around the world are trying to get to grips with emerging payment technologies. Private-sector initiatives such as Facebook Inc.\u2019s Libra are adding urgency to the debate over how digital currencies should be handled.The Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have called for central banks to at least study the possibility of as private sector firms experiment with competing units of exchange.The Bank sees two main scenarios where the central bank could see the need to issue its own digital currency: firstly, if the use of cash is restricted or eliminated, and second, if private cryptocurrencies were to make serious inroads.\u201cIn both scenarios, there would be an argument for the Bank of Canada to step in,\u201d said Lane. \u201cThe Bank would do this as a trusted public institution, creating an official digital currency that is designed with the interest of the public as its top priority, with no commercial motive.\u201dIt isn\u2019t the Bank of Canada\u2019s first foray into the matter \u2014 staff have authored several papers on the potential effects of introducing a central bank digital currency, including the possibility of reduced market power of private banks.

Refining the sticky, black bitumen scooped from some mines in so-called upgraders is also very carbon-intensive. Newer, smaller projects, while more efficient, still use a lot of energy to extract the oil with the help of steam.While attempts to make Canada\u2019s oilsands into an economically viable source of crude have been ongoing for about a century, the industry experienced its heyday in the 2000s and 2010s, when fears abounded that the world may be running out of crude.Those fears prompted a flood of global investment as nations and international producers rushed to secure supplies. From 2004 to 2014, about $210.1 billion was invested in the oilsands, according to data from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Over those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day, and Canada shot up from the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest.\n\nA heavy hauler drives past smaller trucks near the entrance of Suncor Energy\u2019s North Steepbank Mine, located north of Fort McMurray, Alta.,\n\nVincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network files\n\nThe industry has struggled since global oil prices crashed from more than US$100 a barrel in mid-2014. New pipeline projects were stalled by environmentalist opposition and legal challenges, weighing on Canadian heavy crude prices. International giants including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips sold off oilsands assets. And capital spending in the oil sands fell for five straight years.The situation came to a head in late 2018, when a wave of new production, the shortage of pipeline space and a heavier-than-normal refinery maintenance season in the U.S. combined to cause a crash in Canadian heavy crude prices. That prompted Alberta\u2019s government to implement mandatory production limits that started in 2019 and may remain in effect for the rest of this year.Teck Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay, in a letter explaining the company\u2019s decision on Frontier, acknowledged the project raised broader questions over climate change and how countries\u2019 regulatory regimes should balance resource development and emissions reductions.\u201cThe growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cIn that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.\u201dBut the hard economic reality remains the potentially biggest hurdle. Frontier\u2019s 2011 application relied on long-term oil prices over its four-decade life of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven\u2019t seen since 2014. With both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude prices in the US$50-a-barrel range and the U.S.\u2019s Permian Basin continuing to pump more oil, those prices may not return anytime soon.The growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolvedDon Lindsay, Teck Resources CEO \n \n\u201cThis was the last big oilsands mining project advancing in the oilsands,\u201d said Kevin Birn, IHS Markit\u2019s director of North American crude oil markets. \u201cFully new greenfield ones outside this one, I don\u2019t think there is any.\u201dAnalysts had generally positive reactions to Teck cancelling Frontier. Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba said that despite the $1.13-billion writedown Teck would take on the project, \u201cit removes overhanging concerns about the company potentially making a significant investment in fossil fuel amid raising ESG focus.\u201dTo be sure, the oilsands industry is far from shutting down. Major producers are generally profitable and producing free cash flow. Capital spending is even projected to tick up this year. Producers are continually developing new technologies and finding ways to cut costs.They can still expand existing mines and are able to add output from what are known as in situ projects, which resemble more familiar methods of oil extraction by tapping underground resources through the use of wells. Those tend to be smaller, cheaper and faster to build.But even those projects are having trouble in the current environment. Imperial Oil Ltd. last year delayed its $2.6 billion Aspen oilsands project, which had been approved and was scheduled to start production in 2022, because of Alberta\u2019s production limits.And with the cancellation of Frontier, there are no major mine projects of the kind that formed the industry\u2019s bedrock. The last big mine to come online was Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s $17-billion Fort Hills mine, which started producing in 2018.Teck is a partner at Fort Hills and is considering getting out of that investment, too.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Chris Fournier and Doug Alexander", "title": "Easier mortgage rules won't fix Canada\u2019s housing crisis", "description": "Economists at two of Canada's largest banks say the solution lies in housing supply", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/easier-mortgage-rules-are-no-fix-for-canadas-housing-crisis", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/housing-market.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 25, 2020 9:37 AM EST", "content": "Mortgage rule changes introduced by the finance department last week aren\u2019t sufficient to address the affordability crisis faced by many Canadians, according to two of the nation\u2019s largest banks.The finance department unveiled a new benchmark interest rate on Tuesday as part of stress tests that determine whether people qualify for insured mortgages.

In a letter explaining why the miner pulled the plug, Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay placed the blame on governments, saying Canada doesn\u2019t yet have a clear framework to reconcile resource development and climate change.\u201cThe growing debate around this issue has placed Frontier and our company squarely at the nexus of much broader issues that need to be resolved,\u201d Lindsay said. \u201cIn that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.\u201dBeyond the climate-change debate, the economics of the project have changed radically since it was first proposed in 2011. Back then, crude prices often topped US$100 a barrel and fears abounded that the world was running out of oil. Canada\u2019s oilsands, which contain the world\u2019s third-largest reserves, saw a boom of spending as companies and countries rushed to secure supplies.Jobs vs ClimateBut since then, fracking techniques unlocked massive reserves in Texas\u2019s Permian Basin, helping the U.S. surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s top oil producer. Teck\u2019s application for the project relied on long-term prices of about US$95 a barrel, a level global benchmarks haven\u2019t reached since 2014. West Texas Intermediate traded below $52 a barrel on Monday.The mine would have produced about 260,000 barrels of crude a day, more than the daily oil consumption of Norway. It also would have emitted the equivalent of about 4.1 million tons of carbon-dioxide a year, making it harder for Canada to meet its greenhouse-gas reduction targets.But for Alberta, which has struggled with the downturn in oil prices since 2014, Frontier would have been a boon, creating a projected 7,000 jobs during construction and as many as 2,500 operating positions during its four-decade life. It also would have contributed about $70 billion to federal, provincial and municipal governments through taxes and royalties.Teck said in its earnings statement Friday that it would need to take an impairment charge if Trudeau rejected the mine.

Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer, has sought to redeploy those funds into higher-returning deals or stock purchases, but has been stymied by what he\u2019s said are \u201csky-high\u201d prices for good businesses.Buffett spent a portion of his annual letter reassuring shareholders about the future of the company once it\u2019s no longer run by the billionaire investor and his business partner, Charlie Munger, who turned 96 this year.\u201cBerkshire shareholders need not worry: Your company is 100 per cent prepared for our departure,\u201d Buffett said.Your company is 100 per cent prepared for our departure \n \nAt Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, shareholders will be able to submit questions to be answered by lieutenants Ajit Jain or Greg Abel, Berkshire vice chairmen who are considered top contenders to someday replace Buffett. They answered a few investors questions at last year\u2019s meeting.Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings fell to $4.42 billion in the fourth quarter, down 23 per cent from a year earlier, driven by underwriting losses at its namesake reinsurance group, which was hurt by typhoons in Japan, wildfires in California and Australia, and widening losses at its business writing retroactive reinsurance contracts.Berkshire\u2019s Class A shares last year underperformed the S&P 500 Index by the widest margin since 2009. The stock has gained just 1.1 per cent this year.Also in Berkshire\u2019s 2019 annual report, released alongside Buffett\u2019s letter Saturday:Kraft Heinz Co., which counts Berkshire as its largest shareholder, had a tumultuous 2019, with writedowns, management shakeups and downgrades to junk. Buffett\u2019s company carries its Kraft Heinz investment on its balance sheet at $13.8 billion, a figure unchanged since 2018\u2019s fourth quarter, even as the market price of the stake dropped to $10.5 billion at the end of last year.Berkshire\u2019s BNSF railroad posted a 3.8 per cent gain in profit in the fourth quarter, just shy of record earnings in the previous three months, as a decline in expenses helped counter falling revenue across shipments of products such as coal, consumer items and agricultural goods.

At his own Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which underperformed the stock market last year by the widest margin in a decade, an increase in repurchases might not be cause for celebration.Buffett has found little success deploying Berkshire\u2019s growing pile of cash. Its last big takeover, a US$37.2 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp., was more than three years ago. This year, the conglomerate was outbid for a tech company. Berkshire\u2019s struggle to find well-priced takeovers led it to open another path for putting money to work: The company loosened its buyback policy almost two years ago, but has repurchased only US$4.1 billion of its shares since then.\u201cWe\u2019re gradually getting more pessimistic about using our money,\u201d Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we bought anything.\u201d \nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire dips into ETF market with two bets for a pension plan\nThe gospel according to Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger: lower your expectations\nWarren Buffett finally has dinner with Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur who paid $4.57-million for the opportunity\nBuybacks haven\u2019t made much of a dent in Berkshire\u2019s record US$128-billion mountain of money either, weighing on its stock price because, as Buffett himself says, the funds earn \u201conly a pittance.\u201d Berkshire investors will be scouring Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, set for release Saturday, for clues about his strategy after a year of missed deals and shares that rose at a slower pace than the S&P 500 Index \u2014 their worst underperformance since 2009.We're gradually getting more pessimistic about using our moneyCharlie Munger \n \n\u201cThey just aren\u2019t buying back a lot of stock, they aren\u2019t putting a lot of money to work in public securities, they\u2019re not buying portfolio companies outright,\u201d Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview. \u201cThe cash balance continues to grow.\u201dNo ElephantsWhile 2019 wasn\u2019t the year for an \u201celephant-sized acquisition,\u201d Buffett was hunting. Berkshire reportedly passed on Tiffany & Co. but did make an offer for Tech Data Corp., ultimately losing out to private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc.The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also spent the last few months of the year plowing money into stocks new to its portfolio, taking stakes in Kroger Co. and Biogen Inc. Even that did little to chip away at Berkshire\u2019s cash hoard, and it was still a net seller of stocks in the fourth quarter.Buffett\u2019s letter will be released alongside Berkshire\u2019s annual report, which will include quarterly results for his sprawling company. Operating earnings probably rose in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, according to Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Berkshire\u2019s net-income figure now factors in swings in the US$220-billion stock portfolio, volatility that Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore.As for acquisitions, Buffett for years has stressed patience, with prices for good businesses becoming \u201csky-high.\u201d Last year, the S&P 500 Index notched its biggest gain since 2013. Waiting for markets to turn might be the wisest course for Buffett, according to Shields.\u2018Do Nothing\u2019\u201cThe right thing to do is to do nothing if the potential acquisitions are overpriced,\u201d Shields said in an interview.As to whether the challenging environment for acquisitions could mean more Berkshire share buybacks in the future, Munger provided no guidance in last week\u2019s interview, following the annual meeting of his Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles.\u201cWho can tell?\u201d he said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says\u201cFireworks on the corporate front in conjunction with Berkshire\u2019s announcement of 4Q earnings are unlikely, in our view. Berkshire didn\u2019t make any major acquisitions in the past three months, and share repurchases were probably modest in the quarter.\u201d\u2013Matthew Palazola, senior analystWhile the Oracle of Omaha may address the frustrations of dealmaking and investing in 2019, Buffett often uses the letter as a platform to delve into a wider range of issues too, including the economy, politics and investment fees.Here are some other topics that might come up in the letter:Kraft HeinzOver the past year, a massive writedown, management changes and a regulatory probe at the packaged-food giant caused turmoil for Berkshire, its biggest shareholder. More recently, Kraft Heinz was downgraded to junk by some credit-rating companies, which has weighed on its stock.Following a delay related to the problems at Kraft Heinz, Berkshire\u2019s portion of its earnings are once again included in the conglomerate\u2019s results. Buffett\u2019s company carried its Kraft Heinz stake at a value of US$13.8 billion on its balance sheet at the end of September, almost US$4.7 billion more than the market price at the time. The conglomerate said it\u2019ll continue to monitor the investment for impairment, but didn\u2019t think it was required then.\u201cI have thought they have needed to write down the value of the asset for several quarters now,\u201d Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview. \u201cI am surprised and dismayed that the carrying value has not been reconciled to reality.\u201dGeicoBuffett\u2019s company famously keeps a relatively tight corporate staff, with just 26 employees in the office, so any reshuffling of duties tends to attract investor attention. Late last year, Berkshire named Todd Combs, who helps Buffett oversee investments, to run auto insurer Geico, in addition to his role managing at least US$14 billion in stocks. While Buffett\u2019s deputy worked at Progressive Corp. years ago, most of his career has been spent managing investments.\u201cThat was a really surprising appointment,\u201d said Shanahan of Edward Jones. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t have that kind of experience \u2014 not only running a large organization, but running an insurance company.\u201dCombs knows a lot about auto insurance so the appointment made sense, according to Munger. The auto insurer will increasingly need to figure out how to navigate changing technology, such as artificial intelligence for underwriting, Munger said.Geico has also been facing pressure from rivals including Progressive, which sparked a question from a shareholder at last year\u2019s annual meeting about how Geico stacked up to its competitor. Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations at Berkshire, said Geico has \u201csignificant\u201d advantages in terms of controlling expenses, but that Progressive is better at managing losses.\u201cGeico is very aware of this disadvantage on the loss ratio that they are suffering, and they\u2019re very focused on trying to bridge that gap as quickly as they can,\u201d Jain said at the time.Geico ended up tweaking its strategy last year, building out capabilities long championed by Progressive and Allstate Corp. Geico introduced a telematics offering, which connects cars and phone apps to track drivers\u2019 habits.SuccessionBuffett\u2019s letter always spurs questions about succession for the 89-year-old CEO and his 96-year-old business partner Munger. In 2018, Berkshire appointed two key lieutenants, Jain and Greg Abel, to its board, promotions that Buffett said at the time were movements toward succession.Buffett hasn\u2019t publicly named his successor, a fact that ramps up speculation around any public announcements. Many investors have been focusing on Abel, whose mandate includes overseeing all of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses. Those responsibilities put him in charge of companies from the sprawling energy empire he led for years to retailers Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candies and apparel brands Fruit of the Loom and Brooks Sports.PoliticsBuffett has been carefully navigating the increasingly bifurcated U.S. political climate in recent years. While he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he has yet to endorse a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential race, though he has expressed support for Michael Bloomberg, who\u2019s seeking the Democratic nomination. (Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Buffett\u2019s 2019 letter contained a carefully worded section on how U.S. prosperity has been achieved in a bipartisan manner. He might take a similar approach this year.\u201cHe may say something thinly veiled within the context of the American system and preserving the American system of capitalism,\u201d CFRA\u2019s Seifert said. \u201cHe runs a very large, globally interconnected company. It\u2019s probably not a bad idea for him to be measured in what he says.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello and Paula Sambo", "title": "Pension giant Caisse to sell one-third of its malls in Canada amid e-commerce hit", "description": "Besides a sale, the Caisse's real-estate unit, Ivanhoe Cambridge, will consider transforming malls with everything from residential housing to logistics space", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/caisse-de-depot-to-sell-one-third-of-malls-amid-e-commerce-hit", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/caisse-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 20, 2020 2:01 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s second-biggest pension manager is preparing to sell a third of the shopping centres it owns in its home market as e-commerce finally starts to bite the country\u2019s brick-and-mortar retailers.Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, says it will look for an array of solutions for its 25 Canadian malls after their problems contributed to a 2.7 per cent decline in the value of its real estate portfolio in 2019.

It was affected by the weak performance of Canadian shopping centers, whose valuations are declining as a result of a consumer shift toward e-commerce, and by residential real estate in New York, in light of new regulations to control rent increases.The Caisse manages the pension plan of retirees in Quebec, Canada\u2019s second most populous province, as well as various provincial insurance plans.Its 2019 results trailed the average 14 per cent increase of Canadian defined pension plans, as estimated by RBC Investor Services. The Caisse results were 1.6 per cent below the fund manager\u2019s own benchmark, mostly due to the performance in the real estate and infrastructure portfolios.Still, the pension fund said it has generated $11 billion in value added compared to its benchmark portfolio over five years and more than $18 billion over ten years. The Caisse said its weighted average annual return was 8.1 per cent and 9.2 per cent for five and 10 years, respectively.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sridhar Natarajan", "title": "Morgan Stanley buys E*Trade in biggest acquisition on Wall Street since the financial crisis", "description": "Deal follows Charles Schwab buying TD Ameritrade to create discount brokerage giant", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/morgan-stanley-dives-deeper-into-retail-with-etrade-deal", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/morgan-stanley.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 20, 2020 10:33 AM EST", "content": "Morgan Stanley agreed to buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp. for US$13 billion, pushing further into the retail market in the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street firm since the financial crisis.The all-stock takeover adds E*Trade\u2019s US$360 billion of client assets to Morgan Stanley\u2019s US$2.7 trillion, the companies said Thursday in a statement. Morgan Stanley also gets E*Trade\u2019s direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities to complement its full-service, advisory-focused brokerage.\u201cOur clients increasingly want digital access and digital banking, and their clients want wealth-management advice,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the continuing evolution of Morgan Stanley into a stable, well-diversified business.\u201dIn reshaping the firm since the financial crisis, Gorman has been emphasizing Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth-management powerhouse. Purchasing E*Trade helps him add clients who are less wealthy than its traditional customers. The New York-based company has lost some business to the retail brokerages in recent years as those firms invested heavily in their web platforms.\u201cWall Street banks continue to covet Main Street customers,\u201d Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate.com, said in an email. The acquisition \u201cgives them access to brokerage customers, employees with company stock, and the lifeblood of financial services \u2014 low-cost retail bank deposits.\u201dThe retail-brokerage industry is being reshaped by price wars and consolidation. In early October, Charles Schwab Corp. eliminated commissions for U.S. stock trading, spurring other brokerages to follow suit and sweeping away an important revenue stream.The following month, Schwab agreed to buy rival TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for about US$26 billion and create a mega-firm with US$5 trillion in assets, forcing smaller brokerages like E*Trade to contend with a much more formidable competitor.\u2018Hefty Price\u2019Stockholders in E*Trade, which posted worse-than-expected earnings last month, will receive 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each of their shares, valued at US$58.74 based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty hefty price,\u201d said Alison Williams, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The deal is consistent with Morgan Stanley\u2019s strategy to dive deeper into the mass-affluent market, she said.Shares of Morgan Stanley slumped 4.1 per cent to US$54.01 at 9:34 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline in six months. E*Trade surged the most in almost 11 years, gaining 24 per cent to US$55.90. Gorman said he expects Morgan Stanley shares to rebound once investors start valuing the stock at a higher multiple over the long term.For Morgan Stanley, the deal \u201cdeepens the \u2018safe\u2019 wealth-management franchise \u2014 rich in fees and stability,\u201d credit analyst David Havens at Imperial Capital wrote in a note to clients. \u201cIt reduces reliance on the more mercurial trading and markets businesses.\u201dE*Trade, founded in 1982, was one of the early players in the discount-brokerage industry. Its reach with self-guided traders online gives Morgan Stanley access to a broader customer base, including those who may have less to invest than its current clients.Morgan Stanley will keep the E*Trade brand in some way, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think you\u2019d be completely nuts to get rid of,\u201d he said, comparing the brand\u2019s worth to how valuable Merrill Lynch is to Bank of America Corp. and the Chase name is for JPMorgan Chase & Co.Long seen as a potential takeover target for the likes of TD Ameritrade, E*Trade was left looking for ways to reinvent its image and lure more customers in the wake of its rival\u2019s merger with Schwab. In a signal that it was on the hunt for acquirers, a January filing boosted compensation for executives in the event of a change in control.JPMorgan served as the lead financial adviser to E*Trade, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was external legal counsel.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ken Parks", "title": "'Reality check' for Canadian cannabis as capital crunch makes lower-cost growing nations more attractive", "description": "'Everyone is waking up to the fact that it doesn't make sense to grow cannabis in the tundra of Canada'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/cannabis-capital-crunch-may-boost-uruguay-appeal-investor-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/uruguay.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 20, 2020 10:08 AM EST", "content": "The North American cannabis industry has a capital crunch \u2014 and this might channel investment to low-cost growing nations like Uruguay, according to veteran pot entrepreneur Jordan Lewis.\u201cEveryone is waking up to the fact that it doesn\u2019t make sense to grow cannabis in the tundra of Canada\u201d and other places in North America, said Lewis, chief executive officer of Silverpeak Life Sciences Uruguay Inc.

Lewis sees Australia and the EU as his main export markets in 2020, with Israel emerging as another possible buyer.\u201cWe expect to be shipping over 100 kilos a month in the near term. Right now the limiting factor for us is our actual production,\u201d he said.Production LimitFotmer has asked the Uruguayan government to expand its annual production limit to 150 metric tons (330,693 pounds) of dried flowers from 10 tons today.While the international market for THC rich dried flowers is still strong, Lewis said he wants to sell some value-added products such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, creams or tinctures as soon as next year.Fotmer recently shipped dried flowers to California-based Biopharmaceutical Research Company for analysis and profiling that will help the firm demonstrate it can consistently produce certain cannabinoids for medical and non-medical products, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Julie Johnsson", "title": "Rags, tools and other debris found in fuel tanks of undelivered 737 Max jets in yet another embarrassment for Boeing", "description": "Boeing has struggled with similar quality lapses in other aircraft", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/airlines/boeing-finds-tools-rags-and-other-debris-in-fuel-tanks-of-undelivered-737-max-jets", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/boeing.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 19, 2020 10:46 AM EST", "content": "Boeing Co. is inspecting more than 400 stored 737 Max jets after discovering debris such as tools or rags left in the fuel tanks of several newly built but undelivered aircraft.The checks aren\u2019t likely to create a new delay for the Max, which Boeing estimates will be cleared to fly by midyear, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named as the matter is confidential.

The relatively small investments, which totalled US$25 million across both funds, are Berkshire\u2019s only publicly disclosed ETF holdings in its most recent quarterly 13F filing. The investments are in a pension plan, according to Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek.Buffett, whose Berkshire holds a record US$128 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury bills, has been questioned before about why he didn\u2019t put the firm\u2019s unused cash into an index fund. The 89-year-old investor said last year at his annual shareholder meeting that he thinks Berkshire should have some cash available to quickly deploy if the chance to strike a big acquisition arises, even though he\u2019d rather own an index fund than U.S. Treasury bills.

Large institutions will often park money in ETFs to keep exposure to the market while minimizing cash drag in their portfolios, he said \u2014 which is likely what Berkshire has started to do with its record cash pile.\u201cThey use it almost as a temporary parking spot, and I think the liquidity is what they\u2019re attracted to,\u201d Balchunas said.In that scenario, ETFs are essentially being used as an alternative for derivatives contracts, Balchunas said. He estimates that this manner of institutional usage accounts for roughly 5 per cent to 10 per cent of ETF assets.Climbing Cash PileBerkshire has accumulated a more than US$71-billion stake in Apple Inc. in recent years and purchased stock in Kroger Co. and Biogen Inc. during the last three months of 2019.Still, Berkshire\u2019s failed to find a massive acquisition of a company to keep growing the conglomerate in recent years. That\u2019s weighed on Berkshire stock with the Class A shares increasing nearly 11 per cent last year, short of the almost 29 per cent gain in the S&P 500 during the same period.In the meantime, Berkshire is likely using these ETFs as a liquidity way-station of sorts, according to Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research\u2019s New York-based director of ETF research.\u201cSPY and VOO provide institutional investors the ability to stay in the market, while keeping their options open as they seek out individual stocks,\u201d Rosenbluth said.Bloomberg.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-5be4017736edb575f4c07ab5728cebad-5ebca9dc6f4cc');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-5be4017736edb575f4c07ab5728cebad-5ebca9dc6f4cc');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-5be4017736edb575f4c07ab5728cebad-5ebca9dc6f4cc'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Max Abelson", "title": "'It was always invevitable': Junk-bond king Michael Milken wins redemption with Trump pardon", "description": "A club of well-connected executives, powerful investors and multibillionaires lobbied the White House to take mercy on Milken", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/junk-bond-king-michael-milken-wins-redemption-with-trump-pardon", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/michael-milken.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 19, 2020 9:48 AM EST", "content": "David Bahnsen, who manages more than US$2 billion, was enjoying a lunch of Dover sole at Michael\u2019s in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday when he got the news.A text from a friend in Donald Trump\u2019s administration told him the president was pardoning Michael Milken almost exactly 30 years after the junk-bond king pleaded guilty to securities fraud.Bahnsen shared the news with his lunch date, high-fived him, explained what was happening to the Wall Street figure at the next table, and slapped his palm, too.\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody in finance who doesn\u2019t believe that this is the right thing to do,\u201d the executive, who runs wealth management firm Bahnsen Group, said in a phone call. \u201cIt was always inevitable.\u201d \nDiverse boards tied to fewer financial \u2018irregularities,\u2019 Canadian study finds\nFormer WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers, convicted of orchestrating one of America\u2019s largest accounting frauds, dies at 78\nJohn Felderhof, geologist who played central role in Bre-X gold mining scandal, dead at 79\nBahnsen is a member of a club of well-connected executives, powerful investors and multibillionaires who wanted the White House to take mercy on Milken.Supporters include casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, Apollo Global Management Inc. co-founder Josh Harris, Vornado Realty Trust boss Steven Roth and Carlyle Group Inc.\u2019s David Rubenstein, according to a White House announcement that also cited Bahnsen.

Those bonds let a ragtag group of corporate raiders borrow enough to take over some of America\u2019s best-known companies, and Milken inspired Wall Street acolytes who stayed loyal well past Drexel\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 and his tearful apology in court for securities fraud.White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the conviction was based on \u201ctruly novel\u201d charges.Milken embraced the spotlight after prison, recasting himself as a philanthropist trying to cure cancer and help children.

The firm agreed to pay US$20 million to settle SEC charges that it failed to disclose a US$50-million loan by a client to one of its senior executives.

Sales were down in 11 of 21 industries, representing 43 per cent of the Canadian manufacturing sector.In volume terms, sales were down 0.4 per cent.For all of 2019, sales increased 0.5 per cent, down from 5.4 per cent in 2018 and 6 per cent in 2017.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "William Mathis", "title": "GE and rivals gain ground on a global wind-turbine giant", "description": "Wind power is likely to generate over a quarter of the world's electricity by 2050", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ge-and-rivals-gain-ground-on-a-global-wind-turbine-giant", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/wind.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 18, 2020 8:30 AM EST", "content": "Vestas Wind Systems A/S lost market share last year in the wind turbine industry it has dominated for more than a decade.While the Danish manufacturer remains the biggest producer of the machines that generate electricity from the wind, General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA of Spain gained share in the market for machines that work on land.The findings in a report from BloombergNEF underscore the competitive pressures that are squeezing the industry, reducing margins even as the pace of installations accelerates in many nations. Last year\u2019s drop in Vestas\u2019s market share was the first BNEF recorded since it began keeping the data in its current form in 2014. \nWhat Jeff Bezos's $10 billion can do for the fight against climate change\nCanada's big banks are going green \u2014 but they\u2019re lending more and more money to the oil industry\nAfter a decade out in the cold, 2020 could be the year of the pipeline\nWind power is likely to generate over a quarter of the world\u2019s electricity by 2050, according to a BNEF forecast. The majority of that will come from onshore wind farms. In 2019, developers installed almost 61 gigawatts of wind turbines worldwide, up 22 per cent from the year prior. This year that number is forecast to jump an additional 24 per cent to 75 gigawatts, analysts at BNEF say.The market for onshore wind power was mostly concentrated in China and the U.S. last year. GE installed about half of all the onshore turbines in the U.S., adding 40 per cent more turbines there than in it did in 2018. A few companies in China \u2014 Ming Yang Smart Energy Group Ltd., Zhejiang Windey Co., Ltd. and Dongfang Electric Corporation Ltd. \u2014 expanded market share there.\u201c2020 is set to be another strong year for installations in China and the U.S., as developers rush to build before subsidies lapse,\u201d said Oliver Metcalfe, wind analyst at BNEF. \u201cBut uncertainty post-2020 could expose some bigger players unless they diversify to new growth markets.\u201dAs for as offshore wind, Siemens Gamesa kept its top spot as Orsted A/S built out its 1.2 gigawatt Hornsea facility in the British section of the North Sea. Vestas pools its offshore wind assets in the MHI Vestas Offshore Wind A/S venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan.The offshore wind market will probably continue to grow faster than its onshore counterpart because the large size and scale of machines sited at sea.Last year, GE received its first orders for the biggest turbine on the market, the Haliade-X, which it will deliver in the U.S. and U.K. in the coming years. That\u2019s a sign that competition will only intensify now that the number of major offshore turbine suppliers has grown to three.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Matthew A.

You won\u2019t find her at the Barron\u2019s Roundtable, which \u201cgathers some of Wall Street\u2019s best minds.\u201d She was included in the Bloomberg 50: The People Who Defined Global Business in 2018.Her focus on innovation, \u201ccentered around genome sequencing, robotics, artificial intelligence, energy storage and blockchain technology,\u201d enabled Ark Innovation ETF to increase 127 times, to US$2.4\u00a0billion from its US$15 million grubstake in 2017. In the process, the Ark ETF rewarded its shareholders with more than three times the return of the S&P 500 Index and more than twice the Nasdaq\u2019s bounty. Since its inception, Ark has earned almost 2.4\u00a0times more than the S&P 500 and 1.7\u00a0times the Nasdaq, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.We're all about finding the next big thing \n \nAt a point when money management mostly is a passive, index-driven business, Wood is a discerning stock picker with about US$11 billion of assets. Her selection of health-care juggernauts Juno Therapeutics Inc., based in Seattle, and Invitae Corp., in San Francisco, returned 286 per cent and 173 per cent, respectively, in the past three years. Choosing Palo Alto-based Tesla and Buenos Aires-based MercadoLibre Inc. among consumer discretionary companies netted 185 per cent and 269 per cent in her fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u201cWe\u2019re all about finding the next big thing,\u201d said Wood during an initial interview with David Westin on Bloomberg Wall Street Week earlier this month. \u201cAnyone hewing to the benchmarks, which are backwards looking, they\u2019re not about the future. They are about what has worked. We\u2019re all about what is going to work.\u201dSince she graduated summa cum laude in finance and economics from the University of Southern California in 1981, Wood has been assistant economist at the Capital Group; chief economist, analyst, portfolio manager and director at Jennison Associates; co-founder of the hedge fund Tupelo Capital Management, and chief investment officer of global thematic strategies at AllianceBernstein, where she managed more than US$5 billion. Her favorite innovator is Copernicus, the Renaissance man who located the sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe.Soon after launching Ark in 2014, Wood made Tesla her fifth-largest holding. In 2018, she increased it to No. 1, or 10 per cent of the fund, as most analysts soured on the maker of zero-emission, battery-electric vehicles.In 2016, when Tesla plummeted 11 per cent, and 75 per cent of the analyst recommendations opposed any purchases, Wood almost tripled her Tesla position to 5,072 shares. The following year, after Tesla appreciated 46 per cent, and 68 per cent of the analysts remained bearish, she enlarged her stake more than 13 times to 67,653 shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When Tesla rallied 26 per cent last year amid tepid recommendations from 70 per cent of the analysts, she almost doubled her stake to 471,594 shares.Tesla continued climbing this year \u2014 91 per cent, the best performer in the Nasdaq 100 index and No. 1 among the 500 most highly capitalized U.S. companies. Wood was a consistent seller during the rally \u2014 reducing her holding to 292,000 shares \u2014 solely to keep her Tesla stake at the designated maximum 10 per cent of her fund.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t sold, Tesla would probably be well north of 20 per cent in the portfolio,\u201d she said during a phone\u00a0interview last week. \u201cLast year, we were buying aggressively when analysts were saying Tesla was going to run out of cash and go bankrupt.\u201d Tesla still is \u201cincredibly undervalued,\u201d she said.That\u2019s an opinion considered absurd by most analysts, who insist nothing justifies Tesla\u2019s valuation at almost US$150\u00a0billion, or 58 per cent more than the market capitalization of global sales leader Volkswagen AG.On the contrary, says Wood, Tesla\u2019s share of EV sales increased a percentage point to 18 per cent when the so-called Tesla killers \u2014 from BYD Co. Ltd and BAIC Motor Corp. in China to Nissan Motor Co. in Japan and Volkswagen, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG in Germany and General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in the U.S \u2014 started selling their own battery-electric vehicles. Wood believes the legacy automakers will lose money on their EVs, while Tesla becomes increasingly profitable and remains years ahead of its rivals in battery and chip technology.The company also has 14 billion miles of real-world driving data. Its closest competitor, Waymo, has data on 20 million miles.The investors who have been Tesla naysayers have gotten far more attention than Wood. News articles about Tesla short sellers, including David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital LLC and Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates Ltd., are far more numerous on the Bloomberg system. More than 100 stories showcased Einhorn\u2019s disdain for Tesla, and more than 40 similarly featured Chanos, while there were around 20 for Wood during the same period.Investors were similarly dubious about Amazon.com, which appreciated 1,029 per cent during its first five years after the initial public offering in 1997 and 228 per cent during its second five-year period. Tesla has gained 1,018 per cent during the five years after its 2010 IPO and appreciated 206 per cent since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s the same idea that analysts hated Amazon during that entire period \u2013 not on the bubble but after the tech and telecom bust,\u201d Wood\u00a0said.In her latest assessment last month, she\u00a0wrote: \u201cBased on our updated expectations for electric vehicle (EV) cost declines and demand, as well as our estimates for the potential profitability of robotaxis, our 2024 expected value per share for TSLA is US$7,000.\u201dThat\u2019s a far cry from the US$340 in August 2018, when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted: \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at US$420. Funding secured.\u201dMusk subsequently received a letter from Wood urging him not to take the company private because she saw Tesla rallying to US$4,000 in five years. Before the month ended, he said his plan to take Tesla private wasn\u2019t \u201cthe better path.\u201d Even Musk seemed impressed by Wood\u2019s judgment. \u201cThe letter was to him and the board, and he did say that he and the board took the letter into consideration and it did influence them,\u201d she said.Tesla said last week that\u00a0it will sell about US$2 billion of new shares and that Musk would purchase as much as US$10 million of the offering.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you we were the reason,\u201d Wood\u00a0said. \u201cWe were a little peapod back them, and we\u2019re still a little peapod in the scheme of the asset management world.\u201d But, she said, \u201cI think our research is the best in the world on Tesla.\u201dSo far at least, she\u2019s been right on the money.With assistance from Shin PeiBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Akshat Rathi", "title": "What Jeff Bezos's $10 billion can do for the fight against climate change", "description": "Plan to donate to scientists, activists and NGOs changes the game in climate philanthropy", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/what-bezoss-10-billion-can-do-for-the-climate-fight", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/jeff-bezos-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 18, 2020 8:11 AM EST", "content": "Jeff Bezos on Monday announced he is committing US$10 billion of his own wealth to save the planet. His 130-word post on Instagram was light on detail, but there\u2019s still a lot we can tell based on what we do know.This isn\u2019t Bezos\u2019s first big climate announcement, of course. In September, the world\u2019s richest man committed Amazon to a \u201cclimate pledge\u201d to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. That announcement came after\u00a0months of protests from employees wanting the company to do more on climate change, especially in comparison to tech peers like Microsoft and Google.         View this post on Instagram           Today, I\u2019m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.\u2063\u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063\u2063 Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs \u2014 any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth.  It\u2019s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. \u2063\u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063\u2063 I\u2019m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common \u2014 let\u2019s protect it, together.\u2063\u2063\u2063 \u2063\u2063\u2063 \u2013 Jeff A post shared by  Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) on Feb 17, 2020 at 10:00am PSTThe Bezos Earth Fund will be different from the Bill Gates-led US$1-billion Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund, which seeks to make investments that will generate returns. Instead, Bezos wants to make donations to scientists, activists and NGOs. That changes the game in climate philanthropy. \nElon Musk calls Bill Gates \u2018underwhelming\u2019 after billionaire buys electric Porsche over a Tesla\nJeff Bezos just spent $165-million on a Beverly Hills mansion \u2014 a record for Los Angeles\nBehind Amazon\u2019s HQ2 fiasco: How Jeff Bezos\u2019s envy of Elon Musk fuelled an \u2018ego exercise\u2019 that blew up in his face\nJust look at the fund\u2019s size. The total donated to climate-related causes in the U.S., which forms the major chunk of global giving, is about US$500 million annually, says Noah Deich, executive director of Carbon 180, an NGO focused on carbon removal. Even if Bezos were to hand out his sum over a 20-year period, he would likely double donations for the cause. That gives Bezos the power to heavily influence the direction that climate philanthropies take as a whole.But deploying all of that money effectively will be difficult, even if Bezos employs an army of climate experts. The model of mega-philanthropy comes with limits. In his recent book, Winners Take All, the writer Anand Giridharadas suggests that the best-intended billionaire giving likely has impacts only on the margins.Another potential problem is that there aren\u2019t that many organizations that can make good use of such large sums of capital, experts in the field say. For comparison, the Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club, two of the largest environmental organizations in the U.S., spend about US$200 million and US$85 million annually.What about scientific research? Donating a chunk of the fund to research could fit with Bezos\u2019s thinking behind the Blue Origin space venture, namely that the Earth is a\u00a0garden that we should protect by moving heavy industry to space. If instead, Bezos is thinking about supporting Earth-bound climate solutions, he only has to look at Gates, who has supported ventures\u00a0for years that have yet to make a big dent on the emissions curve.But in the end, most experts I spoke to say that the most effective use of Bezos\u2019s money could be on politics. The Instagram post says that he is interested in donating to \u201cactivists.\u201d But ultimately, governments have more power than anyone to bend the emissions curve through legislation and regulation. Even more than a man whose wealth is estimated at US$130 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Putting climate-friendly politicians into office in the U.S. and across the world could be the best way to do that.That is a \u201cstraightforward and unsophisticated\u201d way of trying to put the world back on track, says Noah Kaufman, a climate and energy economist at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.And it would probably cost a lot less than US$10 billion.Akshat Rathi writes the Net Zero newsletter on the intersection of climate science and emission-free tech.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Harry Wilson and Alfred Liu", "title": "HSBC to slash 35,000 staff in dramatic overhaul", "description": "'Parts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/hsbc-seeks-revamp-with-35000-staff-cuts-in-quinn-endgame", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hsbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 18, 2020 7:26 AM EST", "content": "HSBC Holdings Plc is set to slash about 35,000 staff from its workforce and is taking US$7.3 billion of charges in its most dramatic overhaul under Chairman Mark Tucker.The London-based lender is targeting cost reductions of US$4.5 billion at underperforming units in the U.S. and Europe. In the meantime, it will accelerate investments in Asia, where the bank draws the bulk of its profit but is grappling with risks from the Hong Kong protests and China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. The board is also deciding whether the sweeping overhaul announced by interim boss Noel Quinn is enough to secure him the top job permanently.\u201cParts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns,\u201d Quinn said in the bank\u2019s full-year earnings statement on Tuesday. Quinn, who is also exiting several business lines, also said staff numbers could drop by 15 per cent within the next three years.\u201cWe are looking at an endgame of closer to 200,000,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg.The cutbacks will extend into parts of HSBC\u2019s European and U.S. investment banking businesses, particularly in fixed income.

Questions have mounted over HSBC\u2019s relatively poor returns given its exposure to many of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, particularly China.\u201cWe are intending to exit a lot of domestically-focused customers in Europe and the U.S. on the global banking side,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said in a Bloomberg Television interview.

However, the bank warned the virus and economic disruption in Hong Kong may impact its 2020 performance.\u201cWhile reduced capital allocation to low-return businesses is a positive, we expect weaker profitability in what have traditionally been strong markets, primarily Hong Kong,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, maintaining their underweight rating on HSBC.Speculation had mounted months ago that Quinn was likely to get the CEO\u2019s role on a permanent basis, but that has faded. People familiar with the matter said earlier this month that HSBC was seriously considering external candidates.On the conference call, Tucker declined to clarify whether the bank is closer to finding its next CEO.Stevenson also said there was no update on HSBC\u2019s review of its French division.

HSBC had been forecast to report adjusted pretax profit of US$21.8 billion, according to analysts.

A decision, which was expected in the last two days, is now dragging on into Friday or beyond, the people said.The crux of the debate: whether to take the highest offer, from Finnish rival Kone Oyj, despite antitrust risks or go with competing bids from private-equity suitors that don\u2019t have competition issues. The deal would be the biggest acquisition in Europe this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nInside Brookfield\u2019s empire, a complicated jigsaw of $500 billion in assets spread across the world\nAnother WeWork rival lures cash from investors that include Brookfield, CPPIB\nBrookfield to take control of Canadian mortgage insurance giant in $2.4 billion deal with Genworth\nKone\u2019s consortium increased its bid to more than 17 billion euros (US$18.4 billion) in the latest round in an attempt to widen the gulf with its rivals, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Bidding groups led by Blackstone Group Inc., Advent International and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. each offered close to 16 billion euros, according to the people.Deteriorating FinancesThyssenkrupp, once an emblem of German industrial prowess, can barely afford to wait. The steelmaker has been bruised by a manufacturing slowdown and rising pension costs. The company on Thursday announced quarterly results that laid bare the company\u2019s rapidly deteriorating finances as debt surged and losses deepened.The three private equity bidders are each pitching why they\u2019d be the best owner. Blackstone, which teamed up with Carlyle Group Inc. and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, made the highest offer among the buyout groups by this week\u2019s deadline, according to the people. A consortium including Advent, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is touting its track record doing large German deals.Brookfield, which partnered with Temasek Holdings Pte, has told labour unions it plans to reinvest in the business, the people said. Discussions are ongoing, and suitors are still making tweaks to their offers, the people said.Representatives for Advent, Blackstone, Brookfield and Kone declined to comment. Thyssenkrupp has said it will make a decision by the end of February, according to a representative for the company, who declined to comment further.Antitrust ConcernsThyssenkrupp Chief Financial Officer Johannes Dietsch said Thursday a deal with a strategic investor would mean the company only receives the money after a long, thorough antitrust review. This must be taken into account when Thyssenkrupp decides the best way forward, Dietsch said on a conference call with reporters.Shares of Thyssenkrupp were up 1.1 per cent at 9:16 a.m. Friday in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of 7 billion euros.Finland\u2019s Kone, the only remaining strategic bidder, has tried hard to address concerns about a drawn-out competition review. It plans to hand the elevator operations in Europe to bidding partner CVC Capital Partners, while offering to fully assume any antitrust risks. It has also promised a multibillion-euro upfront payment that Thyssenkrupp would keep even if the deal is blocked by competition authorities, Bloomberg News reported last month.Some executives at Thyssenkrupp fear that heavy scrutiny from European antitrust authorities on a Kone bid would lead to months of delays and perhaps the ultimate failure of the deal. The German company\u2019s aborted attempt to merge its steel business with Tata Steel Europe still haunts executives, who thought European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager unfairly torpedoed the plans.Some private equity suitors have offered major Thyssenkrupp investors the chance to keep a minority stake in the elevator unit and have discussed plans to relist the business in Germany in a few years, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Patricia Hurtado", "title": "U.S. raises the stakes in battle with Huawei, adds racketeering conspiracy charge", "description": "New charges depict a company that won international standing by stealing trade secrets, evading U.S sanctions and lying to authorities", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/u-s-raises-the-stakes-in-battle-with-huawei-adds-racketeering-conspiracy-charge", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/huawei-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 13, 2020 2:28 PM EST", "content": "The U.S. raised the stakes in its battle with Huawei Technologies Co., using a law historically associated with prosecuting mafia figures to allege that the Chinese company engaged in decades of intellectual property theft.Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, were already facing criminal charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea, a case that has rippled into Canada, where the CFO is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. The new allegations, announced Thursday, ratchet up the potential penalties the world\u2019s largest maker of telecommunications equipment could face if convicted.The new charges depict a company that won international standing by stealing trade secrets, evading U.S sanctions and lying to authorities.

Huawei, in turn, has accused the government of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. The accusations have increased tensions between Huawei and the administration of President Donald Trump.Prosecutors in January 2019 charged Huawei and Meng with conspiracy to commit bank fraud for allegedly misleading banks about the company\u2019s doing business in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. In the new indictment, they allege that Huawei and three of its entities engaged in a racketeering scheme in New York, California, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey, Texas and Washington state.The U.S. also claims that Huawei conspired to steal trade secrets from multiple victim companies in a series of incidents dating back to 2002.Huawei faces separate charges in Seattle.The case is U.S. v.

Alstom and Bombardier could reach an agreement as early as this week, though talks could still be delayed or fall apart, according to people familiar with the matter. Alstom could pay about 7 billion euros (US$7.6 billion) for the rail business, Handelsblatt reported earlier, without saying where it got the information. The embattled manufacturer is also exploring the sale of its corporate-jet operation to Textron Inc., maker of Cessna planes, the Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 4.The Montreal-based company sold its turboprop-plane business to Longview Aviation Capital Corp. last year, and has agreements in place to offload its regional-jet operation and a wing plant in Northern Ireland. Those deals are on track to close in the first half of 2020, the company said in a statement Thursday as it reported a loss in line with expectations.Show MeAirbus is paying $591 million to Bombardier to raise its stake to 75 per cent. That, combined with the other aerospace divestitures, will bring in more than US$1.6 billion in cash and eliminate almost US$2 billion in liabilities, according to the statement.With positive free cash flow and the A220 divestiture, there are some positive elements for this \u201cshow me\u201d story, Stephen Trent and Brian Roberts, analysts at Citigroup Global Markets, said.\u201cAssuming that this smaller company now generates cash, it remains to be seen whether Bombardier further monetizes its remaining businesses, a potential positive catalyst \u2013 and a US$52.1 billion firm order book might be a good place to start the conversation,\u201d the analysts said.Caisse HoldingThe deal keeps about 3,300 Airbus jobs in Quebec while boosting the provincial government\u2019s share in the A220 to 25 per cent from 16 per cent for no cash. While Premier Francois Legault kept his promise not to add to the $1 billion his predecessor had poured into the plane less than four years ago, it\u2019s unclear how much of upcoming costs his government will shoulder. Bombardier said its future capital requirements for the single-aisle plane were estimated at US$700 million.\u201cWe are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact Bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry,\u201d Bellemare said in the statement. \u201cWe are equally proud of the responsible way in which we have exited commercial aerospace, preserving jobs and reinforcing the aerospace cluster in Quebec and Canada.Any rail deal will also get Quebec involved as the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, the province\u2019s influential pension fund manager, owns part of the Berlin-based train business. It spent US$1.5 billion in 2016 for the 30 per cent stake. That\u2019s now grown into a 32.5 per cent holding after the unit\u2019s results failed to reach the targets underlying Caisse\u2019s investment, Bombardier said Thursday.Bombardier reported an adjusted loss of 10 cents. Sales fell 2.3 per cent to US$4.21 billion.

There\u2019s little sign of that trend abating even as oil and gas companies face increasing scrutiny over the the roles they play in climate change.Much like their counterparts in the U.S. and globally, Canadian lenders are under pressure to show they\u2019re doing their part in fighting carbon emissions and rising temperatures. They want to show they\u2019re delivering on green promises they\u2019ve made, yet they\u2019re steadfast in supporting an industry that is key to Canada\u2019s resource-heavy economy.

Oil and gas loans accounted for an average of 5.2 per cent of corporate financing at the big banks in 2019, down from 6.3 per cent five years ago. Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank bucked that trend, with oil and gas loans representing a greater share of their corporate lending after acquiring energy books from foreign banks.The Canadian banks understand there's an issue here and they're trying to work on itLaura Zizzo \n \nBank of Montreal more than doubled oil and gas lending in five years, peaking at $13.5 billion last year, driven up by the 2018 purchase of energy loans from Deutsche Bank AG and an overall corporate-financing surge. Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said in a BNN Bloomberg television interview last month that the bank\u2019s support of legacy fossil-fuel clients helps them shift to a cleaner economy.\u201cIt\u2019s all about supporting leaders who want to transition over time \u2014 and it does take time, and it will take time \u2014 to a lower-carbon economy,\u201d White said.More Than DoubledAt Toronto-Dominion, Canada\u2019s second-largest lender by assets, loans to pipeline, oil and gas firms more than doubled to US$9.22 billion since 2014, though part of the jump was from the purchase of energy loans from Royal Bank of Scotland about four years ago.While the bank \u201cis actively supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d Toronto-Dominion is \u201caware that Canadians will rely on conventional energy sources for several more decades to sustain our economy, create jobs and support a standard of living for our customers and communities,\u201d spokeswoman Lynsey Wynberg said in a statement.\n\nRoyal Bank CEO Dave McKay.\n\nAl Charest/Postmedia News files\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada, the nation\u2019s largest lender, pared loans to the industry in 2016 and 2017, but they\u2019ve since climbed back steadily. Shifting to greener energy production requires a strong economy aided by contributions from the traditional energy sector, CEO Dave McKay said.\u201cYou need fossil-based fuels to make that transition,\u201d he said in a Bloomberg TV interview last month. \u201cThey\u2019re not going away overnight.\u201dScotiabank, CIBCMcKay\u2019s bank is hardly alone in its support of the industry. Bank of Nova Scotia had the most energy loans last year, while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CEO Victor Dodig in November gave his backing to Canada\u2019s energy companies, saying the bank \u201cwill be there to help address the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.\u201dAmong the country\u2019s largest lenders, National Bank of Canada is alone in shrinking its oil and gas loan book, to $2.75 billion last year from $3.62 billion in 2014. Such financing represented 4.4 per cent of overall corporate loans in 2019, almost half the portion five years earlier.Not all energy financing is equal, and more disclosures are needed to show whether loans are backing environmentally friendly projects, said Zizzo of Mantle314.\u201cWhen the banks are giving a facility to an energy company, they usually don\u2019t delineate if that\u2019s going toward something we should think about as transition or as propping up a mature and dirtier aspect of the energy sector,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a real conundrum.\u201d\n\nSuncor has set a target to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nTim Fraser/Postmedia Network files\n\nFossil-fuel companies themselves are under pressure to become greener. Suncor Energy Inc. and Cenovus Energy Inc. set goals of reducing their emissions per barrel of oil produced by 30 per cent by 2030, and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and MEG Energy Corp. have set long-term goals of net zero emissions from their oilsands operations.Canada\u2019s five biggest banks have each set targets that could support such efforts. Scotiabank was the latest, offering in November to \u201cmobilize\u201d US$100 billion by 2025 to reduce climate-change impacts. CIBC committed in September to support US$150 billion in environmental and sustainable finance activities by 2027, while Bank of Montreal said last June it would provide US$150 billion in capital by 2025 to companies pursuing sustainable outcomes.\u201cIt\u2019s really great to galvanize interest in the sustainable finance that\u2019s required,\u201d Zizzo said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really just a first step of what\u2019s needed.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Danielle Bochove", "title": "Barrick Gold boosts dividend by 40% after earnings beat highest analyst estimate", "description": "Miner says it will exceed target of selling $1.5 billion in assets by end of year", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/barrick-gold-ceo-expects-to-beat-1-5-billion-asset-sale-target", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/barrick.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 12, 2020 10:12 AM EST", "content": "Barrick Gold Corp., the world\u2019s second-largest producer of the metal, will exceed its target of selling US$1.5 billion in assets by the end of this year, chief executive Mark Bristow said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat it,\u201d Bristow said Wednesday in an interview following the release of the miner\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings. \u201cWe still have some work to tidy up the portfolio.\u201d The company has roughly US$450 million in sales to go to reach the US$1.5 billion mark, but expects to sell more than that this year, he said.The Toronto-based company had announced the initial asset-sales target in the wake of its US$5.4 billion acquisition of Randgold Resources Ltd. last year.

This has created a legal way for these companies to conduct research on otherwise illegal drugs, opening the door to public listings.In late 2018, the FDA gave \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d status to a psilocybin treatment developed by London-based Compass Pathways Ltd. for clinical depression, expediting the development process.Meanwhile, Toronto-based Mind Medicine is preparing a Phase 2 clinical trial into the use of a psychedelic called ibogaine to treat opioid addiction, which will be conducted in New York and governed by the FDA.Compass Pathways declined to comment on whether it\u2019s planning a public listing, but the company is \u201calways looking at options to ensure continued growth and funding,\u201d chief communications officer Tracy Cheung said in an email.The Canadian Securities Exchange, which has become the go-to bourse for U.S. cannabis companies that can\u2019t list in their home country, is also expecting listings from psychedelic drug companies in 2020.The FDA has \u201cgiven clearance for a variety of trials at this point and it looks like they are going to be expanding that framework,\u201d said Richard Carleton, CEO of the Canadian Securities Exchange. \u201cIf that is the case then I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll see our first issuers probably before the middle of the year.\u201dInstitutional capitalThere\u2019s growing investor interest in psychedelics, said Ronan Levy, executive chairman of Field Trip Psychedelics Inc.

It\u2019s also conducting research into psilocybin at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.Last week, Field Trip closed a Series A financing round that raised US$8.5 million from a variety of investors including cannabis-focused asset manager Silver Spike Capital and Harris Fricker, the former CEO of GMP Capital Inc., which helped a number of marijuana companies go public.The funding round attracted interest from all over the world, including \u201csome very large Silicon Valley tech investors and entrepreneurs,\u201d Levy said.Field Trip is considering a public listing, although Levy also sees further opportunities to raise private funding, he said.

This larger capacity will give the combined company an advantage as the industry transitions to the next generation of wireless technology, the much-faster 5G standard.The ruling comes almost two years after the deal was first announced. The states\u2019 lawsuit was the last major hurdle to the deal after it secured the blessing of regulators at the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. It still needs approvals from California\u2019s utility board and a federal judge in Washington who must sign off on the Justice Department settlement.Deutsche Telekom shares rose as much as 3.6 per cent to 15.40 euros in Frankfurt. Shares of Sprint soared 66 per cent to US$7.95 in pre-market trading in New York after closing at US$4.80 Monday in New York. T-Mobile extended gains to as much as 8.4 per cent to US$91.88.The ruling is also a victory for Dish Network Corp. co-founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen, who is buying assets from the two carriers to set up a new wireless network. With his company\u2019s core satellite TV business in decline, Ergen has amassed a trove of airwaves to build a state-of-the-art network.ConcessionsTo win federal approval, T-Mobile and Sprint had agreed to sell multiple assets to Dish in order to create a new fourth competitor. The new Dish wireless network will start life with about 9 million subscribers.T-Mobile and Sprint haven\u2019t renewed the merger agreement since it lapsed on Nov. 1. And while there have been \u201cnot hostile\u201d discussions of several issues, including price, T-Mobile has suggested there could be new terms.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere said last week he was still optimistic that the deal would go through, though the terms could change. If the agreement needs to be amended, \u201cincluding possibly price, we would handle that very swiftly after the deal was approved,\u201d he said.As far as negotiation leverage goes, Sprint\u2019s in a tough spot, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst with LightShed Partners. \u201cSprint has no alternative but to take whatever DT and T-Mobile offers them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else they can do.\u201dT-Mobile and Sprint had been the most aggressive U.S. wireless companies in terms of price competition in recent years, forcing AT&T and Verizon to follow moves like ending service contracts and adopting unlimited data plans. The proposed combination came under fire from lawmakers and consumer advocates who said it would lead to higher prices and fewer services, especially for poor and rural consumers. The companies had pursued a combination for several years, but a proposed deal was twice rejected as anti-competitive under the previous administration. After the FCC approved the deal, the all-Democratic group of attorneys general filed suit. The Justice Department then gave its approval, leading to a rare split between states and the federal government over antitrust enforcement.\u201cThis is exactly the sort of consumer-harming, job-killing mega-merger our antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the time.Tackling ConcernsLegere tried to address these concerns by promising to not raise prices for three years. He is credited with helping to remake T-Mobile into an industry maverick, and pitched the Sprint takeover as a way to compete against industry leaders Verizon and AT&T.Legere announced in November that he will be handing off the job to Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert in May, but plans to remain on the combined company\u2019s board.One of their central pitches was that the deal would advance the introduction of 5G. The companies pledged to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in May that they would deploy a 5G network covering 97 per cent of the U.S. population within three years and 99 per cent within six.With assistance from Stefan Nicola, Chris Dolmetsch and Courtney Dentch.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michael Bellusci", "title": "Brookfield seen as \u2018dark horse' buyer for Trans Mountain pipeline", "description": "Asset management firm has funds to buy project whose price tag has jumped 70%, analyst says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/brookfield-seen-as-dark-horse-buyer-for-trudeaus-pipeline", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/brookfield.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 10, 2020 12:37 PM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain oil-pipeline expansion is no bargain after a multibillion-dollar increase in the cost of the project.

That trend reversed sharply in January, with sales rising 4.8 per cent during the month on a seasonally adjusted basis to the highest level in more than a year.The average sale price for a detached homes was $1,038,247 in January, up 10.5 per cent from a year earlier.

Tesla had added 36 per cent to its value in the first two days of the week, but by Wednesday afternoon, it was just 7.7 per cent higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12 per cent above Friday\u2019s close.The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an \u201celectrifying run\u201d on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.Tesla shares have \u201chad a Bitcoin-like move and profits are being taken off the table with technical levels being hit,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. The analyst expects the stock to settle in the US$700 range and start moving higher again on the potential of its China business, despite coronavirus fears. \nWill Tesla stock run out of fuel soon or can it rocket to US$7,000 \u2014 or even beyond?\nTesla\u2019s stock price streak leaves analysts struggling to keep up\nTesla shares could hit $960 in early 2021, company\u2019s biggest bull says\nThe rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.\u201cLook, everybody has a pain threshold,\u201d Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television\u2019s Tom Keene Wednesday. \u201cWhen a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.\u201d The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.A sense of caution and some confusion prevailed in the market.\u201cMany investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been \u201ccalm, curious and overall cautious.\u201dThat sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping US$109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at US$887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112 per cent. Wednesday\u2019s selloff would pare that back to an year-to-date gain of 73 per cent.Wall Street is pedalling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity\u2019s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely \u201creset of expectations\u201d in the first quarter and flagging China\u2019s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added US$17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.Wednesday\u2019s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing US$11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including US$5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners\u2019 Ihor Dusaniwsky.

In just the past week, he sold 0.2 per cent of the retailer for US$1.8 billion.Bezos offloaded 905,456 Amazon shares on Friday and Monday under a pre-arranged trading plan, according to filings. That brings his total stock sales to about US$12 billion, with two-thirds of those occurring in the past four years, according to calculations by Bloomberg.The scale of the recent sales \u2014 including US$2 billion in 2017 and US$2.8 billion in 2019 \u2014 partly reflects Amazon\u2019s soaring valuation, which closed above US$1 trillion for the first time on Tuesday.

That includes hitting the red carpet with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, hosting a bash at his Washington mansion for the political and financial elite, and even being part of an international controversy after the incendiary claim that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was involved in hacking his phone.It\u2019s a far cry from the low profile Bezos cultivated for years. Like fellow Seattle billionaire Bill Gates, he showed little interest in matching the glitzy lifestyle of other tech titans, such as Oracle Corp.\u2019s Larry Ellison, whose purchases have included a Hawaiian island and super-yacht.That doesn\u2019t mean Bezos hasn\u2019t spent boatloads of money. As well as properties on both coasts, he has his own rural getaway: 170,000 hectares of desert scrub in Texas, where he indulges his passion for space exploration. He\u2019s previously said that he\u2019s funding rocket company Blue Origin LLC with about US$1 billion a year through the sale of Amazon stock.\u201cThe price of admission to space is very high,\u201d Bezos said in 2018, accepting the Buzz Aldrin Space Exploration Award at the Explorers Club Annual Dinner. \u201cI\u2019m in the process of converting my Amazon lottery winnings into a much lower price of admission so we can go explore the Solar System.\u201dThat still leaves plenty left over for other pursuits, from the Washington Post to a clock built in the Sierra Diablo mountain range in Texas that\u2019s designed to run for 10,000 years.

This equates to 10 per cent or fewer of eligible customers, he wrote, a take rate he called \u201csurprisingly low.\u201d Apple hasn\u2019t disclosed subscriber numbers for the TV+ service.Sacconaghi speculated that Apple TV+ may be \u201cfailing to resonate with customers, perhaps due to its limited content offerings.\u201d Unlike other streaming services such as Netflix Inc. or Amazon Prime, which offer reruns to well-known content, Apple only offers original shows on its service, with \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d being the most high profile.

In meetings, the Amazon.com Inc. chief expressed envy for how Musk had pitted five Western states against one another in a bidding war for thousands of manufacturing jobs; he wondered why Amazon was okay with accepting comparatively trifling incentives. It was a theme Bezos returned to often, according to four people privy to his thinking. Then in 2017, an Amazon executive sent around a congratulatory email lauding his team for landing US$40 million in government incentives to build a US$1.5 billion air hub near Cincinnati. The paltry sum irked Bezos, the people say, and made him even more determined to try something new.And so, when Amazon launched a bakeoff for a second headquarters in September 2017, the company made plain that it was looking for government handouts in exchange for a pledge to invest US$5 billion and hire 50,000 people. The splashy reality-television-style contest generated breathless media coverage, attracted fawning bids from 238 cities across North America and ended with Amazon deciding to split the so-called HQ2 between New York and Virginia. Then progressive politicians attacked the US$3 billion in incentives offered by New York, and Bezos pulled out. Amazon was widely ridiculed for its failure to court New York politicians. To understand why that happened, Bloomberg interviewed 12 people familiar with Amazon\u2019s effort. Their story, outlined here for the first time, depicts a team that became the victim of its own hubris. Bezos\u2019s frustration with what he deemed meagre government largess prompted executives to scrap lessons learned through the years in favour of an unapologetic appeal for tax breaks and other incentives. \nAmazon abandons plan to build HQ2 in New York\n\u2018They\u2019ve duped all of us\u2019: Amazon\u2019s multiple HQ2s move it closer to its destiny as the everything company\nAmazon plans to split HQ2 between two cities, sources say \u2014 and neither of them are Toronto\nEmployees with\u00a0experience negotiating deals around the country anticipated problems, but their red flags were ignored by those eager to please Bezos with a new playbook for a big win.\u00a0Secretive and walled off from the rest of the company, according to people familiar with the situation, the HQ2 team members marinated in the headlines and hoopla and persuaded themselves Amazon would be welcomed anywhere.That\u00a0blinkered assumption continues to resonate today, not least among\u00a0city officials across the continent who felt manipulated by Amazon, according to people familiar with their thinking. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers\u00a0is considering a non-aggression pact\u00a0to halt the kind of tax-incentive bidding war unleashed during the HQ2 process. \u201cThis entire thing was an ego exercise that blew up in Jeff Bezos\u2019s face,\u201d says one of the people.In an emailed statement, Amazon said the company has invested US$270 billion in 40 states and created more than 500,000 jobs with competitive wages, benefits and employee training. \u201cWe partner with hundreds of communities across the country to bring them new jobs and investment. Like many other companies, we are eligible to access incentive programs created and regulated by cities and states to attract new investors \u2014 as they know that these investments pay a long-term dividend in the form of jobs, new economic opportunity, and incremental tax revenue.\u201dThis entire thing was an ego exercise that blew up in Jeff Bezos's face \n \nFor years, Amazon\u2019s economic development team followed a well-trod process, dubbed the \u201cwelcome wagon\u201d internally and developed as the company began building warehouses in towns and cities around the U.S. To head off concerns about traffic, working conditions and competition with local mom-and-pop shops, executives hosted informational meetings, inviting residents and stakeholders to ask questions. Sometimes, Amazon arranged for officials to travel to other cities to see its warehouses first-hand and speak with employees and local leaders. All the while, the public-relations team cultivated relationships with advocates willing to tell the media why they favoured the project.Windsor, Connecticut, Mayor Don Trinks recalls\u00a0how Amazon eased anxieties in his town near Hartford before\u00a0opening\u00a0a warehouse there in 2016. When news of the project broke, residents panicked about truck traffic. Amazon hosted meetings around town and answered every question. \u201cThe public perception was a big company like Amazon will come in and steamroll our little town, but nothing could\u2019ve been further from the truth,\u201d says Trinks, who has been mayor for almost 20 years and owns a small restaurant. \u201cTheir outreach was very impressive. They took the hard questions and jumped right in front of everything.\u201d\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos in September 2018.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images files\n\nBezos decided the HQ2 process would be handled differently. It wasn\u2019t just Musk\u2019s Nevada experience that got him fixated on extracting more government subsidies. He had also watched Boeing Co. win an US$8.7-billion handout from Washington state in 2013 \u2014 only to scale back its workforce over the next several years. Meanwhile, Amazon was getting no state money despite hiring thousands of people and was tangling with Seattle City Council, which blamed the company for making the city too expensive. Besides angling for government generosity for HQ2, Bezos also told his team to seek US$1 billion in breaks for other Amazon projects, according to someone familiar with the situation. The economic development team had failed to meet its financial targets in each of the previous several years, the person says. (The Wall Street Journal first reported the US$1 billion target.) An Amazon spokeswoman disputed that the company has goals for government incentives.The notion of a second headquarters grew out of the realization that, over the years, Amazon had\u00a0opened satellite offices around the country with little rhyme or reason, according to a person close to the process. Bezos\u2019s senior executives decided it would be better\u00a0to pick one\u00a0location that could absorb headcount needs for the next decade. Amazon\u00a0had been quietly scouting cities and had already identified 25 that could accommodate about 20,000 employees, according to\u00a0the people.\u00a0 The company could have whittled down that list and negotiated with select finalists. Instead, Bezos pushed for the bakeoff. Musk had enticed five states into a bidding war; Bezos would open his contest to all of North America, even if putting a second HQ in Canada or Columbus, Ohio,\u00a0was unlikely.A team that included real estate chief John Schoettler drew up a request for proposals, highlighting such must-haves as an airport with direct flights to Seattle and good universities. The word \u201cincentive\u201d was used 21 times. Some team members cringed, worried that Amazon would come across as tone-deaf given Bezos\u2019s wealth, not to mention triggering a national debate over income inequality. They knew officials would offer tax breaks regardless. Demanding them left Amazon exposed to accusations of corporate greed.But the naysayers were quickly hushed and sent to work on other projects. The remaining members of the team\u00a0believed any fallout would be short-lived and overshadowed by the sheer size of Amazon\u2019s investment.Led by public policy chief Brian Huseman and economic development director Holly Sullivan, the HQ2 team commandeered a\u00a0small\u00a0Washington office and retreated behind a wall of secrecy.\u00a0The windows were blacked out, and\u00a0Huseman warned non-team members that anyone entering the room would be punished, according to one of the people.\u00a0Information was tightly controlled to prevent leaks.One evening in January 2018, members of the team got an email ordering them to report to the office early the next morning. It was time to trim the list of more than 200 HQ2 contenders. Huseman reminded the team that anyone leaking information to the media would be identified and fired. They each got a stack of cities to call and instructions to let the officials down gently by telling them they had submitted an enticing proposal. Much like job applicants, the deflated officials thanked Amazon for being considered and fished for clues as to why they didn\u2019t make the cut, according to someone who made the calls.The 20 finalists largely overlapped with the existing list of 25 potential locations, according to people familiar with the matter. Leaving in smaller cities like Indianapolis and Columbus, even though few team members took them seriously, helped Amazon send a message that all cities had a chance, according to one of the people involved on the project. Maintaining the competitive frenzy took priority over further narrowing the list, which would have let Amazon focus on relationships. The prevailing sentiment inside the HQ2 team after cutting hundreds of communities: that was tough, but necessary. They were mostly relieved to be one step closer to completing the search and celebrated with beer and wine in the kitchen of the\u00a0Washington office.Despite Amazon\u2019s efforts to keep the operation contained internally, the fallout spilled into other departments. City and state officials\u00a0privately complained to their Amazon contacts\u00a0that\u00a0the exercise was a tremendous waste of public resources, according to a person who received the complaints. Mayors and governors said they had other businesses genuinely interested in their cities and states and lamented that Amazon was stringing the entire continent along, the person said.Mayors and governors ... lamented that Amazon was stringing the entire continent along \n \nThe frustration spread beyond North America after Amazon\u2019s bid for big tax breaks became international news. One Amazon executive warned that officials in Europe where the company was trying to expand were asking how long it would be before Bezos\u00a0asked them for tax breaks as well. These concerns made their way up the ranks to Amazon Web Services chief Andy Jassy,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the matter.In September 2018, executives decided to split the new headquarters between\u00a0New York and Virginia. Before going public,\u00a0Amazon quietly\u00a0 tied up real estate deals and government agreements\u00a0in the two locations,\u00a0mindful that local real estate prices could spike if the media got wind of it. The prioritization of secrecy over building alliances proved fatal in New York. When the news finally leaked,\u00a0Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer\u2019s phone lit up. Van Bramer was supportive of\u00a0efforts to draw Amazon, but quickly became an opponent once he realized that Amazon, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio\u00a0had cut him and other local officials out of the process. Van Bramer sought clarity from the governor and mayor but says he was ghosted and misled. His ire increased upon learning that there were no plans to seek\u00a0city council approval.\u201cI was angry because something so massively important had been decided and no one had bothered to tell local elected officials or anyone else who had a big stake in this,\u201d Van Bramer says. \u201cWe had been excluded from the process.\u201dHe was further incensed upon learning of the subsidies Amazon would receive, including a US$500-million grant to help pay for the new headquarters. That week, Van Bramer travelled to Puerto Rico, where he bumped into New York State Senator Michael Gianaris in the lobby of the El San Juan Hotel. Over a Medalla\u00a0 beer, they vented and agreed to fight the project. The pair got help from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has long considered Amazon\u2019s online shopping business a threat to its members. Fuelling the tension was a new Amazon warehouse in Staten Island where some workers wanted to organize.Amazon representatives sought meetings with\u00a0city and state officials, but Gianaris declined and Van Bramer met with them only once, according to an\u00a0Amazon executive familiar with the process.\u00a0This person says Amazon didn\u2019t involve\u00a0City Council because getting approval would have taken years and because other major projects such as the Hudson Yards redevelopment had gone through the state. Moreover, this person says, Amazon representatives received a warm welcome during a site visit.The extent of the hostility didn\u2019t reveal itself until Huseman appeared before the city council in December 2018, where he was jeered and interrupted. Back in Seattle, Amazonians watched the livestream in disbelief, texting one another about how Huseman came off as robotic, inauthentic and out of touch. Huseman fell back on job figures and dollar signs but there wasn\u2019t enough to humanize the project. The ultimate breaking point came when he said the company wouldn\u2019t remain neutral if employees tried to organize unions. He appeared oblivious to the political climate in New York, where the children of union janitors and labourers get elected to run the city. Amazon\u2019s negotiating strategy, internally summarized as \u201cF*** you. We\u2019re Amazon,\u201d had met its match.\n\nProtestors rally against Amazon and the company\u2019s plans to move their second headquarters to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, at New York City Hall, January 30, 2019 in New York City.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images files\n\nThe beginning of the end came when Gianaris was recommended for a seat on the state\u2019s Public Authorities Control Board, which had the power to influence the deal. Gianaris was never confirmed for the seat, but his nomination was a game changer. Gianaris says he requested the appointment because\u00a0\u201cthe Amazon project was in my district, and I saw this as the only tool available to have any real input into what was about to go down.\u201dThere were some last-minute meetings to attempt to bridge the divide and even some whispers that Amazon had capitulated and agreed to remain neutral in employee union campaigns. Amazon saved the breakup news for Valentine\u2019s Day, saying that \u201ca number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project.\u201dLooking back, some Amazon employees say\u00a0they shouldn\u2019t have\u00a0blindly assumed that Amazon would be welcomed everywhere, but still see signs of success in the 25,000 jobs to come in Virginia and 5,000 in Nashville, Tennessee. Others involved in the process say executives tied their hands by prioritizing secrecy over relationship-building. \u201cNegotiating incentives is easy,\u201d one says. \u201cWhat\u2019s hard is winning hearts and minds and Amazon didn\u2019t do anything to win hearts and minds.\u201dStill, Bezos can take comfort from one aspect of the HQ2 saga.

Officials urged investors to evaluate objectively the impact of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 360 and spread to more than 17,000 people in China alone.The sell-off was widespread on Monday: commodity futures from iron ore to crude sank by the daily limit, and the yuan weakened past a key level against the dollar.Fund managers hit the phones to calm investors, seeking to avoid the kind of redemptions and forced selling seen as recently as 2018. China\u2019s securities regulator took steps to support the stock market, telling some brokerages that their proprietary traders aren\u2019t allowed to be net sellers of equities this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201cMy biggest concern was that investors would rush to redeem their holdings in private and mutual funds,\u201d said Jiang Liangqing, a money manager at Ruisen Capital Management in Beijing whose team is working from home across China. \u201cA key task for us is to reassure our fund holders and ask them to stay calm.\u201dSome avoided the market altogether, deciding there was no point trying to get orders through if it meant selling at such a deep discount.\u201cI had a look at stocks at the open, grabbed my fishing pole right after and left home,\u201d said Yin Ming, Shanghai-based vice president of investment firm Baptized Capital. \u201cWhat else can you do?

The company was spending far more than it was generating in revenue and suffered from an over-dependence on Neumann, who took out loans from WeWork as it paid him rent on buildings he owned.

A woman in her 20s arrived from Wuhan via Toronto on Jan. 23 and went to London, Ontario, developing symptoms a day later. She was first tested negative, but a second test confirmed the virus.Uncertainty about the severity and duration of the outbreak has left economists and analysts making best-guess estimates. Many are reaching back to the SARS outbreak of 2003 for pointers on how things could play out, but China\u2019s economy is now 10 times larger compared with 17 years ago.

Chairman Richard Baker was in talks about selling the Canadian retailer\u2019s stake in its European business when he started to formulate his own plan to take the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue private, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.The document offers a look into Baker\u2019s role in the sale of Hudson\u2019s Bay\u2019s stake in a joint venture with Signa Holding GmbH that operates German department stores, as well as his subsequent interactions with the board. Proceeds from the Signa deal were needed to help secure financing for the take-private deal, which will be voted on by shareholders next month.The additional disclosure was mandated by the Ontario Securities Commission in a ruling last month before Baker and his partners could proceed with their efforts to acquire the remainder of the company they didn\u2019t already own. \nHudson\u2019s Bay names new president of its namesake chain after 10-month vacancy\nA deal for Hudson\u2019s Bay Company is finally close, but is Canada\u2019s oldest retailer worth saving?\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co shares shoot up 9% after Richard Baker sweetens bid\nIt illustrates how Baker and his partners moved forward amid a landscape complicated by the declining fortunes of department stores and intense scrutiny from minority investors. Baker and his partners say the deal will give the company greater flexibility to adapt as consumers migrate away from department stores and to online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc.The Baker group sweetened its bid this month to roughly $2 billion (US$1.5 billion) and reached a truce with investor Catalyst Capital Group, which had opposed the deal\u2019s original terms and filed a complaint with regulators. At the time, Catalyst voiced concerns about the process, including Baker\u2019s interactions with the board. The new proposal will go to a shareholder vote on Feb. 27.Parallel TalksAccording to the filing, Baker was part of a group of Hudson\u2019s Bay representatives that began exploratory talks to sell the Canadian retailer\u2019s remaining 50 per cent stake in its venture with Signa during February of last year. Shortly after those discussions began, Baker started talks of his own with other Hudson\u2019s Bay shareholders about potentially using some of the proceeds from the sale to help take the retailer private.Baker and his partners determined that without the proceeds from the deal with Signa, they would unlikely be able to raise the necessary debt to take Hudson\u2019s Bay private.In March, Baker informed the board\u2019s lead director, David Leith, of his plans to explore taking Hudson\u2019s Bay private. Leith agreed to share limited financial information to Baker and his partners at that time on a confidential basis before informing other board members the following day.A special committee of the board was then established to review the Signa deal and other possible transactions. The committee did not include Baker or fellow executive, Ian Putnam, who was part of the group trying to take the company private, the document shows.\u201cWhile the special committee was aware that any privatization proposal, if received, would be conditional on the Signa transactions, the Signa transactions were not conditional on a privatization transaction proceeding,\u201d the filing states.The filing also shows how much Baker, his fellow board members, and management will earn through the sale of their options in the deal. The board will make roughly US$26.6 million from the sale, including US$8.7 million for Baker and US$10.2 million for Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes. Baker and the other conflicted directors will roll over their stake in the privatization, the document shows.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Tom Maloney and Tom Metcalf", "title": "Jeff Bezos added $13.2 billion to his fortune in only 15 minutes", "description": "He's now worth about US$129.5 billion", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/jeff-bezos-adds-13-2-billion-to-his-fortune-in-just-minutes", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/jeff-bezos-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 31, 2020 11:01 AM EST", "content": "Jeff Bezos just got a whole lot richer.Shares of his Amazon.com Inc. surged 12 per cent to US$2,100 in extended trading at 4:16 p.m. Thursday in New York, after the largest U.S. e-commerce company reported fourth-quarter results that smashed Wall Street estimates.Bezos, already the world\u2019s richest person, added US$13.2 billion to his fortune in about 15 minutes.

CAPP attributes the expected gain to tax cuts implemented by Alberta\u2019s new government, an easing of the province\u2019s output limits and efforts in neighbouring Saskatchewan to boost output.\u201cIt has been a tough five years, and Canada has not fared well at a time when global demand continues to rise,\u201d CAPP Chief Executive Officer Tim McMillan said in an interview. \u201cIt has taken some hard work, especially at the provincial level, to change the global view and put Canada back in a position where it can start to attract appropriate levels of capital again.\u201d \nDecision on Teck\u2019s massive $20.6-billion oilsands project could be delayed, environment minister says\nA clause in the U.S.\u2013China trade deal presents a big opportunity for the oilsands\n\u2018Money is starting to come back:\u2019 Investors look to Canada as shine comes off U.S. shale oil\nExpenditures for Canada\u2019s oil and natural gas sector as a whole may increase 5.4 per cent to $37 billion. Outside the oilsands, spending is projected to rise 4.1 per cent to $25.4 billion.The additional $2 billion in capital spending this year will create or sustain about 11,800 direct and indirect jobs across Canada, the organization projected. About 8,100 of those jobs will be in Alberta, which has struggled with elevated unemployment since the 2014 price crash.Even with this year\u2019s increase, the industry is still a long way from its headiest days. The projected oil-sands spending for 2020 is about one-third of the peak of $33.9 billion in 2014, according to CAPP figures.\u201cIn business terms, the spending increase is important enough to recognize,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cBut just as important, it\u2019s the changing of the trajectory from consistently losing capital investment to turning that around.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Toronto builders try a new tactic to\u00a0lure millennials to the hated suburbs.

The phenomenon has been dubbed \u201chipsturbia.\u201d\u201cDowntown Toronto is going to continue to thrive, but I think subway connected, suburban-urban locations are going to see a bit of a rebound in the next three to five years,\u201d Sean Menkes, director of office and retail at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd. \nOxford and AIMCo target Mississauga to develop 'largest mixed-use downtown development' in Canada\nRich, aging baby boomers will make it even harder for millennials to buy homes over next 10 years\nMillennials\u2019 shift to the suburbs will drive up Canadian home prices next year, Royal LePage says\nMenkes is working with public-pension manager British Columbia Investment Management Corp. on two projects in Vaughan, a suburb northwest of Toronto. Festival, a four-tower community with 85,000 square feet of retail, will follow last year\u2019s launch of Mobilio. Both are located around Vaughan\u2019s new transit-oriented city centre.West of Toronto in Mississauga, Oxford Properties Group and Alberta Investment Management Corp. unveiled plans this month to turn 130 acres near a shopping mall into the \u201cSquare One District,\u201d an 18 million-square-foot neighbourhood for 35,000 people that they call the largest mixed-use development in Canadian history.

Lee has been managing the papers for Buffett\u2019s company since 2018, and Berkshire is loaning Lee the money for the purchase.Buffett, who got a job delivering papers as a teenager and invested in the industry to capitalize on its one-time local advertising stronghold, lamented last year that most newspapers are \u201ctoast.\u201d BH Media, which owns papers across the country, has been cutting jobs for years to cope with declining ad revenue.We believe that Lee is best positioned to manage through the industry's challengesWarren Buffett \n \n\u201cWe had zero interest in selling the group to anyone else for one simple reason: We believe that Lee is best positioned to manage through the industry\u2019s challenges,\u201d Buffett said in a statement Wednesday.Mary E. Junck, the chairman of Lee Enterprises\u2019 board of directors, is also on the board of Postmedia Network Inc., which owns the Financial Post.In 2018, Buffett acknowledged that he was surprised that the decline in demand for newspapers hadn\u2019t let up and that his company hadn\u2019t found a successful strategy to combat falling advertising and circulation. That same year, U.S. newspaper circulation dropped to its lowest levels since 1940, according to the Pew Research Center. \nThe couple who scammed Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway for millions\nHome Capital looks for second act after its remarkable bounce back from the brink\nStill betting on Warren Buffett: Berkshire Hathaway and 9 other stocks that could break out in 2020\nThe Lee sale will include Buffett\u2019s hometown Omaha World-Herald and Buffalo News, a paper he\u2019s owned for more than four decades, along with 49 weekly publications and a number of other print products, the companies said in the statement. Lee\u2019s shares jumped on the news, more than doubling to US$2.78 at 9:51 a.m. in New York.Lee LoanBerkshire is lending Lee US$576 million at a 9 per cent annual rate for the purchase and to refinance other debt. Excluded from the sale is BH Media\u2019s real estate, which Lee is leasing under a 10-year agreement.It\u2019s a rare move for the conglomerate as Buffett has long said that he prefers to hold onto businesses. The newspaper deal, however, is Berkshire\u2019s second divestiture in less than a year, including the sale of an insurance business in late 2019. Berkshire has held onto other old-fashioned businesses, including door-to-door vacuum-cleaner business Kirby Co. and encyclopedia publisher World Book.Buffett has longstanding ties to the newspaper industry. He previously owned the Omaha Sun, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of Boys Town, and struck a deal to buy the World-Herald in 2011. The billionaire investor also had a long friendship with and was a business coach to Katharine Graham, and was a director at her Washington Post Co.Aside from a few bright spots, such as the largely thriving New York Times Co., the newspaper business is in crisis across the U.S. McClatchy Co. \u2014 which owns about 30 newspapers, including the Miami Herald and Charlotte Observer \u2014 is fighting to avoid bankruptcy as it contends with pension obligations and debt. The Salt Lake Tribune became a nonprofit last year, after failing to find a profitable business model.As print advertising has cratered in recent years amid the rise of social media, Craigslist and search ads, private equity firms and hedge funds have swooped in to take advantage of newspapers\u2019 steady though dwindling revenue streams.New Media Investment Group Inc., controlled by private equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, bought USA Today owner Gannett Co. last year to form the largest U.S. newspaper chain.

The pipeline operator has previously said its proposal to the CER represents 18 months of discussions with a variety of shippers and is the best compromise of their competing views.Enbridge is seeking to be able to lock customers on the Mainline into contracts for as long as 20 years, a shift from the current system in which space is allocated on a monthly basis. The company has said long-term contracts will provide shippers with certainty on tolls and market access.The Explorers & Producers Association of Canada, which represents mostly small- and mid-sized producers, also asked the CER on Tuesday to split the review process in two. The regulator should address other matters in Enbridge\u2019s application, such as tolls, only once the fundamental issue of a switch to contract service is decided.\u201cThe Enbridge Application is proposing a monumental change that has the potential to change the face of Canadian oil markets for decades,\u201d EPAC President Tristan Goodman said in its filing. \u201cTherefore, the preliminary issue of the appropriateness of converting the Enbridge Mainline to firm service should be carefully considered as a threshold question by a process that is efficient, inclusive and consistent with the public interest.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan and Doug Alexander", "title": "Canada's strong job market is being fuelled by men", "description": "More than 193,000 males took new jobs in Canada last year, almost double the number of females", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/as-u-s-men-lag-in-job-market-their-canadian-peers-win-big", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/constructioin.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 29, 2020 10:08 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s job market has been firing on all cylinders but it\u2019s been especially strong for men.More than 193,000 males took new jobs in Canada last year, almost double the number of females, pushing the unemployment rate for men below 6 per cent for the first time since records began in 1976. The figures mark a divergence from the U.S., where women eclipsed men as the majority of jobholders.The fastest pace of immigration in the Group of Seven is a big factor behind the trend in Canada, spurring a housing boom that\u2019s pushing up demand for everything from plumbers to electricians. A fast-track visa process is also pulling in workers to the male-dominated field of technology, while male immigrants are more likely than women to work outside the home. \nCanada\u2019s economy has \u2018free money lying on the sidewalk\u2019 and nobody is picking it up\nCanada\u2019s economy just had its second-best year for jobs since 2007\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nCanada notched another solid year of job gains in 2019, with the unemployment rate hovering near a four-decade low of 5.6 per cent. The female unemployment rate dipped even lower than men, reaching a record 4.9 per cent in May but the big job gains have skewed male.Jared Menkes, executive vice president at Toronto-based Menkes Developments Ltd., said finding enough labour is a constant source of angst. Central Toronto posted the fastest-growing population in North America last year with a dozen office buildings and countless condos under construction, along with 25 light rail stations, hospitals and all sorts of infrastructure work.\u201cWe are short actual labour, whether it\u2019s a crane operator, whether it\u2019s drywallers, electricians, plumbers, drivers,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cWe\u2019re short truck drivers, architects, consultants.\u201dOntario LeadsTo be sure, the headline figures mask stark regional disparities that underscore the difficulties Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing. Much of the job creation has been in central Canada while parts of the West struggle with a slump in the energy sector that has gutted thousands of jobs. Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau\u2019s Liberals push to reduce Canada\u2019s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 \u2014 sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O\u2019Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario\u2019s resurgence.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in life,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto\u2019s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think since this job started I\u2019ve worked less than a 60-hour week.\u201d\n\nThe CIBC Square tower under construction in Toronto.\n\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg files\n\nJust under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has also clamped down on visas for the high-tech sector, a source of jobs growth in Canada.Male immigrants are more likely to participate in the workforce than women, who often face additional barriers, according to Parisa Mahboubi, a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto.\u201cGenerally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cHowever, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.\u201dTech ManiaThe broad-ranging category of \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical services,\u201d which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn\u2019t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that\u2019s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, managing director at hireVouch \n \nPatrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can\u2019t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.\u201cAlmost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hardest time if you\u2019re an employer, but if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.\u201dOutlookRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.\u201cA growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can\u2019t find work,\u201d Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O\u2019Neill, the crane operator, doesn\u2019t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.\u201cShe\u2019s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, too.

In the process, they\u2019re getting harder to come by.A shortage of the smaller birds derailed the Popeyes challenge to reigning champion Chick-fil-A last summer, and most petite poultry are sold in grocery stores, not in chain restaurants. Now the supply will be further tested as more competitors jump into the fray. McDonald\u2019s Corp., the world\u2019s biggest restaurant chain, is testing new fried-chicken sandwiches in four U.S. cities with the added pop of MSG, a controversial flavour enhancer it says it doesn\u2019t use in its national menu.

There\u2019s \u201cincreasing consumer demand for smaller, premium-quality birds.\u201dChickens have been the most popular meat in America for a long time. More chicken is devoured in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world \u2014 an average of 93.5 pounds per person last year, according to the National Chicken Council. The birds have been getting progressively bigger over the years. Today\u2019s broiler varieties, the ones raised for meat, average more than 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms) each. In 1925, they weighed 2.5 pounds.So how did these fast-food chains so quickly find success with their chicken sandwiches? Birds lighter than 4.25 pounds.Small Is BeautifulThe summer skirmish focused Big Chicken\u2019s attention on the smaller and less plentiful variety. Breasts from wee birds recently reached triple the cost of breasts from a \u201cjumbo\u201d nine-pounder, a historically wide difference, according to Russ Whitman of commodity researcher Urner Barry.When it comes to sandwiches, small is beautiful. Cutting up a bigger portion takes labour, and what does one do with the trim? Restaurants want product that comes ready to go at the right specifications, said David Maloni, executive vice president of analytics at supply-chain consultant ArrowStream.\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to get that\u201d smaller bird, \u201cso they\u2019re paying a premium,\u201d Maloni said. The fast-food chains won\u2019t settle for bigger birds, he said.Consumers don't want tough and tasteless big chickensScott Sechler, owner of poultry producer Bell & Evans \n \nChick-fil-A total sales at its 2,470 locations rose 13 per cent last year, boosted by the closely held chain\u2019s fried-chicken sandwich, according to Technomic data. The company\u2019s ascendancy led Mark Kalinowski of Kalinowski Equity Research to say that Chick-fil-A poses \u201cthe largest competitive threat\u201d to McDonald\u2019s in the U.S.Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc., said the demand for its new sandwich last summer was so overwhelming that it ran through what it thought would be several months of supply in 14 days. It took until November for the company to bring the sandwich back. In the third-quarter of 2019, same-store U.S. Popeyes sales rose 10 per cent to one of the highest levels in two decades.Cheetos SandwichKFC, operated by Yum! Brands Inc., took a hit, with comparable sales dropping last quarter. In October, the chain said its limited-time Cheetos-chicken sandwich didn\u2019t catch on with customers and led to the decline. KFC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, on the other hand, have been gearing up. Late last year, McDonald\u2019s began testing new chicken sandwiches in a couple hundred restaurants, mostly in Houston, Seattle, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Augusta, Georgia.Like Chick-fil-A, Popeyes and KFC \u2014 but not Wendy\u2019s \u2014 McDonald\u2019s is adding monosodium glutamate to its sandwich. While MSG is generally safe, according to the Food and Drug Administration, its use is controversial because some people complain of side effects such as headache, numbness and heart palpitations.Tender JuicinessIn 2017, Wendy\u2019s said it was slashing its average chicken size by 20 per cent to improve its \u201ctenderness and juiciness.\u201d\u201cWe saw instant feedback from our customers, who told us our sandwiches across the entire chicken lineup were juicier and more tender,\u201d said Liliana Esposito, chief communications officer for the chain.Popeyes and Chick-fil-A declined to comment.The biggest U.S. chicken producers were mum about their supplies of little chickens.

Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said 3M is positioning itself to capitalize on an eventual rebound.The shares dropped 2.1 per cent to US$171.87 before regular trading opened in New York. 3M fell 7.4 per cent in 2019, the third-worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.As part of the newly announced restructuring, non-U.S. employees will now report to their business groups rather than the international operations organization, which is being eliminated. Julie Bushman, who oversees international operations, will step down April 1, 3M said.The job cuts prompted a pretax charge of US$134 million in the fourth quarter, the company said. Total adjusted profit fell to US$1.95 a share in the period, trailing the US$2.10 average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 2.1 per cent to US$8.1 billion.The transportation and electronics unit continued to weigh on results, with revenue dropping 6.2 per cent. The strain was countered somewhat by the health-care division, a recent bright spot, which boosted sales 25 per cent in the quarter.Roman acknowledged that 3M \u201ccontinued to manage challenges in certain key end markets,\u201d but said in the statement that the results were still in line with the company\u2019s expectations.China VirusInvestors will look to 3M, which has a broad footprint around the world, for comments on the impact of the deadly coronavirus that has killed more than 100 people in China and is spreading around the globe. Many companies have restricted employee travel and taken other steps in response. 3M has a particularly direct relationship to the crisis as a top maker of protective face masks.The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company took a pretax fourth-quarter writedown of US$214 million for litigation related to PFAS chemicals. The company, along with chemicals- and materials-making peers such as Chemours Co., faces potentially substantial liability from lawsuits over the harmful effects of the so-called \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d3M gave the first peek at its expectations for 2020, saying adjusted profit will be US$9.30 to US$9.75 a share this year. The midpoint of the range trailed the US$9.60 average of analyst estimates. Organic sales, excluding the impact of currency conversions, will rise no more than 2 per cent this year.\u00a0Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Thomas Seal and Alex Morales", "title": "U.K. gives Huawei limited role in 5G network, defying President Trump", "description": "Huawei licence risks clash with America just when U.K. needs crucial U.S. trade deal the most", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/u-k-gives-huawei-partial-role-in-5g-network-breaking-with-u-s", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/boris-johnson-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 28, 2020 7:48 AM EST", "content": "Britain will let Huawei Technologies Co. play a limited role in building the country\u2019s next-generation mobile phone networks, denying a long-running attempt by the U.S. to have the Chinese tech giant barred.In a statement released midday in London, the U.K. said it will keep high risk vendors, alluding to Huawei, out of the most sensitive core parts of the networks but will allow the company to supply other gear that\u2019s critical to the roll-out of 5G, such as antennas and base stations.The country will also impose a cap of up to 35 per cent on the Shenzhen-based vendor\u2019s radio access components, so phone carriers like BT Group Plc\u2019s EE and Vodafone Group Plc may face a challenge reducing their dependence on Huawei. \nReaction to UK allowing Huawei a role in 5G network\nJohnson\u2019s choice: Britain faces policy test over Huawei 5G role\nHigh risk vendors, a category which could also include China\u2019s ZTE, which is already banned from the U.K., are also to be \u201cexcluded from sensitive geographic locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases.\u201dThe recommended 35 per cent cap will be kept under review and could reduce over time, the statement said. BT is already set to switch out Huawei core network components inherited when it bought the EE mobile network in 2016.In a statement, Huawei Vice-President Victor Zhang said it was \u201creassured\u201d that the U.K. government will let the company keep working with carriers on 5G. \u201cThis evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future,\u201d he said, committing to build on Huawei\u2019s more than 15 years supplying U.K. telecom operators.The widely-expected announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government is a compromise between the outright ban on Huawei sought by the U.S. and the access sought by telecommunication companies. While it ends months of political wrangling, it remains fraught with peril for Johnson as he prepares to end 47 years of European Union membership for the U.K.The Confederation of British Industry, the leading business lobby in the country, said \u201cthis solution appears a sensible compromise that gives the UK access to cutting-edge technology, whilst building in appropriate checks and balances around security.\u201dA key pillar of Johnson\u2019s vision for a future outside the world\u2019s richest single market is a trade deal with the U.S. and the Huawei licence risks setting up a clash with President Donald Trump.By curbing Huawei\u2019s access but still allowing the supplier to play a role in 5G, British officials are betting they can manage any security risks at home and still maintain intelligence-sharing ties with the U.S. and other allies.Johnson discussed Huawei in a phone call with Trump on Friday, though his remarks on Monday suggested he wasn\u2019t swayed by the push for a total ban. The prime minister said the U.K. could have the best of both worlds: retaining access to the best technology while protecting the data of consumers. British security services deem the risks manageable.For the U.K. timing of its announcement is particularly sensitive.

Today, it\u2019s trading under US$10 a pound following a quadrupling of supply from 2018 to 2019.Meanwhile, the CBD consumer market remains limited as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to prohibit the extract in food or dietary supplements, although many sellers ignore that mandate.

There\u2019s so much competition.\u201dLerner, a former Cargill trader, founded PanXchange in 2011. It started as a trading platform and benchmark pricing service for commodities in East Africa, then expanded into the U.S. via the specialty sand market for oil and gas. PanXchange launched the hemp industry\u2019s first suite of benchmark prices in January 2019, one month after the U.S. farm bill legalized the plant, and added a trading platform in August.Today, the hemp market is \u201crife with desperate sellers and opportunist buyers,\u201d Lerner said in her December analysis of the industry. She looked at three different measures of potential CBD demand and found in each case that farmers are growing far more hemp than the industry needs.Every way you slice it, the physical demand for the CBD market is much, much smaller than the supplyJulie Lerner \n \nFor example, Lerner estimated that Charlotte\u2019s Web Holdings Inc., the largest publicly traded CBD company, needed less than 500 acres of hemp to service an estimated US$95 million of sales in 2019. Assuming Charlotte\u2019s Web accounts for approximately 2.4 per cent of the US$4 billion U.S. CBD market, that means about 20,000 acres of hemp are needed in total.Instead, Lerner estimated that approximately 115,000 acres were harvested in 2019. And it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201cWe are hearing that despite the losses people have had this year, they\u2019re still going to increase plantings, and you have Texas, Florida, Wyoming and a bunch of late-comers that are just starting this crop year,\u201d she said.Lerner predicted that industrial demand for hemp will eventually dwarf the CBD market, but that won\u2019t happen until prices drop even more.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit chicken and egg,\u201d she said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be demand for it until prices drop, and people won\u2019t be planting for the industrial fibre market until there\u2019s huge demand for it, so we\u2019ve got to get over that hump first.\u201dCannabis PricesMeanwhile, U.S. prices for cannabis also fell in most states and categories in 2019 \u2014 the opposite of the trend seen north of the border.An analysis by wholesale cannabis marketplace LeafLink found that statewide pricing across categories fell in every legal state except Washington and Oregon. Prices also dropped in all categories except for edibles and ingestibles.Notably, prices for smokable flower dropped 8 per cent nationwide, with California prices falling 21 per cent and Oregon tumbling 24 per cent. \u201cThis is likely due to the proliferation of non-flower related products as these two markets reach maturity,\u201d LeafLink said in its report.Despite the price increases in 2019, Washington remained the cheapest state to buy cannabis due to \u201cproduct over-saturation,\u201d LeafLink said.

In 2009, the company spun out its oilsands assets into Cenovus Energy Inc. in a bid to unlock shareholder value and focus on natural gas.

The company, which has more than 1,000 Burger King locations, said sales appear to be stabilizing at that level.

By comparison, U.S. Treasuries maturing in 20 years would yield 2.10 per cent, or 55 basis points above the Fed effective rate.Exploring new maturities could make sense at a time when Canada anticipates greater-than-expected deficits. Finance Minister Bill Morneau released estimates last month that showed a budget shortfall for the five-year period between 2019 and 2023 exceeding prior forecasts by about $35 billion.\u201cLocking in lower rates for longer terms gives Canadians greater confidence that a return to higher rates will not impact our standard of life as much,\u201d said Malcolm. \u201cAlso, if the government is going to fund long-term infrastructure projects to spur growth, it makes sense to match the term of the funding with the life of the asset.\u201dHowever, not everyone says Canada should introduce a new maturity. Instead, the country should increase the frequency of its 10- and 30-year bond offerings, Mark Chandler, head of fixed-income research at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview.A press officer at the Department of Finance in Ottawa said Canada doesn\u2019t have plans to issue a 20-year bond at the moment.

That reflects an economy running nicely at around its capacity \u2014 neither too hot nor too cold. \nStephen Poloz\u2019s dashboard: Data warnings still flashing as Bank of Canada decides on rates\nRemember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nOil remains a pillar of Canada's economy, but it's the digital economy that's driving growth\nOf course, what matters more for policy makers is where inflation is headed rather than where it\u2019s been, and the central bank will update its outlook with new quarterly forecasts on Wednesday. They will probably revise down fourth quarter growth estimates, from their October projection of 1.3 per cent. Growth is trending at less than 1 per cent for the final three months of last year, according to the latest Bloomberg survey of economists.But the net effect of the changes isn\u2019t clear. For all of 2019, growth may be higher than the bank previously forecast because upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada means the economy probably had less slack to begin with.A weak fourth quarter also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the central bank will cut its growth forecasts for 2020, given the stabilizing outlook for the global economy and some positive developments on the trade front.Home PricesOfficials sometimes downplay the extent to which household debt and financial stability factor into rate setting, but the recent housing rebound and acceleration in borrowing will only amplify their concern.Poloz highlighted the possibility earlier this month that speculative activity is returning in some major real estate markets. That\u2019s one more reason not to cut.Core MandateTo be sure, Poloz won\u2019t hesitate to lower rates if there\u2019s a discernible worsening in the outlook. The central bank\u2019s primary inflation-targeting objective is aimed at ensuring the economy grows at a sustainable pace over the medium term. Financial stability is a secondary concern.So if the data continue to disappoint, a rate cut may be in the offing. While investors are sanguine about a move, nine of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg are anticipating at least one rate cut by June.Nor, if history is any guide, will Poloz\u2019s imminent departure hinder him from acting. David Dodge cut rates in his final decision as governor in January 2008. So did Gordon Thiessen in 2001.That said, as long as the economy remains in a relatively good place and household debt levels continue to pick up, Poloz may be content to simply stand pat before he stands down.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Aaron Kirchfeld, Myriam Balezou, Nabila Ahmed and Eyk Henning", "title": "Bombardier in talks to combine\u00a0rail unit with competitor Alstom", "description": "A rail deal is among several options Bombardier is exploring to stabilize its portfolio, which also includes business jets, sources said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/rail/bombardier-in-talks-to-combine-rail-unit-with-competitor-alstom", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bombardier-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 21, 2020 3:35 PM EST", "content": "Bombardier Inc., the embattled Canadian train and plane maker, is exploring a combination of its rail business with French rival Alstom SA, according to people familiar with the matter.The two companies have held preliminary talks about a rail deal in the past few months, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Representatives for Alstom and Bombardier declined to comment.Bombardier rose as much as 4.9 per cent in trading in Toronto Tuesday.

A rail deal is among several options the Canadian company is exploring to stabilize its portfolio, which also includes business jets, they said.The deliberations started before Bombardier shocked the market last week by warning of disappointing fourth-quarter sales, according to the people. Bombardier also said at the time that it may exit a joint venture with Airbus SE that makes the A220 jetliner and potentially take a major writedown. Bombardier shares dropped as much as 39 per cent on the news, a record decline.China CompetitionA takeover of Bombardier\u2019s rail business by Alstom would mark the latest attempt by some of the world\u2019s biggest trainmakers to counter growing competition from China. Bombardier in 2017 held talks to combine its rail operations with competitor Siemens AG until the German company suddenly opted to pursue a deal with Alstom.The European Union then in February 2019 blocked the Franco-German merger, which would have created a European rail champion, after regulators refused to cave in to warnings about the looming threat of Chinese competition.While historically best known as a manufacturer of metro, commuter and regional trains, Bombardier has collaborated in high-speed projects including Alstom\u2019s high-speed TGV.US$6 Billion InvestmentThe potential end of Bombardier\u2019s involvement in A220 manufacturing, combined with new stumbles in the company\u2019s rail business, have undermined a once-great name in manufacturing \u2014 just when investors thought they were poised to reap the rewards of a difficult turnaround effort. Walking away from the A220 would close the book on Bombardier\u2019s work on an aircraft program in which the company invested more than US$6 billion.The negative earnings announcement could hamper efforts to reach a deal with Alstom, weighing on the estimated value of the Canadian company\u2019s rail operations or spurring both firms to focus on their own separate businesses, the people said.Bombardier in 2015 sold a 30 per cent stake in its Berlin-based train business to pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, valuing the unit at US$5 billion at the time and helping the firm raise capital as it faced a cash drain from delays for its new jets. Before that, it had considered an IPO of the rail unit.Learjet, ChallengerWere Bombardier to exit both rail and the A220 project, control of which it ceded to Airbus in 2018, its operations would be confined to manufacturing corporate aircraft under the Learjet, Challenger and Global brands.The company sold its turboprop business to Longview Aviation Capital Corp. for US$300 million in a deal completed last year, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. agreed to buy the CRJ regional jet arm for US$550 million in June.\u2013With assistance from Scott Deveau, Geraldine Amiel, Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster and Siddharth Philip.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Esha Dey", "title": "Tesla shares could hit $960 in early 2021, company's biggest bull says", "description": "Tesla shares have increased more than 100 per cent over the past three months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/tesla-shares-could-hit-960-in-early-2021-companys-biggest-bull-says", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tesla-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 21, 2020 1:16 PM EST", "content": "Tesla Inc.\u2019s most bullish Wall Street analyst predicts the electric-car maker\u2019s dizzying rally will accelerate this year and that the stock will trade in the US$640-to-US$960 range in early 2021.New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu anticipates the company will sell 2 million to 3 million cars per year after 2025 at industry-leading margins, justifying a market capitalization of US$230 billion to US$350 billion, or about US$1,100 to US$1,700 per share.\u201cThe stock will remain volatile, as the spread between bull and bear cases remains wide,\u201d said Ferragu, who boosted his price target to a Street high. \u201cAnd God only knows what the next controversy will be.\u201d \nLarry Ellison\u2019s $1-billion Tesla bet is finally paying off after a wild ride\nTesla\u2019s riding on \u2018ludicrous mode,\u2019 fuelling more target hikes and burning shorts in dizzying stock increase\nTesla surges above $500, leaving analyst targets in the dust\nTesla is set to report quarterly earnings next week.

The stock has advanced about 6 per cent so far in 2020, double the advance of the S&P 500 Index.The company, which has more than 31,000 outlets in more than 80 markets, joins a parade of companies announcing green initiatives as the World Economic Forum in Davos gets underway with a redoubled focus on climate change. This year\u2019s gathering in the Swiss ski resort features Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, while Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink of BlackRock Inc. set the tone by warning that the asset manager will address the issue in its investments.We know this journey will be challenging, we know we can\u2019t do this alone, and we know this will require others to join usCEO Kevin Johnson \n \nThe coffee chain\u2019s moves follow investor pressure, with a resolution calling on the company to step up the use of sustainable packaging receiving support from almost half of shareholders at its annual general meeting last year.\u201cWhile Starbucks has a long road ahead to achieve these goals, we\u2019re encouraged that its priorities are rooted in transparent data and will be supplemented by first-of-its-kind market research,\u201d said Allan Pearce, shareholder advocate at Trillium Asset Management.Under founder and former CEO Howard Schultz, Starbucks focused on sustainability by purchasing renewable energy, investing in climate-resistant coffee trees and giving discounts to customers who brought their own tumblers. Johnson, who took the helm in 2017, sold US$1 billion of bonds to help fund the green and ethical sourcing initiatives. The company has named its first chief sustainability officer, Michael Kobori, who is joining from Levi Strauss & Co.\u2018Resource Positive\u2019At an unspecified point beyond 2030, Johnson said, the company aims to become \u201cresource positive\u201d by storing more carbon than it emits, eliminating waste and providing more fresh water than it uses.The moves come as governments around the world step up action on the environment with measures such as a pending European Union ban on some single-use plastics.Other chains are acting too. McDonald\u2019s Corp. has said it aims to cut restaurant and office emissions by 36 per cent from 2015 levels through 2030. KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands Inc. is seeking a 10% average reduction per store by the end of 2025.Alternative milks will be a big part of the solutionCEO Kevin Johnson \n \nThe fast-food chains start from a higher base. Each outlet was responsible for more than four times the level of carbon dioxide emissions as Starbucks stores in 2017, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Cooking and selling a broader range of menu items, including carbon-intensive meat, makes cutting emissions tougher.Starbucks has switched to wind power in some of its cafes, but meeting its carbon-reduction goals will require bigger changes. Johnson said he\u2019ll push consumers to choose milk made from almond, coconuts, soy or oats, whose production is environmentally friendlier than dairy. In North America, 15 per cent to 20 per cent of Starbucks customers already choose such options.Alternative Milk\u201cAlternative milks will be a big part of the solution,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe consumer-demand curve is already shifting.\u201dThe Seattle-based company is testing new drinks made with plant-based ingredients and seeking ways to make whipped cream without emitting nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas. Starbucks also aims to lower the cost of dairy alternatives by helping suppliers boost output, he said.Tackling another form of pollution \u2014 the food and drink containers that litter city streets, clog landfills and often end up in the world\u2019s oceans \u2014 has been equally challenging. Starbucks says it\u2019s responsible for about 1 per cent of the estimated 600 billion disposable cups used globally every year.\n\nStarbucks is looking for ways to make whipped cream without emitting nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas.\n\nTyler Anderson/National Post files\n\nAround March of this year, the company plans to begin testing a paper cup it\u2019s been developing with partners seeking a more widely recyclable and compostable hot-drink container. Existing ones generally contain a plastic layer that makes them difficult to process. Costa Coffee, a U.K.-based chain owned by Coca-Cola Co., two years ago announced plans to pay waste collectors a supplement to handle them, boosting its recycling efforts.Starbucks previously reined back a goal set in 2008, which was to serve 25 per cent of coffee in personal travel mugs. Only about 5 per cent of U.K. customers use reusable containers even though the company offers a 25-pence (33-cent) discount for them, while charging a 5-pence fee for paper cups.Lost SalesA smaller U.K. chain, Boston Tea Party Cafes, has eliminated single-use cups entirely, but that cost it 25 per cent of takeaway coffee sales in the first year after the initiative went into effect.Johnson said he\u2019s counting on Generation Z to lead adoption of environmentally friendlier practices, saying this will make it financially rewarding for companies to respond. Starbucks will stick to its long-term target of double-digit growth in earnings per share despite the cost of its green goals, he said.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a linear journey,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have positive steps and then we\u2019ll try something else that works.

Fear and doubt is not a good thought process, because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.\u201dThe World Economic Forum audience included 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who brought a stark message to the business elite gathering in Davos: Everybody is talking about climate change, but nobody is doing anything. Trump has mocked Thunberg on Twitter.\n\nGreta Thunberg, climate activist, attends the special address by U.S. President Donald Trump, at Davos on Tuesday. Thunberg was in the audience throughout Trump\u2019s speech. As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down.\n\nJason Alden/Bloomberg\n\nThe forum is sounding alarm bells on climate change. This year and for the first time on record, environmental risks occupy the group\u2019s top five long-term concerns, while corporate executives say they\u2019re increasingly concerned about environmental issues.Trump\u2019s remarks were largely focused on America\u2019s economy as an example to other nations, which he urged to cut regulations and taxes. Trump sought to take credit for a booming economy, repeating his re-election arguments just hours before the U.S. Senate was set to formally start his impeachment trial. \nRemember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nIMF trims global economic outlook but softens risk warnings\nWorld's richest 2,000 people hold more than poorest 4.6 billion combined, says Oxfam report\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve regained our stride, rediscovered our spirit.\u201dTrump recounted how his administration presided over cuts in regulations and taxes, and described low unemployment rates for African Americans and women.Claiming CreditTrump claims credit for overseeing an economy enjoying its longest-ever expansion, with an unemployment rate that fell to a five-decade low after tax cuts and spending increases. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which Trump regularly cites as a marker of success, is up about 25 per cent from a year ago.But his fight with China over trade and other protectionist policies have created uncertainty among businesses, especially manufacturers. Despite last week\u2019s interim trade deal with Beijing, the International Monetary Fund on Monday predicted economic growth will moderate to 2 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 2021 from 2.3 per cent in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes.America\u2019s thriving, America is flourishing and, yes, America is winning again like never beforeDonald Trump \n \nIn his speech at the Swiss resort, Trump said: \u201cThe American dream is back, bigger better and stronger than ever before.\u201dThe president repeated his grievances with the Fed, saying it raised rates too quickly and lowered them too slowly.Trump said in his speech that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201clove each other\u201d even after their fight over trade.\u201cHe\u2019s for China and I\u2019m for the U.S., but other than that, we love each other,\u201d Trump said.Meeting LeadersTrump is due to hold bilateral meetings with Iraqi President Barham Salih, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga and Nechirvan Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, according to the White House. Trump will also meet with the forum\u2019s executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, and has said he\u2019ll meet with business leaders, too. He leaves Davos on Wednesday.This is Trump\u2019s second visit as president to the annual gathering of business chiefs, central bankers and foreign leaders. Hanging over the trip this time, however, is his impeachment trial set to formally begin in the Senate. Trump will almost certainly be acquitted by the Republican majority in the Senate, but the trial may produce surprises.Trump has sought to highlight his trade and economic victories to contrast the impeachment proceedings. He skipped Davos in 2017 out of concern that the well-heeled Davos crowd was the wrong fit for a man elected on a nationalist, anti-elites message. He attended in 2018, then skipped last year amid a government shutdown.Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the biggest-name political leaders in attendance; Trump has regularly complained that Merkel spends too little on defence, doesn\u2019t do enough in Ukraine and is too soft on Iran\u2019s regime, but won\u2019t meet with her in Davos.Other speakers include teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Trump has insulted on Twitter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose phone call with Trump triggered the impeachment process, is also due to attend briefly but not to meet with the U.S. president.Once Trump leaves on Wednesday, the U.S. delegation will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Trump\u2019s first Davos appearance in 2018 oscillated between a vintage, raucous version of Trump in meetings with national leaders and business executives and more subdued remarks in his formal speech.

Liquidity is your best friend on Monday and your worst coward on FridayDavid Rosenberg \n \nThe roaring stock market is essentially a \u201cbull market in financial engineering,\u201d stoked by the Fed Reserve\u2019s purchases of Treasury bills starting in October, interest rate cuts, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul (which handed America\u2019s top banks a US$32 billion windfall) and corporate share buybacks.\u201cLast year, was like, just throw a dart,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s indiscriminate buying. Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be like that. Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be easy.\u201dThe Debate Over Whether to Call It QE Is Over, and the Fed LostWhile economists only see a 30 per cent chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, Rosenberg said a retreat in spending on restaurants, movies and furnishings and other discretionary spending are harbingers of a slowdown, along with a deceleration in U.S. core inflation.\u201cWhen you stop hearing \u2018where are we going for dinner tonight?\u2019 and instead you start hearing \u2018who\u2019s cooking dinner?\u2019 then you know that a new form of frugality is taking place.\u201dHere\u2019s how he\u2019s battening down the hatches in his model portfolio:Gold\u201cGold is a place you want to be. I think that it\u2019s partly because its inversely correlated with interest rates.

Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor. The country has also pushed companies to distribute dividends, introduce and/or expand share buybacks and have allowed for foreigners on corporate boards as shareholder activism picks up. \u201cThis is revolutionary in Japan.\u201dBonds in DragBond-proxies in the stock market, or what Rosenberg calls \u201cbonds in drag\u201d are also good investments as the economy heads into a downturn. Utilities, REITs and pipelines, which he calls asset-backed cash flow generators, are worth holding.\u201cIt\u2019s really more about putting together a portfolio of stocks \u2014 non-cyclical, liquid, strong balance sheets, with not much of a refinancing calendar that have been able to increase their dividends,\u201d he said.\u201cDownright cheap\u201d energy stocks are also favoured by Rosenberg. \u201cEnergy stocks are not priced for WTI where we are right now. They are priced for something that\u2019s gotta be at least 20 per cent \u2013 30 per cent lower.\u201dDefence stocks are a cheaper way to boost exposure to tech as countries beef up military spending. \u201cDefence is actually a technology.

Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nWorld's richest 2,000 people hold more than poorest 4.6 billion combined, says Oxfam report\nU.S., China trade deal bodes ill for Canada\u2019s farmers\nFor the IMF, which sees growth accelerating to 3.4 per cent in 2021, the positives include signs that the slump in manufacturing and global trade is bottoming out, \u201cintermittent\u201d good news on U.S.-China trade talks and accommodative monetary policy.The Fund even quantified the impact of central bank\u2019s efforts to shore up growth last year. It said growth in 2019 and 2020 would be 0.5 percentage point weaker without their stimulus push.\u201cGlobally the big story is this extraordinary pivot by central banks in 2019,\u201d BlackRock Vice Chairman Philip Hildebrand said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWhat\u2019s been holding this back or offsetting this is the trade risks, the geopolitical risks, so if we can pull back on those, we should see global growth edging up.\u201dThe IMF made modest downgrades to 2020 projections for the U.S. and the euro area, while India\u2019s forecast was slashed by more than a percentage point. The prediction for global trade volume growth was cut to 2.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent, though that would still be far better than last year\u2019s 1 per cent.While risks have eased, the IMF was clear that that there\u2019s still plenty to worry about. Progress in trade talks is stop-start, simmering U.S.-Iran tensions could hit oil supply, and there\u2019s also social unrest and weather-related disasters.\u201cFew signs of turning points are yet visible in global macroeconomic data,\u201d it said. \u201cThe risk of protracted subpar global growth remains tangible despite tentative signs of stabilizing momentum.\u201dThe U.S.-China trade pact, signed Jan. 15, reduces the cumulative negative effect of the battle on output over 2019 and 2020 to 0.5 per cent, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said. The previous estimate was 0.8 per cent, or $700 billion, with tariffs accounting for a third and the rest from companies not investing, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in Washington Friday.\u201cA trade truce is not the same as trade peace,\u201d Georgieva said. Completion of the first phase of the deal mean a \u201cshrinkage of the negative impact, but not an eradication.\u201dOther ForecastsThe fund held or reduced its estimates for most of the world\u2019s biggest economies for 2020, with Japan a notable exception. It raised the outlook to 0.7 per cent from 0.5 per cent, reflecting the anticipated boost from stimulus measures undertaken in December. The fund raised China\u2019s estimate by 0.2 percentage point to 6 per cent. The phase one trade deal is likely to alleviate near-term cyclical weakness, though unresolved disputes on broader U.S.-China economic relations \u201cwill continue weighing on activity.\u201d The 2020 estimate for the U.S. was lowered by 0.1 percentage point to 2 per cent, and 2021 held at 1.7 per cent. India\u2019s downgrade was because domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in the non-bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth, the fund said.

Ian Bremmer, a delegate at the World Economy Forum\u2019s annual meeting and founder of Eurasia Group, describes this year as a \u201ctipping point.\u201dThe theme is captured throughout the Davos program, which contains multiple panels on \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d and tackling inequality. Participants will also discuss the future of globalization and whether central banks are out of ammunition. \nInterest rates have been a tailwind for investors for 40 years. Will this be the decade that changes?\n'Major mindset change': What\u2019s in store for Canada\u2019s energy sector in 2020 \u2013 podcast\nBeware the pitfalls and perils of the gig economy\nHere are the hot talking points:Peak Globalization?The era of people, goods and money flowing increasingly unchecked around the world may have past its high point as governments pursue protectionism and erect more obstacles to migration. Already there are around 77 physical barriers delineating international borders compared with 15 in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, according to Bank of America. The World Trade Organization calculates the pace of growth in international commerce fell below the rate of economic expansion in 2019 for the fifth time since the financial crisis. Foreign direct investment inflows have been on the decline since 2015, says the United Nations.The U.S.-China trade war is at the center of the shift. But even with the signing of an interim deal, the Peterson Institute for International Economics reckons the average U.S. tariff on imports from China is still 19.3 per cent versus 3.1 per cent at the start of 2018. Away from Beijing, Trump is also seeking to remodel the World Trade Organization and potentially clamp down on European auto exports. The U.K. still needs to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.Still, the continued development of the digital economy, rising tourism and mounting reliance of companies on revenues generated outside their home market provide room for confidence globalization is evolving rather than ending.Peak Capitalism?JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc. Founder Laurence Fink, both of whom will be in Davos, are among those who have entered the debate over whether companies should better weigh stakeholders such as customers and employees, a departure from the decades-old shareholder-first mindset.Behind the shift: the rise of populism, concern wages aren\u2019t keeping up with assets such as equities and fears over climate change.The maturing millennial generation are a driving force too. When making investment decisions, 87 per cent of those born between 1981 and 1996 believe environmental, social and governance factors are important, according to Bank of America.Peak Inequality?The pressure to reduce inequality will become more urgent this decade as the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals approach their 2030 deadline. 193 governments have signed up to 17 goals, 169 targets and 304 indicators on how to end poverty, clean up the environment and share prosperity for all.There has already been some progress. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, last year\u2019s winners of the Nobel Prize for economics, estimate the average income of the world\u2019s bottom 50 per cent of earners also almost doubled since 1980.But William Gale of the Brookings Institution notes the 400 richest Americans owned 3.26 per cent of wealth in 2018, up from 0.93 per cent in 1982. The top 1 per cent also paid about a third of their income in tax in both 1979 and 2019, he says. Expect such numbers to be bandied about ahead of the U.S. election in November, with some Democrat candidates promoting higher corporate and wealth taxes.Peak Youth?For the first time, there are now more seniors than children in the world and that trend is set to escalate, according to the UN. The global fertility rate already halved from 5 children per woman in 1955 and the average life expectancy has increased from 31 in 1900 to 72 today and is tipped to reach 83 by the end of this century.While another 1 billion people are expected on the planet by 2030, the demographic mix will be starkly different. For starters, the number of those aged 65 or older will outnumber children under the age of 5.The growth of the working age population is also set to slow, straining pensions and healthcare resources. In a recent paper, Stanford University Professor Charles Jones said there is a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that global population will decline rather than stabilize in the long run, threatening economic growth.Peak Climate Change?The world faces a sweeping series of climate-related tipping points \u2014 from melting ice caps to droughts and dying coral reefs. Nature magazine in November collated the risks, which they described as a climate emergency that will compel political and economic actions on emissions. 21 of the hottest years on record came in the last quarter century.\u201cWe argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best,\u201d the article\u2019s authors wrote.The international effort to rein in fossil fuel pollution took a knock in December after marathon UN talks watered down language on issues they had agreed on in previous years.Peak oil demand?Hotter temperatures have put new scrutiny on the world\u2019s energy mix.This means renewable energy like solar and wind, plus electric vehicles are going to soar up the policy agenda at the cost of fossil fuel gurgling vehicles. Big Oil executives believe that peak oil demand is increasingly likely in the late 2030s.For example, Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and the most profitable company in the planet, said on its initial public offering prospectus that oil demand may peak around 2035, with demand \u201cleveling off.\u201dPeak Cars?The 1.3 billion vehicles on the roads today are probably the most there will ever be. Megacities will house around two thirds of the global population by mid-century, cutting back on the need for expensive cars.Evolving urban architecture will also increasingly constrain car usage. The shift is already underway in mature markets. Only 26 per cent of U.S. 16-year-olds earned a driver\u2019s licence in 2017 compared with almost half just 36 years ago, according to Sivak Applied Research. Even if overall car sales remain robust, cheaper technology such as robotaxis and developments such as ride-sharing stand to take the shine off their attractiveness.Peak Central Banks?Central banks may have rescued the world from depression in the wake of the financial crisis, but their ability to turnaround their economies from here is limited after what Bank of America estimates is more than 700 interest rate cuts and around US$12 trillion in quantitative easing since 2009.Negative interest rates are already being blamed for hurting banks, while demographic shifts, record debt levels, technological disruption and bank deleveraging all sap the potency of monetary policy. That leaves politicians under pressure to loosen fiscal policy the next time trouble hits the world economy.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Josh Wingrove", "title": "White House considering changes to law banning U.S. companies from paying bribes overseas", "description": "'It's just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas,' President Trump said in a forthcoming book", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/white-house-considering-changes-to-law-banning-u-s-companies-from-paying-bribes-overseas", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/donald-trump-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 17, 2020 3:05 PM EST", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is weighing whether to seek changes to a 1977 law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies to bribe foreign officials.\u201cWe are looking at it,\u201d White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow said at the White House on Friday, in response to a reporter\u2019s question about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\u201cI would just say: We are aware of it, we are looking at it, and we\u2019ve heard complaints from some of our companies,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything definitive policy-wise, but we are looking at it.\u201d \n\u2018Canada should be worried\u2019: Canadian exporters may become collateral damage of U.S-China trade deal\nWith a few tweets, Michael McCain shows that running a corporation isn\u2019t just about profit\nAs U.S. disables one forum for trade fights under WTO, it strengthens another under USMCA\nA forthcoming book called \u201cA Very Stable Genius: Donald J.

However, Old Navy\u2019s performance has deteriorated in recent quarters and Peck was removed as CEO late last year.\u201cThe work we\u2019ve done to prepare for the spin shone a bright light on operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement,\u201d Robert Fisher, Gap\u2019s interim CEO, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe have learned a lot and intend to operate Gap Inc. in a more rigorous and transformational manner that empowers our growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, and appropriately focuses on profitability for Banana Republic and Gap brand.\u201d \nRetail stores experiment with renting out clothes as they try to capture extra customer dollars\nMeghan Markle\u2019s favourite affordable Canadian brand is defying the trend of retail decline\nGap to close stores in Canada as part of plan to shutter half its locations over next two years\nGap shares rose 6.9 per cent at 7.22 a.m. on Friday.

In a September presentation about the spinoff, Gap said the separation would create a one-time expense of US$400 million to US$450 million, and cost US$300 million to US$350 million in terms of capital.Khaki JuggernautGap, founded in 1969 in San Francisco, rose to prominence as a denim emporium selling jeans from Levi Strauss & Co., another Bay Area institution. It helped pioneer the vertical integration of retail and started producing its own branded goods. By the 1990s, it had transformed into a fashion juggernaut as it jumped on the khaki-pants trend and built up robust secondary brands in Banana Republic and Old Navy.But struggles started brewing in the middle of the next decade, from declining mall traffic to operational issues.

Will this be the decade that changes?\nForecasting the market is almost impossible \u2014 so here\u2019s what investors should do instead\nFour reasons to be upbeat about markets you won\u2019t find in the headlines\nSo-called liquid alts \u2014 which encompass everything from hedge funds to real estate, private debt and equity and infrastructure \u2014 are taking off as investors chase higher yields outside those offered by traditional bonds. Investments have reached about US$882 billion, including about $47 billion in exchange traded funds, according to Greenwich Associates.A year ago, regulators cleared the way for the mutual funds in Canada. A total of 37 funds from 15 companies had been launched by July, with assets reaching $3.4 billion, according to a report by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.Rubbish FundsUnlike typical hedge funds, investors can take money out on a daily basis. They\u2019re often more transparent and cheaper than the 20 per cent performance fee that hedge funds typically carry.Algonquin\u2019s fund has no performance fee. The first $50 million in investments will pay a 50-basis point management fee and after that the fund will charge 95 basis points.\u201cOther funds are doing a light version of a hedge fund and we\u2019re really building a much enhanced version of a normal bond fund,\u201d D\u2019Costa said. \u201cWe really want it to replace all the rubbish bond funds that are out there where people have added all kinds of other risks to to enhance yields.\u201dAlgonquin will focus on purchasing North American investment-grade corporate bonds while shorting government notes to leverage lower risk positions. Leverage will typically be about 2.25 times.5 per cent YieldThe goal is to get a 5 per cent yield, without an enormous amount of high-yield debt and staying away from emerging markets, commodities and currency risks. Bond maturities will typically be four years, which brings the interest-rate risk down, portfolio manager Alex Schwiersch said.\u201cA traditional bond fund is going to return 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent a year if you\u2019re lucky over the cycle. And you\u2019re going to have to take a lot of risks, a lot of duration, to do that,\u201d Schwiersch said. \u201cWe can offer a product that, even though it\u2019s a liquid alternative, it\u2019s going to behave more like a bond fund.\u201dUp to 6 per cent of Algonquin\u2019s new fund, which launched this week, could be held in a single asset. It expects to invest in a broad range of sectors including financials, communications, consumer products, energy, health care, industrials, infrastructure, real estate, technology and provincial bonds in Canada and the U.S. Typically around 25 per cent of the fund may be invested in non-investment grade credits.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Natalie Obiko Pearson and Gao Yuan", "title": "The odds of Huawei\u2019s CFO Meng Wanzhou avoiding U.S. extradition are just one in 100", "description": "Meng will begin extradition hearings in a Vancouver court on Monday, 13 months after she was arrested on a U.S. handover request", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/technology/the-odds-of-huaweis-cfo-avoiding-u-s-extradition-are-just-one-in-100?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/meng-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2020 7:54 PM EST", "content": "Huawei Technologies Co.

While Ghosn fled Japan in a big black box for Lebanon, Meng squares up to begin extradition hearings in a Vancouver court on Monday, 13 months after she was arrested on a U.S. handover request.The hearings offer her first shot \u2014 however slim \u2014 at release as a Canadian judge considers whether the case meets the crucial test of double criminality: would her alleged crime have also been a crime in Canada? If not, she could be discharged, according to Canada\u2019s extradition rules. \nTrudeau calls on U.S. to hold off on signing trade deal with China until detained Canadians are released\nHuawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou nears first legal test of extradition as lawyers expose cracks in handling of arrest\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou\u2019s arrest awakens Canadians to the long, strong arm of China\n\u201cThere\u2019d be nothing holding her \u2014 bail restrictions, house arrest, all of that would be eliminated,\u201d said Michael Klein, a Vancouver lawyer who worked alongside Meng\u2019s lawyers in a 2004 extradition case. \u201cJust like if you\u2019re acquitted in a criminal case, the Crown may appeal, but that person\u2019s a free person.\u201dMeng, the eldest daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has become the highest profile target of a broader U.S. effort to contain China and its largest technology company, which Washington sees as a national security threat. The U.S. accuses her of fraud, saying she lied to HSBC Holdings Plc to trick it into conducting transactions in breach of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng, who turns 48 next month, is charged with bank and wire fraud, which carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison on conviction.\n\nAn ankle monitor is seen on Huawei Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou as she leaves her Vancouver home to appear in British Columbia Supreme Court in Vancouver on September 30, 2019.\n\nDon MacKinnon/AFP via Getty Images files\n\n\u201cIn most extradition cases, double criminality is an easy piece of analysis,\u201d says Brock Martland, a Vancouver-based criminal lawyer.In Meng\u2019s case, it\u2019s not, which may help nudge her into the 1 per cent of defendants in Canada who have historically beaten extradition orders to the U.S.Her defence has argued that the U.S. case is, in reality, a sanctions-violations complaint that it\u2019s sought to \u201cdress up\u201d as fraud to make it easier to extradite her. Had Meng\u2019s alleged conduct taken place in Canada, the transactions by HSBC wouldn\u2019t have violated any Canadian sanctions, they say. Canada\u2019s federal prosecutors counter the underlying offence is fraud because she lied to HSBC, causing them to miscalculate Huawei\u2019s risk as a creditor and conduct transactions it otherwise wouldn\u2019t have.Hong Kong TeahouseAnother potential sticking point is that Meng\u2019s alleged misconduct didn\u2019t take place in the U.S. or Canada \u2014 it rests heavily on a 2013 meeting at a Hong Kong teahouse between Meng and an HSBC banker.\u201cCanadian fraud laws do not have an extraterritorial reach,\u201d said Ravi Hira, a Vancouver-based lawyer and former special prosecutor. \u201cIf you commit a fraud in Hong Kong, I can\u2019t just prosecute you in Canada.\u201dWhile the double-criminality hearings are scheduled for four days, the ruling would likely come much later \u2014 possibly in months.Being trapped in the middle of a trade war has brought the luxury of time. Before her arrest, Meng travelled so frequently for the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker that she\u2019d gone through at least seven passports in a decade. These days, she passes her time oil painting and pursuing an online doctorate. Phone calls with her father have gone from once a year to every few days.\u201cIf a busy life has eaten away at my time, then hardship has in turn drawn it back out,\u201d Meng wrote in a poignant letter to her supporters last month on the one-year anniversary of her arrest. \u201cIt was never my intention to be stuck here so long.\u201dGhosn EscapeMeng would find it harder to pull a Ghosn. She\u2019s under 24-hour surveillance by at least two guards at her $13 million (US$10 million) mansion. Her whereabouts are recorded continuously by a GPS tracker on her left ankle. While she\u2019s allowed to roam a roughly 100-square-mile patch of Vancouver during the day accompanied by security, any violation \u2014 including tampering with the device or venturing anywhere near the airport \u2014 would automatically alert police. She\u2019s posted bail of $10 million, of which $3 million came from a group of guarantors, some of whom pledged their homes as collateral. Fleeing would cost them all.If the court finds her case fails the double-criminality test, Canada\u2019s attorney general would have the right to appeal within 30 days. In theory, she could be on a plane back to China well before that, says Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who\u2019s been involved in hundreds of Canadian extradition cases.\n\nA crowed of media stands in front of the home of Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on May 7, 2019 in Vancouver.\n\nJeff Vinnick/Getty Images files\n\nOf the 798 U.S. extradition requests received since 2008, Canada has only refused or discharged eight, according to the department of justice. That\u2019s a 99 per cent chance of being handed over \u2014 similar to the conviction rate in Japan. Another 40 cases were withdrawn by the U.S.Still, that\u2019s fractionally better than the odds of two Canadians detained in China, where the conviction rate currently stands at 99.9 per cent, according to Amnesty International.Canadians JailedThat\u2019s if Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor ever make it to trial. The two men were thrown in jail on spying allegations just days after Meng\u2019s arrest in December 2018. Last month, the Chinese government confirmed their cases were transferred to prosecutors, raising the possibility they might finally get access to lawyers.As of last week, that hadn\u2019t happened yet for Kovrig, according to the International Crisis Group, his employer. The former diplomat has been allowed one consular visit a month; in between, he\u2019s unreachable. Communication with his family is limited to letters exchanged in those visits, according to the group.Families of the two men aren\u2019t speaking publicly for fear of jeopardizing their cases. Some sense of the conditions they\u2019re enduring can be gleaned from past history.Spavor, a businessman who ran tours to North Korea from his base in a border town in northeastern China, has been held since May in Dandong Detention Centre, according to the Globe and Mail.It\u2019s a jail familiar to another Canadian, Kevin Garratt, who was snatched along with his wife Julia by Chinese security agents in 2014, becoming pawns in an earlier high-stakes attempt by Beijing to prevent Canada from extraditing millionaire businessman Su Bin to the U.S.Garratt spent 19 months in the forbidding compound surrounded by two-story-high cement walls. Crammed into a cell with up to 14 other inmates, he slurped meals from a communal bowl on the floor. If they were lucky, they got 30 minutes of hot water a day and could exercise in a small outdoor cage, he said in a December 2018 interview.China calls Meng\u2019s arrest politically motivated and accuses Canada of \u201carbitrary detention.\u201d It rejects any suggestion that the seizures of Kovrig and Spavor were in retaliation, saying China is also a rule-of-law country.Before her arrest, Meng wasn\u2019t happy working at Huawei and had been considering leaving, Ren has said in media interviews. But hardship has toughened her \u2014 when released, she will resume her role, he says.\u201cOver the past year, I have also learned to face up to and accept my situation,\u201d Meng said in her letter. \u201cI\u2019m no longer afraid of the rough road ahead.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Yuliya Fedorinova and Thomas Biesheuvel", "title": "The second-biggest diamond ever found will become Louis Vuitton jewelry", "description": "Canadian miner Lucara had previously said the diamond wasn't a type that yields top jewelry standard gems", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/second-biggest-diamond-ever-will-become-louis-vuitton-jewelry", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/diamonds.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 16, 2020 1:25 PM EST", "content": "The second-biggest diamond in history will be cut, polished and turned into a collection of Louis Vuitton jewelry.Lucara Diamond Corp., which found the 1,758-carat Sewelo diamond at its Botswana mine last year, said it\u2019s struck a deal with the luxury brand and Antwerp diamond manufacturer HB Company.

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement passed the House in December on a bipartisan 385-41 vote the day after the Democratic-led chamber voted to impeach Trump.The Senate vote is also moving in tandem with the impeachment process, coming just a few hours before Chief Justice John Roberts is sworn in to preside over the trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded the trade deal as a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation. \nAs U.S. disables one forum for trade fights under WTO, it strengthens another under USMCA\nNew NAFTA deal lifts cloud of uncertainty hanging over Canadian business: Poloz\n\u2018They lost\u2019: Canadian aluminum industry, opposition balk over auto provisions in new NAFTA\n\u201cA major win for our country.

A major win for those of us who are ready to move past this season of toxic political noise and get back to doing even more of the American people\u2019s business,\u201c McConnell said on the Senate floor.Political WinDemocrats, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, finally got behind the trade agreement in December after more than a year of wrangling with the Trump administration over changes to provisions regarding labor, the environment, pharmaceuticals and the overall enforcement of the deal. The changes won over Democratic senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren who criticized previous free trade deals.Some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, still opposed the deal because it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention climate change.\u201cDespite the fact that it includes very good labour provisions, I am voting against USMCA because it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet,\u201d Schumer said in a statement before the vote.A handful of free-trade conservatives like Pennsylvania GOP Senator Pat Toomey also voted against the agreement for creating new wage requirements in the auto industry, among other market interventions.McConnell initially said the Senate wouldn\u2019t act on the USMCA until it had finished with Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, but Pelosi\u2019s decision to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate created a window for the vote this week. The Senate Finance Committee and six other panels rushed to approve the deal since lawmakers returned from their holiday recess last week.Passing this revision of the North America Free Trade Agreement gives Trump a victory to tout in his election-year State of the Union address scheduled for Feb. 4. While the USMCA is projected to add just 0.35 per cent to GDP after six years, signing this agreement and the first phase of a China trade deal will relieve some economic uncertainty, helping Trump\u2019s pitch to voters based on the strength of the U.S. economy.For Democrats from narrowly divided or Republican-leaning districts, the USMCA allows them to show constituents that they\u2019re working with the president and doing more than impeaching him.

A week later, Catalyst persuaded an investment group to sweeten its offer a second time for Hudson\u2019s Bay Co., likely ending a six-month battle over the Saks Fifth Avenue owner.A closer look shows that while the HBC transaction may yield double-digit gains for Catalyst, the Gateway deal won\u2019t result in any significant windfall for its backers. Some of these investors had already been reluctant to invest fresh cash into the private equity firm, according to people familiar with the matter, including four who were sounded out starting in 2017 on plans for a potential new fund. \nHBC privatization bid faces hurdle as Catalyst says it has enough votes to block it\nCatalyst Capital\u2019s stake in HBC nears 16 per cent, new disclosure reveals\nCallidus Capital shareholder reaches deal to take company private as debt mounts\nCatalyst has owned Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd., one of Canada\u2019s biggest gaming companies with 25 properties, since 2009. After at least two looks at going public, it filed for an initial public offering in November 2018, targeting a total valuation of as much as $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion), a person familiar with the matter said at the time.That\u2019s a far cry from the sale announced this month with Leisure Acquisition Co., known as a special purpose acquisition company. It values the combined entity at $1.46 billion, with debt. Looking at it another way, Catalyst\u2019s 30 per cent equity stake in the new firm is worth about US$132 million, according to the deal metrics released this month. As recently as the third quarter of 2019, Catalyst said its 74 per cent stake was worth more than US$750 million, according to a report sent to investors.A representative for Toronto-based Catalyst said these numbers \u201care wrong and don\u2019t reflect important aspects of the transaction in terms of the structure, equity, cash, non-participating assets and the value delivered to Catalyst LPs over the last six years through refinancings and other transactions.\u201d The firm is under restrictions to comment given the marketing of the Gateway transaction.Sweeter BidOn the proposed Hudson\u2019s Bay deal, Glassman scored a major win for minority shareholders by prompting a higher bid from a group led by Chairman Richard Baker. Catalyst accumulated shares over the summer, amassing a 17.5 per cent stake to fight for a better price, while appealing to the Ontario Securities Commission for a delay in the shareholder vote.Based on the sweetened Baker offer of $11 a share, Catalyst would post a return of 8.8 per cent on the shares it bought in August. Catalyst also snapped up stock sold by the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan in June for $9.45 a piece, resulting in a potential 16 per cent gain.\n\nA Hudson\u2019s Bay store in Mississauga, Ont.\n\nPeter J. Thompson/National Post files\n\nStill, Catalyst missed much of the upside in the stock by buying the bulk of its shares after Baker\u2019s first bid in June at $9.45 each. Before that offer, the stock traded as low as $6.22 on June 7.The Catalyst representative said that \u201cshould the transaction be completed, the return will be materially higher than what Bloomberg\u2019s calculation attempts to show.\u201d He said the calculation is missing several key data points.Tough YearThe potential deals follow a tough year for Catalyst, which specializes in buying the debt of troubled companies \u2014 a world Glassman once described as a \u201cblood sport.\u201d His publicly traded debt unit \u2014 Callidus Capital Corp. \u2014 was taken private for just 75 cents a share in October after mounting losses from bad loans pushed it to the brink of insolvency. Catalyst, which owns 70 per cent of Callidus, took the lender public in 2014 at $14 a share.\u201cIt\u2019s clear it is a sad story and nobody is trying to put a different spin on it,\u201d David Sutin, chair of the special committee of Callidus\u2019s board, said after shareholders approved the bid from U.K. billionaire Joe Lewis to buy out minority shareholders for about $5 million.In numerous court filings over the years, Catalyst has blamed Callidus\u2019s woes on a systematic attack by dozens of Bay Street short-sellers, dubbing them the \u201cWolfpack conspirators.\u201d Callidus said in a recent regulatory filing that the shorts sought to \u201cmaterially impair\u201d its business, which hurt its ability to originate new loans and raise financing.Some Catalyst investors have since grown cautious, worried that the troubles at Callidus Capital could spill over to the private equity firm, according to people familiar with the situation. They showed little appetite to put more money into a potential new fund \u2014 what would have been the firm\u2019s sixth \u2014 that Glassman had planned to raise in 2017, according to several people familiar with the plan, including those who were sounded out on the fund. Plans for the so-called Fund VI were referenced in a report for a fund annual meeting on April 4, 2017. The fund was never put in place, and no papers were filed.The Catalyst representative said the firm never attempted to raise money for a new fund, calling it \u201ccompletely false.\u201d The terms of its previous fund, Fund V, restricted it from initiating fundraising.\u201cThis is an attempt to express a failure in something that has never occurred,\u201d the official said.Investors in the earlier Fund III are now being asked to wait another year to get their money back, giving Catalyst more time to sell assets including Advantage Rent A Car, according to a fund update sent to backers last month. The US$1-billion fund is now targeting the end of 2020 for a return of money, rather than the end of 2019, according to the update. The fund was started in 2009.

Tehran vows retribution and oil prices jump almost 5 per cent as traders rush to cover the risk of a Middle East war. Then the selling starts.It\u2019s a trading pattern that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, but has become increasingly familiar.\u00a0The threat of conflict\u00a0loomed over the heart of the global oil market this past week, but the usual panic buying by traders and consumers was met quickly by a wave of\u00a0U.S. shale drillers\u00a0grasping\u00a0the\u00a0opportunity to lock in prices for future production.The sudden price spike was\u00a0blunted, and when the dust settled\u00a0the plunge back down was\u00a0steep.These trades, known as hedges, combined with a massive expansion of oil stockpiles in Asia and surging U.S. crude exports, are the recipe for a market that\u2019s capable of quickly shrugging off disruptions that until recently were considered nightmare scenarios. \nDavid Rosenberg says energy shares are 'downright cheap' right now\nCanadian gas is fetching its best price in 10 months because of drilling cutbacks, pipeline rules change\nOil losing its geopolitical lustre as markets shrug off Iran conflict\n\u201cWhen prices spike in response to geopolitical events, producers tend to lay on more hedges,\u201d\u00a0said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. in New York. \u201cThe higher the price the more they hedge,\u201d\u00a0which makes any increase short-lived, he said.West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has slipped back below US$60 a barrel as the last of the gains from President Donald Trump\u2019s standoff with Iran faded. That didn\u2019t just reflect the easing tensions after Tehran\u2019s retaliation for the killing of General Qassem Soleimani inflicted no U.S. casualties. It was a manifestation of how the shale revolution has changed the psychology of the market.The same day that American missiles killed Iran\u2019s most important military leader\u00a0near Baghdad airport, the U.S. Energy Information Administration announced record net oil exports of 1.73 million barrels a day. That\u2019s a historic change for a country that a decade ago was one of the world\u2019s biggest importers, and it has transformed\u00a0the way the market responds to a crisis.The shale boom that triggered this shift has been led by a multitude of independent drillers that are less able\u00a0to absorb\u00a0the financial impact\u00a0of price swings than giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. or Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Unlike the era that was dominated by the supermajors, any oil rally today finds a natural seller as\u00a0smaller companies minimize their\u00a0risks by hedging.Crude prices are in the \u201csweet spot\u201d for many North American producers, RBC Capital Markets analysts including Michael Tran wrote in a note. Many of them had been waiting, or hoping, for a chance to lock in WTI prices for 2020 at US$60 a barrel, a level that was pierced after the Soleimani killing.Occidental Petroleum Corp., one of the largest drillers in the prolific Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico, revealed this week it had increased its production hedges for\u00a02020 from 300,000 to 350,000 barrels a day with the help of Wall Street banks.\u201cHedging activity has been robust over recent weeks,\u201d\u00a0RBC said. \u201cVolumes should only pick up as the price rally coincides with improving liquidity with the holiday season in the rear view mirror.\u201dEach burst of hedging gives a boost to U.S. oil producers, potentially\u00a0allowing them to maintain higher output at a time when analysts are expecting shale growth to taper. Later this year, some of the crude linked to these contracts may fill the network of pipelines, terminals and ports connected to U.S. Gulf Coast, further solidifying America\u2019s position as an energy-exporting powerhouse that offers a low-risk alternative to Middle Eastern oil.Trump himself highlighted this shift in his Jan. 8 White House press conference after Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Iraq, saying that America is \u201cindependent and we do not need Middle East oil.\u201dWhile the president\u2019s boast is an exaggeration, the region\u2019s dominance as an exporter has receded. Exports from the Middle East and North Africa accounted for 38 per cent of the oil moved around the world in 2018, down from 43 per cent a decade earlier, according to data from BP Plc.Though some countries have boosted production capacity, others like Iran and Libya have seen theirs slashed by sanctions and conflict. In contrast, since the middle of the last decade the U.S. has seen its own oil exports soar from effectively zero to more than 3 million barrels a day \u2014 more than is shipped by any Middle East producer besides Iraq and Saudi Arabia.A significant proportion of that crude is reaching Asia, the region that\u2019s historically been most dependent on energy supplies from the Persian Gulf. Those alternative supplies, combined with a significant\u00a0expansion in\u00a0oil stockpiles, mean the region\u00a0is better placed to withstand disruption.China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, has built a massive government-owned stockpile that can protect it from short-term supply shocks. Its petroleum reserves have grown from about 191 million barrels in the middle of 2015 to about 800 million in September, according to Bloomberg calculations based on government statements.\u00a0Saudi Arabia has also built up stockpiles in the past decade, including capacity for more than 8 million barrels on\u00a0Japan\u2019s Okinawa island.\u201cEmerging-market crude inventories are much higher than they have been historically, especially in Saudi and China,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including\u00a0Jeffrey Currie\u00a0said in a Jan. 6 note. \u201cBoth countries are already demonstrating their willingness to use these to stabilize supply and prices.\u201dThe muted reaction to the Soleimani crisis was the second time in just a few months that the market shrugged off serious turmoil in the Middle East. The strike on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil-processing facility in September \u2014 which the U.S. blamed on Iran \u2014 was the single biggest supply disruption in history, but the ensuing price surge fizzled out just two weeks later as the facility was repaired.To be sure, both the attack on the kingdom and the assassination of Soleimani weren\u2019t long-lasting crises, and fall back in prices also reflected the diminishing risk to supplies. But they were still major events compared with the kind of rumours that could send crude soaring a decade ago, such as the report of an Israeli training exercise that helped propel crude to almost US$150 a barrel in the summer of 2008.Industry veterans\u00a0who cut their teeth on supply disruptions, such as\u00a0the 2003 invasion of Iraq or the Gulf War of 1990 to 1991, are gradually being replaced by a younger generation whose careers\u00a0developed in a world more accustomed to surplus than shortage.\u201cThe world is still coming to terms with this new resiliency that the U.S. producers can provide,\u201d Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources\u00a0Francis Fannon said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Abu Dhabi. America is making a valuable contribution to global energy security, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Stock bulls keep calm in Canada, look past flare-up in Iran tensions", "description": "Canada's stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November last week, after reaching a fresh record Thursday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-bulls-keep-calm-in-canada-shaking-off-iranian-tensions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 8:56 PM EST", "content": "If you\u2019ve only just come back from your holiday break and looked at equity markets, you\u2019d think nothing bad happened last week.Canada\u2019s stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November after reaching a fresh record Thursday, while the S&P 500 rose almost 1 per cent.

Canada Goose needs to bring them back to more normal levels soon \u201cto reassure investors that its brand remains hot and suited to a luxury model of limited supply,\u201d Boucher said.The company declined to comment for the story.This is being closely watched by the markets, as evidenced by analysts\u2019 disagreement last month on whether discounts were deepening on Canada Goose parkas. Markdowns are rare for luxury companies that rely on scarcity and cachet to get shoppers to pay full price.\u2018Completely Different\u2019Canada Goose stock trades at about 25 times estimated annual profit per share. That\u2019s similar to Moncler SpA, a competing high-end ski jacket maker with higher price tags that\u2019s based in Milan. Critics say that valuation is too high.\u201cPeople seem to think that it\u2019s Moncler 2.0,\u201d said Brian McGough, a managing director at research firm Hedgeye who\u2019s recommended shorting the stock since May. \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s a completely different business model in every way, shape, and form.\u201dMcGough said brands like Moncler keep demand high by limiting the supply of merchandise. Canada Goose, in contrast, produces as much as it can and assumes the market will absorb it, which increases the chance that goods will ultimately need to get discounted, he said.A slew of new products, such as US$500 hoodies, elevates that risk, according to McGough, who sees outdoor-gear maker Columbia Sportswear Co. as a better-suited comparison for valuation. Columbia trades at about 21 times earnings.Canada Goose U.S.-listed shares have a total of about 15.6 million with short positions \u2014 more than triple the levels at the start of 2019, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC. That\u2019s more than a quarter of the company\u2019s float, and all together represents about US$545 million of its market capitalization, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3\u2019s head of predictive analytics.Healthy SalesDespite the rise in investors betting against the shares, Canada Goose\u2019s business remains healthy. The company expects growth of at least 25 per cent for profit and at least 20 per cent for revenue this fiscal year \u2014 an enviable pace in the struggling retail sector. Ten analysts recommend buying the stock, against four hold ratings and one sell.The six-decade-old company with the North Pole crest logo is relying less on wholesalers by selling directly to consumers. Despite protests in Hong Kong, sales in China almost doubled last quarter.\u201cBrand integrity remains intact in our view,\u201d Evercore ISI analysts led by Omar Saad wrote in a note to clients last month, after finding no signs of meaningful discounting on the ground.Mixed MessagesIncreased scrutiny over Canada Goose\u2019s use of coyote-fur trim, and ongoing protests against it, has also weighed on the stock. But part of last year\u2019s drop seems to be a self-inflicted wound that\u2019s related to executives failing to communicate clearly.Canada Goose\u2019s earnings projections, for example, have repeatedly proved to be conservative in the past, leading investors to expect markedly higher numbers. So last May, when fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts\u2019 average estimate for the first time since the company went public in 2017, the stock tumbled 31 per cent.Then in November, shares reversed gains and fell when the company said that wholesale revenue would decline by a percentage \u201cin the mid-teens\u201d in the third quarter \u2014 traditionally the most important period. The company said the drop could be attributed to some orders being fulfilled earlier in the season. At the same time, a 61 per cent jump in inventories exacerbated investors\u2019 concerns.\u201cDemand remains exceptional, but communication leaves our feathers ruffled,\u201d Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note to investors at the time. \u201cWhile management excels as operators, poor communication with the Street is weighing on the stock,\u201d he said.Canada Goose\u2019s Reiss sought to dispel concerns on the November call by noting that the timing of wholesale shipments varies every year and is unrelated to underlying demand. The inventory bump is related to a plan to maximize production efficiency as the company brings more of the manufacturing in-house, he added.Even so, the company\u2019s stock has fallen about 15 per cent since and short positions rose quickly in November.Analysts are hoping for clearer signs going forward.\u201cMore visibility on its financial strategy would help,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Boucher said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's economy just had its second-best year for jobs since 2007", "description": "December\u2019s report was crucial for policy makers in assessing the health of the nation\u2019s job market", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-gains-surprise-35200-jobs-in-december-unemployment-rate-falls-to-5-6?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/jobs.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 1:24 PM EST", "content": "Canadian employment rebounded in December after two straight monthly declines, capping the second-best year since the recession and supporting the Bank of Canada\u2019s view that the bottom isn\u2019t coming out of the labour market.Canada\u2019s economy created 35,200 jobs in December, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa.

The cost of his escape included US$14 million in forfeited bail money while the operation that saw him celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve in Beirut could have cost US$15 million or more.That includes US$350,000 for the private jet that spirited the former auto executive from Osaka to Istanbul and millions of dollars for his multi-country extraction that would have taken a team of as many as 25 people half a year to plan, according to a private security expert who said he wasn\u2019t involved and asked not to be identified given the nature of the operation.Such outflows have seen Ghosn\u2019s fortune shrink by 40 per cent since he was arrested more than a year ago at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport, according to estimates by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His fortune is now calculated to be about US$70 million, down from around US$120 million at the time of his first court appearance a year ago. \n\u2018I was brutally taken from my world as I knew it\u2019: Fugitive Carlos Ghosn says treated ruthlessly by Japan\nThe inside story of how Carlos Ghosn fled Japan to become the world\u2019s most famous fugitive\nInternational fugitive Carlos Ghosn has tales to tell and scores to settle \u2014 and now he can\n\u2018Mission Impossible\u2019In fiery, freewheeling form at a two-and-a-half hour press conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Ghosn, 65, repeatedly proclaimed his innocence against allegations he understated his income and raided corporate resources for personal gain, accused Japanese prosecutors, government officials and Nissan Motor Co. executives of conspiring to topple him, and insisted he would clear his name.\u201cI am used to what you call mission impossible,\u201d he said in response to questions from the assembled reporters. \u201cYou can expect me in the next weeks to take some initiatives to tell you how I\u2019m going to clear my name.\u201dThat might include a tell-all book. Ghosn plans to publish the story of his arrest, according to a report by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.His downfall has already seen him lose millions in payouts. Last year, Nissan cancelled retirement and stock-linked compensation and Renault SA said he won\u2019t benefit from a non-compete agreement he signed in 2015 and stock-based payments that were conditional on his staying at the company. Many of the charges against him centre on retirement payments, totalling more than US$140 million, which he hadn\u2019t yet received.French InvestigationsThat may be just the start. French investigations examining the possible misuse by Ghosn of Renault\u2019s money to host lavish parties and pay consulting fees are at a preliminary stage. The former auto executive was already hit with a US$1-million penalty as part of a September settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose the retirement payments.At his press conference, Ghosn claimed he had done nothing untoward in hosting an event at the Palace of Versailles. Regarding the SEC fine, Ghosn\u2019s lawyers said previously, \u201cWe are pleased to have resolved this matter in the U.S. with no findings or admission of wrongdoing.\u201dGhosn\u2019s U.S. law firm, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP, declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s wealth estimates or on the SEC settlement. Ghosn\u2019s Lebanese lawyer also declined to comment.Nissan is looking at bringing legal action against Ghosn in Lebanon, people familiar with the company\u2019s plans said, to recover money it claims he used improperly. The carmaker is trying to evict him from the pink villa in Beirut to which he still has access. Nissan purchased it for US$8.75 million, renovated it and furnished it for him, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u201cGhosn\u2019s flight will not affect Nissan\u2019s basic policy of holding him responsible for the serious misconduct uncovered by the internal investigation,\u201d the Yokohama-based automakeer said on Tuesday.Authorities may be looking to seize some of his assets. In Switzerland, where Ghosn reportedly banks with Julius Baer Group Ltd., Swiss authorities received a legal-aid request from the Tokyo District Attorney\u2019s Office a year ago, a spokeswoman for the agency that received the notice said. It examined the request before forwarding it to the Zurich prosecutor\u2019s office in March. A spokesman for the Zurich prosecutor\u2019s office declined to comment on the nature of the request or what they are doing with it.At Japan\u2019s request, Interpol issued a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn\u2019s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive.It\u2019s not clear if any of Ghosn\u2019s assets have been seized. In criminal court cases in Japan, a defendant\u2019s assets cannot be frozen or confiscated until a court verdict is reached, according to Taichi Yoshikai, a law professor at Kokushikan University. There are exceptions in civil cases, but it\u2019s unclear how this will be applied when a defendant is overseas, he said.Wealth AssumptionsThe Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which rarely makes public comments, posted an English-language statement on its website Thursday saying Ghosn had only himself to blame for his strict bail conditions. It vowed to bring him to justice in Japan. Ghosn had been \u201cpropagating both within Japan and internationally false information on Japan\u2019s legal system and its practice,\u201d Justice Minister Masako Mori said.Renault declined to comment.Bloomberg\u2019s calculation of Ghosn\u2019s net worth assumes none of his assets at the time of his arrest \u2014 which included shares in Renault and Nissan now valued at about US$60 million \u2014 have been seized or sold.Even if that is the case, the costs that come with being the world\u2019s most famous runaway will continue to be formidable. Legal bills for fugitive Malaysian financier Jho Low came to US$15 million, according to an October deal with U.S. federal prosecutors. Efforts to burnish Low\u2019s reputation cost US$1.1 million over seven months, according to the New York Times. Such expenses are likely sizeable enough to pressure even a fortune as large as that of the Ghosn family. Still, some costs may be lower than expected. The US$350,000 contract for Ghosn\u2019s Osaka to Istanbul flight was to be paid in two tranches. The charter company has so far only received the first half.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "CIBC hires former Tory cabinet minister Lisa Raitt as vice-chair for global investment banking", "description": "Raitt also served as deputy leader of the official opposition", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/cibc-hires-former-canadian-lawmaker-raitt-as-a-vice-chair-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/lisa-raitt.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 11:50 AM EST", "content": "Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce hired former Conservative Party lawmaker Lisa Raitt as a vice-chair for global investment banking.Raitt joins CIBC on Jan. 27 and will focus on developing and fostering senior-level client relationships and business development globally for CIBC\u2019s capital markets division, the Toronto-based bank said Friday in a statement.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Leslie Patton", "title": "Taco Bell is so desperate for workers it's offering $100,000 salaries", "description": "Amid an increasingly tough U.S. labour market, the company is betting a higher salary will help it attract workers and keep them on the team", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/taco-bell-is-so-desperate-for-workers-its-offering-100000-salaries", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/taco-bell.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2020 1:55 PM EST", "content": "Wanted: Restaurant manager.

After surging to another record close Tuesday, the stock climbed as much as 4.2 per cent on Wednesday, boosting the company\u2019s market value to more than US$88 billion \u2014 more than Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. combined.A bit more good news could push it to US$100 billion \u2014 the threshold that will unlock the first tranche of Musk\u2019s all-or-nothing moonshot award. On paper, it will net him about US$346 million. A Tesla representative didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Musk, whose US$29.3 billion fortune is mostly tied up in Tesla stock, has had a spring in his step lately. He danced on stage Tuesday at Tesla\u2019s factory outside Shanghai to celebrate delivering the first Model 3 sedans to public customers in China. He spent New Year\u2019s Eve at the company\u2019s car-assembly plant in Fremont, California, closing out a quarter in which Tesla delivered a record 112,000 cars. \nElon Musk defies skeptics and meets Tesla delivery goal, pushing shares to record high\nTesla shares inch closer to Elon Musk\u2019s $420 take-private offer in stunning turnaround\nElon Musk reveals how he saved Tesla from bankruptcy while ramping up Model 3 production\nIt\u2019s a sharp reversal from mid-2019, when the shares languished as Wall Street grew increasingly skeptical about consumer demand and Musk called for a \u201chardcore\u201d review of expenses after cutting thousands of jobs.Musk\u2019s pay package is believed to be the largest executive compensation deal in history. It\u2019s structured the same way as his two previous pay plans, consisting of a trove of stock options that vest in increments if ambitious goals are met.But the size and scope of the most recent award is unprecedented. It outlines plans for Tesla to grow its market value to US$650 billion and increase revenue and adjusted earnings by multiples. At stake for Musk is 20.2 million options that could net him more than US$50 billion if all targets are met, according to Tesla\u2019s estimates. He gets no salary or bonuses.The pay plan drew sharp criticism from shareholder-advisory firms but was approved by an overwhelming majority of Tesla investors in March 2018.Milestones AchievedWithin a year, the company achieved two of the milestones for Musk\u2019s award: it brought in more than US$20 billion in aggregate revenue over four quarters and booked more than US$1.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over that span. It also said the next Ebitda threshold \u2014 US$3 billion \u2014 is within reach.For Tesla to achieve a US$100 billion market value, its stock must climb to $554.80, based on the current number of shares outstanding. But it\u2019s not a one-day event: the terms of Musk\u2019s award require that both the six-month trailing share price average, as well as the 30-day trailing average, exceed that figure before the first tranche of options is released.The tranche consists of 1.69 million options that would net Musk around US$346 million if he exercised them and sold the shares immediately at the threshold share price, which could be a welcome payday for a billionaire who told a jury last month that he\u2019s short on cash.However, that\u2019s an unlikely scenario. He hasn\u2019t sold a single share of Tesla for years, apart from unloading US$593 million of stock in 2016 to pay income taxes.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Saddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming", "description": "While economists are forecasting modest growth, Canadians are slowing their spending in preparation for a potential hit", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/recession-fears-persist-among-debt-laden-canadians-poll-finds?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/shoppers.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 8, 2020 11:07 AM EST", "content": "While recession fears aren\u2019t gripping financial markets like they were a few months ago, Canadian households remain worried the nation\u2019s economy is headed for a downturn.In an end-of-year survey for Bloomberg News by Nanos Research Group, 55 per cent of Canadians said there\u2019s at least a \u201csomewhat likely\u201d chance of a recession this year. Only 33 per cent said a recession is unlikely, with 12 per cent unsure.While the public\u2019s concerns are at odds with economist projections for at least some modest growth in 2020, the downbeat perceptions reflect a pervasive sense of caution that has dogged the country\u2019s households for more than a year and impacted their behaviour. \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nTories\u2019 \u2018made-in-Canada\u2019 recession narrative is only resonating because the Liberals have a lousy script\nSaddled with some of the highest household debt levels in the world, Canadians have already slowed their spending to the weakest in at least half a century, in part because they are saving more to brace for a potential hit. That\u2019s bad news for an economy that\u2019s been relying heavily on the consumer to drive growth, given the country\u2019s weak investment and export record over the past decade.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cCanada\u2019s expansion will be lacklustre in 2020, with drags from debt-laden consumers, global trade risks and lingering business uncertainty. The open economy is not immune to slower growth in the U.S. or broader global manufacturing malaise. A solid labour market and incremental policy stimulus should prevent a slowdown from turning into something worse.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Husby, Bloomberg Economics.Excluding housing, annual growth in total household consumption \u2014 everything from the purchase of televisions to spending on health care \u2014 has averaged 1.1 per cent in real terms over the past four quarters, the slowest pace outside recession since at least 1962. Another sign of cautiousness: savings rates are inching higher and are now at the highest since 2015.Talk of a global recession in financial markets had been rife for much of last year, but those worries have faded significantly in recent weeks amid signs the global economy is stabilizing \u2014 helped by receding trade war risks between China and the U.S. and looser monetary policy in much of the world. At the same time, whatever growth there is will be modest.Economists predict Canada\u2019s economy will expand by a tepid 1.6 per cent this year, about the same as 2019. The U.S. economy is seen slowing to 1.8 per cent growth from 2.3 per cent in 2019.There are also indications that consumer worries have levelled off. The results are little changed from a similar poll taken at the end of November. A separate gauge of consumer confidence \u2014 the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index \u2014 saw a rebound in December from a two-month slide, as financial markets surged at the end of last year and sentiment around real estate recovered.Recession concerns are most pronounced in prairie provinces like Alberta, where almost three-quarters of households see a chance of a 2020 contraction. A majority of respondents in British Columbia and Ontario are also concerned a downturn is imminent.

Wearing a dark suit and red tie, his hair gone mostly gray, Ghosn took questions from reporters from around the world, slipping easily between English, French, Arabic and Portuguese.\n\nFormer Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn gestures as he addresses a large crowd of journalists on his reasons for dodging trial in Japan, where he is accused of financial misconduct, at the Lebanese Press Syndicate in Beirut on Wednesday.\n\nJoseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHis flight from Japan, an escape worthy of a Hollywood spy thriller, marked the latest twist in a saga that began with his stunning arrest at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport in November of 2018. Now free to speak his mind, the 65-year-old is seeking to salvage his legacy, blighted by allegations of understating his income and raiding corporate resources for personal gain at Nissan. He\u2019s also under investigation in France.After more than a year in Japan\u2019s criminal justice system, including months locked in a cell, Ghosn has scores to settle. Proclaiming his innocence, he accused Japanese prosecutors, government officials and Nissan executives of conspiring to topple him to prevent a further integration of the Japanese carmaker with Renault. Ghosn named former Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa, Hitoshi Kawaguchi, and Masakazu Toyoda as among those involved in the plot against him. Saikawa, Ghosn\u2019s successor-turned-accuser, lost his job less than a year later over his own overcompensation scandal. \nThe inside story of how Carlos Ghosn fled Japan to become the world\u2019s most famous fugitive\nInternational fugitive Carlos Ghosn has tales to tell and scores to settle \u2014 and now he can\nHow did Carlos Ghosn escape? One theory says he smuggled himself out of the country in a giant box\nGhosn was facing trials that could have landed him in prison for more than a decade when, last week, he bolted to Lebanon in a private jet from Osaka\u2019s Kansai International Airport to escape what he described as a \u201crigged Japanese justice system.\u201d The Mediterranean country doesn\u2019t have an extradition agreement with Japan.\n\nJournalists surround Carole, the wife of former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, during his press conference on Wednesday.\n\nJoseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNow that he\u2019s slipped from Japan\u2019s grasp, Ghosn is taking his case to the court of public opinion \u2014 an arena where he gained a wealth of experience during two decades as one of the world\u2019s most prominent and media-savvy business leaders.\u201cI am here to expose a system of justice that violates the most basic principles of humanity,\u201d Ghosn said at the press conference. \u201cThese allegations are untrue and I should never have been arrested.\u201dGhosn said he would stand trial \u201cin any country where I believe I can receive a fair trial,\u201d but didn\u2019t think that was the case in Japan. He said his lawyers told him he might have had to spend five more years in the country before his case would be resolved.He laid the blame for his treatment not only on the prosecutors, but also on government officials, Nissan and its law firm. Because they leaked false information and withheld information that might have helped him, Ghosn said he was presumed guilty without the ability to clear his name. He said he didn\u2019t believe Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was aware of the plot against him, and declined to identify other government officials to avoid creating a rift between Japan and Lebanon.\u201cMy unimaginable ordeal over the past 14 months was the result of an orchestrated campaign spearheaded by a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals at Nissan and at the Latham & Watkins law firm, with the support of the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Ghosn said.Conviction RateHis arrest cast an unflattering light on Japan\u2019s legal system, where prosecutors can grill suspects repeatedly without their lawyers present and enjoy an almost 100 per cent conviction rate. Under the terms of Ghosn\u2019s bail, the court had restricted contact with his family, including his wife Carole, with whom he was forbidden to speak without seeking permission. On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors pushed back, obtaining an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn on suspicion of giving false testimony.\u201cThis is exactly how it works,\u201d Ghosn said, calling the move part of Japan\u2019s intimidation tactics. Nissan also went on the offensive Tuesday, saying its internal investigation in the lead-up to Ghosn\u2019s arrest found \u201cincontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct\u201d by the former executive. Nissan pledged to take \u201cappropriate legal action\u201d against him for any harm caused to the company.The carmaker has already spent more than US$200 million on lawyers, investigators, and digital forensics in its investigation of Ghosn and former executive Greg Kelly, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Kelly, who remains in Japan, has also denied wrongdoing.Ghosn helped lead Nissan back from the brink two decades ago, following its rescue by Renault. It made him a hero in Japan for a time, complete with a manga, or comic series, celebrating his corporate exploits. As the alliance between Renault and Nissan prospered \u2014 bringing in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in 2016 \u2014 Ghosn became the indispensable man at the center of the partnership.Yet his compensation led to persistent criticism in Japan and France, and resentment grew at Nissan over the lopsided shareholder structure that left Renault with 43 per cent of the Japanese carmaker, while Nissan owns just 15 per cent of Renault. Given its bigger size and superior earnings performance in recent years, Nissan has sought more sway in the alliance, including a reduction in Renault\u2019s stake.Ghosn had harsh words for the performance of the carmakers and their partnership since his arrest, describing it as \u201ca masquerade of an alliance which is going nowhere.\u201d His pledge to \u201cspeak freely\u201d has fuelled concern his remarks could rekindle the mutual suspicion that has plagued relations between the carmakers.QuickTakeEmerging accounts of Ghosn\u2019s escape while under near round-the-clock surveillance have transfixed the business world.On Sunday, Dec. 29, he reportedly left his house in Tokyo, wearing a hat and a surgical-style mask, and took a bullet train to Osaka. That evening a Bombardier jet took off from the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport bound for Istanbul \u2014 with Ghosn apparently concealed in a large black case that was too big to fit into the airport\u2019s baggage-scanning machines.Reaching Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, he changed planes while inside a box. The second jet took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.In Lebanon, where Ghosn grew up and has citizenship, he\u2019s highly regarded for his business successes, and has even appeared on a postage stamp. Shortly after his arrest in Tokyo in 2018, a Beirut billboard proclaimed: \u201cWe are all Carlos Ghosn.\u201dWith assistance from Nour Al Ali, Tara Patel and Kenneth Wong.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "CIBC boosts mortgage sales force after growth faltered last year", "description": "CIBC taking a more 'diversified' approach to originating mortgages rather than focusing on the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas, CEO says", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/cibc-boosts-mortgage-sales-force-after-growth-faltered-last-year", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/cibc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 8, 2020 10:08 AM EST", "content": "Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expects its growth in domestic mortgages to be more \u201cmarket-like\u201d in 2020, after last year\u2019s contraction in home-loan balances, Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said.CIBC is taking a more \u201cdiversified\u201d approach to originating mortgages rather than focusing on the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas, once the source of CIBC\u2019s outsized growth, Dodig said at a conference Tuesday.

Along with declining birthrates, that helped slow annual population growth to the weakest in a century, according to an analysis by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.Last year, Canada added a net 437,000 people from abroad, despite being only a tenth the size of the U.S., helping to drive its fastest population increase in 30 years, even with declines in fertility. \nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nIgnore the headlines, Canada\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong\nAll the reasons why Canada needs immigration \u2014 and more of it\nThe data show the two countries are relying on different drivers to counter the global trend of aging demographics.

During his long odyssey through the Japanese legal system \u2014 several arrests, more than 100 days in solitary confinement, seemingly endless interrogations, and, after his release on bail, intrusive 24-hour surveillance \u2014 Ghosn had been forced to accept many humiliations. But few demoralized the ousted leader of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA as much as having to seek court permission even to call his spouse, who prosecutors viewed as a potential co-conspirator in some of the wide range of financial crimes with which he\u2019s been charged.Carole, who\u2019d departed Japan in a hurry after her husband was taken into custody on a fourth charge in early April, has spent much of the last year lobbying tirelessly on his behalf \u2014 a campaign that was taking an obvious toll. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed our lives, we are scarred forever,\u201d she said of Ghosn\u2019s accusers in a November interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cIt\u2019s been the hardest year of my life.\u201d They were allowed to speak for one hour, but it wasn\u2019t enough; they still had much more to say to each other. As time ran out, according to one of Ghosn\u2019s lawyers, who described the call on his blog, the fallen executive signed off with a simple \u201cI love you, habibi,\u201d an Arabic term of affection.They've destroyed our lives, we are scarred foreverCarole Ghosn \n \nIt seemed impossible to know when the couple would next have a chance to speak, let alone embrace. The following day, the 65-year-old Ghosn learned that the second of his two trials might begin only in 2021, raising the prospect of another year or more in court-imposed isolation. Even his children were being targeted by investigators. Japanese prosecutors had questioned Ghosn\u2019s son Anthony, who was involved in some of the transactions they were targeting, as well as one of his daughters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fearing arrest, Anthony had been unable to visit his father. \nInternational fugitive Carlos Ghosn has tales to tell and scores to settle \u2014 and now he can\nHow did Carlos Ghosn escape? One theory says he smuggled himself out of the country in a giant box\nCarlos Ghosn flees to Lebanon to escape Japan\u2019s \u2018rigged\u2019 legal system\nGhosn\u2019s prospects of proving his innocence in Japan were dismal. Prosecutors there win more than 99 per cent of the cases they try and enjoy a wide range of procedural advantages. Against Ghosn, who was facing potential sentences of more than a decade in prison, they had an even greater-than-usual asset: the full co-operation of Nissan, which had repeatedly made clear its determination to see him convicted and had provided a huge trove of documents as well as hands-on investigative assistance. Ghosn, a citizen of Brazil, France, and Lebanon, had sought diplomatic help from all three countries. Only the last had acted with evident enthusiasm, but its efforts weren\u2019t getting anywhere.Ghosn, however, had another option \u2014 a desperate play, months in the planning, that might restore some portion of his freedom if everything went right, or send him straight back to a 7-square-meter (75-square-foot) cell in Tokyo\u2019s central jail if any aspect went awry. In the Middle East, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and a veteran of the 2003 invasion of Iraq were preparing a daring plan to spirit Ghosn out of Tokyo, under the noses of Japanese police. They aimed to bring him back to Beirut \u2014 the city where he had spent most of his childhood, and the capital of a country where, thanks to his business success, Ghosn is considered something of a national hero.On its face, it must have seemed like a ridiculous idea. While the terms of Ghosn\u2019s bail did not include a requirement to wear an ankle bracelet or other electronic tracker, his movements were closely monitored. Prosecutors had trained a camera on the door of his rented house, in Tokyo\u2019s busy Roppongi neighbourhood, and as he moved through the Japanese capital he was shadowed by teams of plainclothes agents. Ghosn, who has bushy eyebrows, elongated ears and prominent sideburns, would have a memorable face even as a regular citizen, but two decades of corporate celebrity meant that he was perhaps the most recognizable foreigner in Japan. His chances of slipping undetected through Tokyo and onto an airplane would have seemed slim, to put it mildly.\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 3, 2019, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, left, and his wife Carole, right, leave the office of his lawyer in Tokyo.\n\nKazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nYet there was a clear window of opportunity. New Year\u2019s is typically the longest holiday of the year in Japan, a time when government offices can close for more than a week and even the most hard-boiled prosecutors and police detectives take time off to be with their families. Moreover, Ghosn had good reason to believe he could evade at least some of the men monitoring his movements: his lawyers had recently threatened to file a complaint against a private security company hired by Nissan to follow him, claiming it was infringing illegally on his rights. According to a person familiar with the situation, the company\u2019s agents had backed off as a result \u2014 at least temporarily. (Nissan declined to comment.) If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help.In the shadowy world of private-security contractors, Michael Taylor was a swashbuckler who stood out. He protected powerful people and companies, secretly helped the U.S. government investigate crimes, and admitted breaking the law himself. A veteran of the U.S. Army\u2019s elite Special Forces \u2014 the famed Green Berets \u2014 Taylor in 1994 founded American International Security Corp., a Boston-area contractor that provided security for oil drilling operations and corporate executives, and rescued abducted children among other assignments. He was hired by The New York Times to mount a rescue of David Rohde, a correspondent who\u2019d been kidnapped in 2008 in Afghanistan. (Rohde ultimately escaped on his own). He also worked as an undercover asset for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal bodies.Taylor\u2019s career seemed to be prospering in 2007 when his firm secured a Pentagon contract, which eventually paid out US$54 million, to train Afghan special-forces troops. But in 2012, his fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. He was charged in Utah with an FBI agent over a plot to obstruct a fraud investigation of whether the Afghan contract was awarded improperly. Taylor ultimately pleaded guilty to two fraud charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. It wasn\u2019t his first guilty plea. In 1997, he admitted two misdemeanour charges in Massachusetts related to a police report filed in a domestic case in which he\u2019d been hired, his lawyers said.If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help \n \nMuch of Taylor\u2019s work over the years had, improbably enough, involved Lebanon. Taylor was born on Staten Island and graduated high school in Massachusetts, but over the years he developed deep ties to Ghosn\u2019s home country. He was deployed to Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, beginning what his lawyers said was \u201ca lifelong relationship with the Christian community in Lebanon\u201d \u2014 the same community of which Ghosn is a prominent member. Fit, square-jawed and with silver hair, Taylor speaks Arabic, his wife Lamia is Lebanese, and two of their three sons attended college in Lebanon.For the Ghosn operation, Taylor had a partner, a Lebanese-born man named George-Antoine Zayek. Originally trained as a gemologist, his brother said by telephone, Zayek was also a member of a Christian militia when he met Taylor in the early 1980s, according to a person familiar with the matter, a time when Lebanon had fractured violently along sectarian lines. Zayek appears to have been associated with Taylor and his companies since the 1990s, based on public records in the U.S. According to his brother, however, Zayek left Lebanon at the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he began working for a private security company there. Taylor couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and Zayek didn\u2019t respond to multiple voicemail messages seeking comment.On the morning of Sunday, Dec. 29, Taylor and Zayek arrived in a Bombardier Global Express Jet \u2014 a plane with a range of more than 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) \u2014 at the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport, a busy hub built on an artificial island near Osaka. There were also two large black cases on board, according to people familiar with the flight who asked not to be identified.\n\nA Bombardier Global Express Jet on a tarmac in Australia in 2012.\n\nCarla Gottgens/Bloomberg files\n\nLater the same day, according to security-camera footage reported on by Japanese media, Ghosn walked out the front door of his house, wearing a hat and a surgical-style face mask commonly used in Japan to protect against germs. He then took a bullet train from Tokyo\u2019s Shinagawa station to Osaka at about 4:30 p.m. local time and, after the journey, took a cab to a hotel near the airport, the network NTV reported. That evening the same\u00a0Bombardier\u00a0jet took off from Kansai bound for Istanbul. According to a person familiar with the investigation of the flight, the team believed that flying straight to Beirut, a city that receives few if any arrivals from Osaka, would raise too many suspicions.Outbound passengers at the private terminal aren\u2019t exempt from passport control, and according to people familiar with airport operations, there were customs and immigration officials present before the Bombardier\u2019s departure. But Ghosn wasn\u2019t boarding as an official passenger. He was, apparently, cargo, concealed in a large black case that, according to the people, was too big to fit into the airport\u2019s\u00a0X-ray machines. With nothing obviously amiss, by 11:10 p.m., the jet was in the air.Reaching Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport would take just over 12 hours. The team ferrying Ghosn appeared to have chosen its route carefully. From Osaka the plane headed north-northwest, avoiding South Korea \u2014 which has an extradition treaty with Japan \u2014 and then crossing into Russian airspace, where it remained for almost its entire journey. That wasn\u2019t the most direct route, which would have taken the jet over China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. But it did keep Ghosn over a country where he has considerable connections, thanks to his work rescuing AvtoVAZ, a troubled Soviet-era automaker that\u2019s now part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. If the Japanese government demanded his plane be stopped, he might have hoped for sympathy, or at least stalling, from Moscow.In fact, the Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country, and the Bombardier landed in Istanbul at around 5:30 a.m. local time on Dec. 30. Changing planes at Ataturk could expose Ghosn once again to detection. Just as at Kansai, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified discussing the details of the government\u2019s subsequent investigation, Ghosn made the short trip inside a box. The second jet, a shorter-range Bombardier, took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country \n \nSafely on the ground in the country of his youth, Ghosn didn\u2019t have to hide his identity. Although his lawyers had taken his travel documents as a condition of his bail, Ghosn had two French passports \u2014 a rare privilege, granted to citizens whose employment might require them to travel while also handing over a passport for visa applications. Ghosn had been able to keep the second one, under the condition that it remain in a plastic case secured by a combination lock for which only his lawyers had the code. According to a person familiar with it, the case wasn\u2019t particularly sturdy, and with a hammer or drill and a bit of time it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to crack open. His French passport in hand, Ghosn crossed into Lebanon legally.Carole, who had been counting the days since the couple had last been together (just short of nine months) was in Beirut to see her family for Christmas when Ghosn landed. She rushed to meet him and kept him largely to herself until the couple met up with a few friends for a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. A photo showed them at a table sharing wine and Champagne. They looked, if only for a moment, like a normal couple with normal concerns.Even Ghosn\u2019s closest advisers were blindsided when news of his escape began to break on Dec. 31. His Japanese lawyers said they had no idea what he had planned; in an impromptu press conference outside his office, lead counsel Junichiro Hironaka seemed genuinely bewildered by what had just occurred, describing himself as \u201cdumbfounded.\u201d Ghosn\u2019s U.S. representatives at Paul Weiss, the white-shoe New York law firm, had been kept similarly in the dark. So was Greg Kelly, the former Nissan executive who\u2019d been taken into custody at the same time and remains in Tokyo, forbidden to leave the country before trial. (He denies wrongdoing). With no details forthcoming on how Ghosn managed to sneak out of Japan, media outlets around the world began speculating on a range of outlandish theories \u2014 the most widely circulated that he had left his house disguised as a very large musical instrument after hosting a troupe of Lebanese musicians for a holiday concert.\n\nJunichiro Hironaka, chief lawyer of the former Nissan Motor chairman Carlos Ghosn, speaks to reporters in Tokyo, Japan, December 31, 2019.\n\nKyodo via Reuters\n\nGhosn\u2019s public-relations apparatus, which includes top-drawer firms in New York and Paris, let most of the speculation go uncommented upon. That changed dramatically as reports began to appear suggesting that Carole Ghosn or other members of his family had helped plan his escape \u2014 which, if accurate, might expose them to criminal charges in Japan or elsewhere. On Jan. 2, Ghosn said in a statement that, somewhat improbably given the constant surveillance of his communications, \u201cI alone arranged for my departure.\u201d His family, he said, \u201chad no role whatsoever.\u201dEven if that\u2019s true, Ghosn had plenty of help from individuals who may now be at risk of serious legal repercussions. In Turkey, the authorities quickly detained seven people connected with the flights, including four pilots, and remanded most of them into custody.\u00a0MNG Jet Havacilik\u00a0AS, the company from which the aircraft were leased, also filed a criminal complaint and said an employee falsified records in order to hide the fact that they were ferrying a fugitive. Japan\u2019s justice minister, meanwhile, announced the opening of an investigation into Ghosn\u2019s escape, raising the prospect of charges for anyone who aided him. Nor is Ghosn entirely in the clear. While Lebanon is a nation that refuses, as a matter of policy, to extradite its citizens for trial abroad, he\u2019s probably stuck there indefinitely. Japan has requested that Interpol issue a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn\u2019s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive. His life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over.(Ghosn's) life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over \n \nA long-term life on the run isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s not impossible. Roman Polanski, the Rosemary\u2019s Baby director who fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid being imprisoned in an underage sex case, has lived openly in Europe ever since \u2014 protected by France\u2019s similar policy against extraditing \u2014 and he remains a celebrated if controversial filmmaker. But such an existence wouldn\u2019t deliver what Ghosn seems to crave most: legal vindication. His lawyers intend to propose that he be tried on the Japanese allegations in Lebanon, with Tokyo prosecutors providing investigative files to allow their Beirut counterparts to bring the case, according to Ghosn\u2019s Beirut attorney, Carlos Abou Jaoude. Such an arrangement would be all but unprecedented, and, for the Japanese government, deeply embarrassing: agreeing to it would amount to an admission that it won\u2019t be able to get him back. Japanese prosecutors, meanwhile, would be certain to view a Lebanese trial as biased in favour of the defendant. Ghosn is one of Lebanon\u2019s most celebrated citizens \u2014 his face is even on a postage stamp \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine a friendlier locale for a hearing.\n\nThis file photo taken on December 6, 2018 shows a portrait of ousted Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn on a publicity billboard in his support on a street in Beirut.\n\nJoseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nGhosn was awaiting trial in Japan on four charges \u2014 two for allegedly understating his compensation in regulatory filings, and two more \u201cbreach of trust\u201d allegations, in which prosecutors claim he used Nissan\u2019s resources for his own gain. From the beginning of his legal drama he\u2019s denied wrongdoing and claimed that the allegations against him are the result of a political vendetta \u2014 an illegitimate attempt to settle scores and stop him from integrating Nissan more closely with Renault \u2014 that should never have put him in a courtroom, let alone a jail cell. According to people familiar with his intentions, he plans to use his freedom to assail the Japanese legal system and to do everything he can to publicly discredit the charges. His first salvo will come at a press conference he plans to hold in Beirut on Wednesday.Throughout his career, Ghosn portrayed himself as a singular figure, the driving force behind the creation of one of the world\u2019s largest automotive groups and the only person capable of keeping it together. In recent years he was clearly in legacy mode, preparing the groundwork for a deal that would finally bring Nissan and Renault together under a single corporate umbrella. Had his plans to incorporate rival Fiat-Chrysler into the alliance come to fruition, he might have created the world\u2019s largest carmaker and reasonably expected to be remembered as a business visionary, one of the few individuals \u2014 like Lee Iacocca, Jack Welch or Gordon Moore \u2014 whose careers helped reshape their industries. For the foreseeable future, however, he will be known above all as something very different: a fugitive.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Sandrine Rastello and Scott Deveau", "title": "Hudson\u2019s Bay Co shares shoot up 9% after Richard Baker sweetens bid", "description": "Major minority shareholder and retailer\u2019s board agree new offer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/minority-shareholders-win-as-hudsons-bay-chair-raises-offer-2", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/hbc.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 6, 2020 9:49 AM EST", "content": "Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. Chairman Richard Baker raised his offer to take the struggling retailer private, handing a victory to minority shareholders including Catalyst Capital Group Inc. that fought to derail the original bid.Hudson\u2019s Bay said in a statement late Friday it agreed to a new bid by Baker and a group of allies, who together control the company. The offer was increased for a second time to $11 a share from $10.30. Baker\u2019s first offer was for $9.45 apiece in June.The retailer\u2019s shares were trading up more than 9 per cent at $10.80 on Monday morning. The new take-private bid values the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue at about $2 billion. Catalyst, a Toronto-based private equity firm that had waged a campaign against the agreement and convinced the regulator to delay the vote, agreed to support the new deal. \nHudson\u2019s Bay group said to consider shelving takeover offer\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co\u2019s take-private deal falls short in shareholder support, sources say\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co takeover battle heats up as Catalyst tops Richard Baker\u2019s $1.9 billion bid\nThe raised offer \u201cdelivers significantly more value for all minority shareholders, well above the original proposal,\u201d said Gabriel de Alba, managing director and partner of Catalyst, in a separate statement.This \u201cprovides minority shareholders with compelling and immediate value and is supported by our largest minority shareholder,\u201d said David Leith, the chairman of the board\u2019s special committee formed last year to weigh in on the offer.Catalyst, which owns a 17.5 per cent stake in the retailer, was a substantial hurdle for the controlling shareholders to overcome. The firm\u2019s stake amounts to about 32 per cent of the minority shareholder votes, and while Baker now has its support, the deal isn\u2019t done.The private equity firm still has the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances, including if the amended circular for the planned February vote hasn\u2019t been filed with regulators and mailed to shareholders by Feb. 14 or if it is substantially different than what has been communicated to Catalyst.

One official told the state broadcaster that some 36 U.S. military bases and facilities are within reach of Iran\u2019s defence forces, with the closest being in Bahrain.The U.S. State Department issued a directive urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately due to the threat.Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping 4.65 million barrels a day last month.

Four million barrels of options contracts that would profit from a jump in Brent crude to US$95 a barrel traded for both March and September.Two commodity-trading houses called emergency meetings of senior staff on Friday to assess the new risks to the oil market, said people familiar with the matter.Possible retaliation could include targeted strikes on oil facilities in the area, attacks on pipelines or oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Ed Morse said in a report.\u201cWe expect retaliation to be in the region, most likely in Iraq,\u201d analysts at ESAI Energy LLC said in a report. \u201cThis could have significant impact on crude oil prices.\u201dVulnerable TargetsIraq\u2019s oil fields are working normally, the country\u2019s Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban told Bloomberg by phone on Friday.

And this much seems likely: The former head of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA has stories to tell and scores to settle.At stake is Ghosn\u2019s entire legacy. Will he be remembered as the brilliant, cost-cutting manager who rescued Nissan and built one of mightiest auto alliances in the industry?

According to Reuters, a private security firm oversaw the escape and Ghosn met Lebanese President Michel Aoun after arriving in Beirut. Aoun\u2019s office has denied the encounter took place. \nHow did Carlos Ghosn escape?

Ghosn is planning a press conference on Jan. 8 in Beirut, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Based on past statements by Ghosn and his wife Carole, here\u2019s a guide to what may be in store.Japan\u2019s Legal System\u201cI have not fled justice,\u201d Ghosn said in the first emailed statement after his remarkable exit from Japan. \u201cI have escaped injustice and political persecution.\u201d An even more robust indictment of the nation\u2019s legal system is likely in the weeks ahead.\n\nFormer Nissan Motor Chariman Carlos Ghosn leaves the Tokyo Detention House in Tokyo on April 25, 2019.\n\nReuters/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nGhosn\u2019s arrest revived long-standing concerns about the fairness of Japan\u2019s judicial system, where prosecutors can grill suspects repeatedly without their lawyers present and enjoy an almost 100 per cent conviction rate.Under the terms of the executive\u2019s bail, the courts restricted contact with his family. In his Dec. 31 statement, Ghosn called the Japanese justice system rigged and said his \u201cbasic human rights\u201d had been denied, including the presumption of innocence. Those are issues that he almost certainly would have put on the world stage had his case come to trial.Unholy TrinityFor months, Ghosn\u2019s attorneys have been arguing that all of the charges against their client were bogus, the result of a broad conspiracy among nationalistic Nissan officials, Japanese prosecutors and the government itself.The goal, according to Ghosn, was to smear him in order to prevent the executive from further integrating Nissan and France\u2019s Renault, a plan that threatened the Japanese carmaker\u2019s autonomy and was vehemently opposed in the highest echelons of Tokyo officialdom.Corporate AssassinsIn April, Ghosn was detained before a scheduled tell-all press conference, prompting his camp to release a pre-recorded video for such an eventuality.In it, Ghosn spoke of several Nissan executives whom he claimed turned on him to advance their own interests. The original video named the people; that segment was edited out in the version released to the public.\u201cI\u2019m talking here about a few executives who, obviously for their own interests and for their own selfish fears, are creating a lot of value destruction. Names? You know them,\u201d Ghosn hinted in his video. Now, Ghosn may really be ready to disclose names.Nissan\u2019s SlideIn his video, Ghosn also criticized Nissan\u2019s management for the company\u2019s poor performance, saying they lost sight of the need to move the alliance with Renault forward.\u201cI\u2019m worried because obviously the performance of Nissan is declining, but also I\u2019m worried because I don\u2019t think there is any vision for the alliance being built,\u201d Ghosn said in the video.Nissan\u2019s earnings have tumbled to the lowest level in a decade and the stock was the worst performer on the Bloomberg World Auto Manufacturers Index last year (the second-worst was Renault), so he may hit that note again.French EstablishmentIn several interviews, Ghosn\u2019s wife, Carole, lashed out at the French establishment for not doing more to help the former head of Renault, who also is a French citizen.In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, she said President Emmanuel Macron hasn\u2019t answered her pleas for help. \u201cThe silence from the Elysee Palace is deafening,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought France was a country that defended the presumption of innocence. They\u2019ve all forgotten everything Carlos did for France\u2019s economy and for Renault.\u201dIt remains to be seen which talking points Ghosn will hit the hardest. Yet this much is clear: He is a fighter, and he has everything to lose if he can\u2019t pull ahead in the PR war.

The 65-year-old faced charges of financial misconduct and raiding corporate resources for personal gain, allegations he denies.Soon after he resurfaced, the internet lit up with unconfirmed reports and theories of how Ghosn, now an international fugitive, pulled off an escape befitting a Hollywood thriller \u2014 one that will be very hard for Japanese authorities to live down.

He was then shipped out of the country and later entered Lebanon from Turkey on a private plane.A detailed report in French daily Le Monde, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn\u2019s wife Carole organized the escape with the help of her brothers and their contacts in Turkey. After leaving Tokyo, Ghosn took a private jet from a small airport in Japan to Turkey, and from there entered Lebanon with an ID card, landing in Beirut with Carole. The decision to flee may have come because of new information Japanese authorities could have obtained from a Swiss bank and from offshore centres including Dubai, the newspaper reported.The Lebanese newspaper Annahar, by contrast, reported that Ghosn entered the country with a French passport. The former industry heavyweight has Lebanese, French and Brazilian citizenship \u2014 though all his passports had been taken from him. Meanwhile, a report that Ghosn met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun was denied by an official at the presidency.French newspaper Les Echos said Ghosn may have left Japan under a false identity with a forged passport, boarding a private plane from a smaller airport, where he would be less likely to be recognized.The French foreign ministry, for its part, said it doesn\u2019t know how Ghosn made his escape. Lebanon\u2019s foreign ministry said that Ghosn entered Lebanon legally and it was unaware how he fled Japan and arrived to Beirut, according to a statement.On social media, would-be sleuths posted private jet flight information on aircraft that left Japan for Istanbul the same day that Ghosn may have left the country.Ghosn\u2019s vanishing act has been trending on Twitter and inspiring a fair amount of word play, as in Ghosn with the Wind and Ghosn, Ghosn Gone.Ghosn is expected to give a press conference from Lebanon in his new home after the holidays.

Chairman Richard Baker and his partners have approached minority shareholders, including Catalyst Capital Group, about potentially raising their offer to take the Canadian retailer private, according to people familiar with the matter.Baker and a group of allies have floated the idea of raising their offer to around $11 a share from $10.30 a share, roughly the same price Catalyst Capital offered for the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue in November, said the people who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The Baker group collectively own a 57 per cent stake in Hudson\u2019s Bay, but likely needs a majority of minority shareholders for a deal to go through.There are no substantive conversations ongoing between Catalyst and the Baker group at this time, the people said.

Hudson\u2019s Bay didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Catalyst, which owns a 17.5 per cent stake in the retailer, remains a substantial hurdle for the controlling shareholders to overcome. The Toronto-based firm\u2019s stake amounts to about 32 per cent of the minority shareholder votes.Preliminary tallies earlier this month showed that the Baker group\u2019s earlier $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) bid for the company had fallen short of the necessary support from investors to proceed before the vote was delayed by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.Shares in Hudson\u2019s Bay rose as much as 24 per cent on Tuesday. An earlier report from Women\u2019s Wear Daily said the parties could reach a deal within 48 hours. The stock was up 15 per cent to $9.40 as of 10:28 a.m. in Toronto, giving the company a market value of about $1.73 billion.Investor OppositionMinority investors including Catalyst have opposed the Baker bid, saying it undervalues the company\u2019s real estate and that it didn\u2019t provide enough disclosure to shareholders. The Ontario Securities Commission endorsed a complaint by Catalyst and ordered a delay in the shareholder vote while seeking increased disclosure on the Baker bid.Catalyst, which is run by Newton Glassman, had made its own proposal that was rejected by a special committee of the board because Baker\u2019s group was adamant it wouldn\u2019t tender its shares.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Greifeld and Alyce Andres", "title": "The loonie was this year's strongest major currency \u2014 but it could stall out in 2020", "description": "The head of foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse thinks Bank of Canada policy makers will be quick to try to curtail a significant rise", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/the-strongest-major-currency-this-year-could-stall-out-in-2020?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/loonie-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "December 31, 2019 10:47 AM EST", "content": "The Canadian dollar may struggle in 2020 to top its stellar performance from this year.That\u2019s the message from the global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse who expects the tailwinds seen in 2019 to fade. While risk-sensitive currencies like the loonie should perform well if the global economy continues to firm, Shahab Jalinoos believes Bank of Canada policy makers will be quick to try to curtail a significant rise.\u201cThe key risk is the BOC itself, which tends to talk more dovishly whenever CAD shows material strength,\u201d Jalinoos said, using the market abbreviation for the Canadian currency. Additionally, the Bank of Canada\u2019s search for a new chief may \u201ccreate some uncertainty that hinders CAD appreciation,\u201d he said. The central bank has formally started its hunt for a successor to Stephen Poloz, who is stepping down as governor in June. \nForget interest rate decisions.

David Rosenberg says he\u2019s in the \u201971-cent camp\u2019\nThe Canadian dollar is on pace to be the best-performing major currency in 2019, notching an almost 5 per cent gain against the greenback in a year that saw foreign-exchange volatility sink to record lows. Resurgent commodity prices helped buoy the currency, as did a central bank that kept borrowing costs steady, making it an outlier in the global easing trend.For those reasons, Jalinoos sees the dollar-loonie rate consolidating around US$1.28 per dollar. The pair fell for a fifth straight day to drop below US$1.30 for the first time in over a year on Tuesday, the lowest level since October 2018.One technical indicator pains a brighter picture for loonie bulls. The pair trade is on track for a monthly close well below its long-run trend support at US$1.3155, which would provide a clear signal that there\u2019s more U.S. dollar weakness in the offing. While charting patterns suggest firm support for the greenback in the low-to-mid $1.30 range \u2014 a level breached on Tuesday \u2014 there may be little in the way of longer run supports until the $1.28 zone.Still, Bannockburn Global Forex sees the Canadian dollar\u2019s run largely stalling out, with a 2020 year-end forecast of $1.295. While the nation\u2019s economic growth was resilient to a global slowdown in 2019, the data is poised to soften, according to the firm\u2019s chief market strategist Marc Chandler. That should prompt the central bank to cut interest rates twice, a view reinforced by policy makers\u2019 recent \u201cshift from neutrality,\u201d he said.Domestic data since the Bank of Canada\u2019s last rate decision of the year has been weak, with gross domestic product shrinking for the first time in eight months and the nation suffering its biggest jobs loss since 2009.\u201cThe Canadian economy is weakening and the central bank will have to cut rates,\u201d Chandler wrote in an email. \u201cTypically, in a weakening USD environment, CAD lags on crosses.\u201dBloomberg.com"}]
