They have cut their benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, engaged in open-ended bond buying and begun rolling out emergency lending programs as U.S. unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.Treasury yields and the Bloomberg dollar index fell to their lows of the day following the release of Powell\u2019s prepared remarks, while S&P 500 futures pared their gains.Almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March \n \nWorrying ScenarioThe Fed chair in his speech outlined the worrying scenario posed by mass bankruptcies and unemployment while asserting that policy makers may have to do more to prevent it from coming to pass. He said the Fed would publish a survey Thursday showing almost 40 per cent of Americans in households making less than US$40,000 a year had lost a job in March.\u201cLong stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.\u201dWhile the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risksFed chairman Jerome Powell \n \nCongressional lawmakers and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration have passed almost US$3 trillion in economic relief measures, including US$454 billion to serve as a backstop for the central bank\u2019s emergency programs. Democrats and Republicans are currently talking about another round of aid, including measures to shore up state and local governments whose tax revenues have been decimated by stay-at-home orders that have shuttered entire sectors of the economy.\u2018Significant\u2019 Risks\u201cWhile the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,\u201d Powell said.In an unprecedented step, the Fed this week also began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt to support liquidity in the market where large companies borrow.Powell added that the central bank would \u201ccontinue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,\u201d but cautioned that it could only make loans and not spend money.\u201cWhen this crisis is behind us, we will put these emergency tools away,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Rita Nazareth", "title": "Stocks tumble after double whammy of warnings from Fauci and Fed over pandemic economy", "description": "Central bank officials cited risk of the potential for massive bankruptcies that could create a lasting scar", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/european-stocks-gain-while-u-s-futures-edge-lower-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/fearless-girl.jpg", "publishedAt": "May 12, 2020 4:33 AM EDT", "content": "Stocks tumbled after a U.S. official warned against a premature reopening of the economy amid a dire outlook from Federal Reserve regional chiefs.

April numbers are today and economists are expecting the cuts to be even worse.\u201cIt will be far more widespread and we will see more industries that are connected to men\u2019s jobs affected,\u201d according to Armine Yalnizyan, a research fellow at the Atkinson Foundation focusing on the changing nature of work.The closing of schools and childcare centers \u2014 where many women work \u2014 is one reason why female employment took such a hit in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Yalnizyan said in an interview.While economists have started to call the sharp downturn a \u201cshe-cession,\u201d April\u2019s numbers may not accentuate female employment losses as much given huge swathes of the economy are now suffering.Canada probably lost more than 4 million jobs on the month, representing a fifth of the labour force and by far the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.Construction in CrosshairsBrendon Bernard, an economist at job-search platform Indeed Canada, will be watching the construction sector closely in Friday\u2019s report, due at 8:30 a.m. from Statistics Canada in Ottawa. The field didn\u2019t suffer much in March but since then companies in the industry reported significant layoffs, according to a separate survey by the agency.Indeed data suggest job postings for construction have fallen in line with overall labor-market losses. \u201cThe hit might not have been too great in March but we could see more troubling numbers in April,\u201d Bernard said by phone.While Friday\u2019s jobs report is likely to show a more even split between female and male employment losses, it\u2019s still out of the ordinary, according to Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at Western University\u2019s Ivey School of Business in London, Ontario.\u201cThat\u2019s very different than your typical recession which tends to be an 80/20 split,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cThe job losses are experienced 80 per cent by men just because goods producing sectors like construction and manufacturing tend to be more sensitive to the business cycle or at least have been historically.\u201dPath to RecoveryThat suggests the recovery will be different as well. Both Moffatt and Yalnizyan agree service-sector jobs won\u2019t bounce back as fast, therefore female employment will have a tougher time rebounding.\u201cOnce things start to return to normal, it\u2019s probably going to be a female-dominated recession again just because the sectors that should be able to come back quickly tend to be a little-more male dominated,\u201d Moffatt said.Discussions around the reopening of the economy already suggest more male centric businesses will open up first such as golf courses, marinas and lawn care.\u201cWe are looking at initially, in Ontario, a he-covery and that will not be captured by the April data,\u201d Yalnizyan said.Schools and childcare centers are likely to be some of the last places to recover amid the public-health crisis.

And he added that if cases do rebound, it would be like a \u201cfire\u201d that could be extinguished \u201cfast.\u201dHe also dismissed two new projections that painted a gruesome picture of what could happen if the country lifts shutdown orders too quickly: a Johns Hopkins University model showing deaths could reach 3,000 per day by June 1 and a University of Washington analysis showing the U.S. death toll could reach 135,000 by the beginning of August.The people of our country are warriorsDonald Trump \n \n\u201cThese models have been so wrong from day one.

And we\u2019ll have a different group, probably, set up for that,\u201d Trump said in Phoenix.When asked if the move meant he considers the mission of combating the virus to be accomplished, Trump replied: \u201cNo.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Employment Destruction on Pace to Blow Away Records in Canada", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 A report due Friday will likely show employment in Canada was decimated in April as a nationwide lockdown caused mass lay-offs.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/employment-destruction-on-pace-to-blow-away-records-in-canada", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "May 4, 2020 4:19 PM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 A report due Friday will likely show employment in Canada was decimated in April as a nationwide lockdown caused mass lay-offs.The country probably lost more than 4 million jobs, a fifth of the labor force and far and away the largest decrease in monthly employment on record, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That follows the record 1-million decline in March, when the Canadian economy was essentially shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.April is the first full month that strict social distancing measures and the closing of non essential business were in effect. Several provinces in Canada are starting to slowly reopen, which may allow workers to get rehired in May and beyond.Of the 18 economists surveyed, 12 predicted a drop of 4 million or more. Estimates ranged between 1.2 million to 5.5 million, with the median forecast at 4.3 million lost jobs. Economists expect the unemployment rate to hit about 18%, more than double the 7.8% rate in March.The Canadian government has softened the blow by introducing an emergency wage benefit to cover workers who have lost work as the nation aims to halt the spread of the virus. A total of 6.7 million people had applied for compensation as of April 19, a day after Statistics Canada had completed its survey.It\u2019s a different picture this time around for the composition of the job losses. In previous Canadian recessions, it was men and those employed in manufacturing and construction who bore the brunt of the downturn. This time, it\u2019s part-time workers and women who have been most affected, the March data show.Job posting data suggest the labor market carnage may be hitting a plateau.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep rates near zero for three or more years.Policy makers last month slashed their benchmark rate and launched a massive bond-buying campaign to stabilize markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities that had become dangerously unsettled amid the pandemic. The federal funds rate has stood in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent since mid-March.The central bank\u2019s Board of Governors has also responded to the crisis by announcing nine extraordinary lending programs, pledging to make funds available to banks, money market funds, companies, cities and states in an unprecedented use of the Fed\u2019s emergency powers.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katia Dmitrieva", "title": "America\u2019s longest economic expansion is over \u2014 and the deepest recession in at least eight decades has begun", "description": "GPD falls 4.8%, consumer spending down most since 1980, business investment plummets to 11-year low", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/recession.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 29, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The record-long U.S. economic expansion is over after almost 11 years, with the deepest recession in at least eight decades now under way. The world\u2019s largest economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annualized pace in the first quarter, the biggest slide since 2008 and the first contraction since 2014, as the need to fight the coronavirus forced businesses to close and consumers to stay home.The downturn, reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was led by the steepest drop in consumer spending since 1980 and the fastest decline in business investment in almost 11 years.The worse-than-expected report reveals the wide-scale hit to U.S. output from COVID-19 and the subsequent freezing of economic activity. The current quarter is likely to be far worse, with analysts expecting the economy to tumble by a record amount in data going back to the 1940s. Bloomberg Economics has projected a 37 per cent annualized contraction, but UniCredit is the most bearish with a 65 per cent estimate.Crisis, RecoveryThat will end an expansion that began in mid-2009 when the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. Since then, gross domestic product swelled by US$7 trillion and unemployment had fallen to a five-decade low of 3.5 per cent, although some have questioned how widely the benefits have been spread with an increasing concentration of wealth at the top and wages rising at a relatively tepid pace for most of the expansion.The pain is being felt worldwide with China already reporting a sharp decline in output and the euro-area set to deliver grim figures Thursday.As the U.S. government and states debate when and how fast to lift restrictions on companies and schools, there remains considerable doubt over the duration of the economic slowdown and the shape of the recovery.Early hopes for a rapid rebound have faded with most analysts assuming a jump in activity once the virus passes will be followed by a slower resumption of growth. So far, many data points signal a deepening contraction, while others have shown slight improvement, according to a Bloomberg Economics tracker.Consumers WaryDespite massive government aid packages and near-zero interest rates, businesses big and small risk going bankrupt, while consumers may remain wary of hitting shops and restaurants amid health concerns, higher debt burdens and job insecurity.Another big question is how the recession affects the re-election chances of President Donald Trump, who lately has been pushing for removal of the constraints after losing the ability to run on a strong economy.At the Federal Reserve, which slashed rates and rolled out a slew of emergency and unprecedented lending programs, Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues are trying to limit the virus\u2019s damage to jobs and business while setting the conditions for recovery.They conclude a two-day meeting later Wednesday, with a statement expected at 2 p.m. in Washington and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.While two quarters of contraction is considered by most to constitute a recession, the official call in the U.S. is made by the Business Cycle Dating Committee, a panel of economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research. They look at a wide range of indicators including consumer spending, employment and GDP.The analysis can take a while. In the last recession, which became the longest since World War II, the committee didn\u2019t make the determination for nearly a year after the downturn started.In any case, the GDP figures underscore what\u2019s already clear from government data showing 26 million Americans filing for unemployment, along with plunges in retail sales and factory production.The contraction in first-quarter GDP \u2014 the first decline since a 1.1 per cent drop in 2014 \u2014 compared with the median projection for a 4 per cent drop in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In January, analysts were forecasting growth of 1.6 per cent.Spending HabitsConsumer spending, which had already begun to cool in the second half of 2019, fell at a 7.6 per cent rate. Changing consumption habits were evident in the report, as the biggest increase since 2003 in spending on nondurable goods such as food was more than offset by the largest slump in purchases of durable goods in more than 11 years.Consumption is forecast to be much weaker in the second quarter because broader government measures including closures of restaurants and stores didn\u2019t start in earnest until mid-to-late March, and they continue today in much of the U.S.Business investment, already down for three straight quarters as the U.S.-China trade war kept companies guessing, also took a big hit. Companies slowed spending on structures and equipment. Investment in software rose, however, potentially reflecting efforts to help employees work from home.Exports of services fell by the most since 1975, reflecting a decline in international travelers coming to the U.S.The first-quarter GDP figures will be revised several times, and some economists broadly expect the reading to become weaker as more data and adjustments are made.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maria Jose Valero", "title": "Shopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge", "description": "One analyst says near-record valuation 'somewhat surprising' given uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-too-hot-to-handle-for-some-analysts-after-latest-surge?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc.\u2019s $38-billion (US$27 billion) stock-market gain since the beginning of the year has some analysts calling a time out.The e-commerce services provider has surged 61 per cent to a market value of $97 billion.

In Canada\u2019s energy capital, they\u2019re suffering from a triple dose of misery: the pandemic, an oil crash and a severe hangover from a building spree.More than 20 per cent of office space is vacant, and one firm projects more than 33 per cent of downtown will be open by early 2021, creating a cycle of falling rents, declining values and \u201ca huge crater\u201d in local government finances. \nAlberta\u2019s small businesses prepare for deep pandemic-induced recession after years of fragility\nAnxiety mounts among Albertans as province faces \u2018profound adversity\u2019 not seen since the 1930s\nWhat will our post-pandemic energy future look like? It could very well be a brave new world\nIt\u2019s a cruel twist for a once-thriving city that has more corporate head offices than any other in Canada\u2019s west, where downtown space was nearly impossible to get during last decade\u2019s energy boom. The tight market then, and the oil market\u2019s quick rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, spurred a wave of development that expanded downtown office space by millions of square feet.Now there\u2019s an epic glut. Net asking rents \u2014 what the landlord receives \u2014 for high-quality office space have fallen to less than $15 (about US$10.60) per square foot, according to data from Altus Group Ltd. That\u2019s less than half the cost in Vancouver and Toronto, two of North America\u2019s tightest office markets, says Ray Wong, vice president of data operations at Altus.Boom, Bust, BustFour buildings are already completely empty, with the Nexen tower, at 600,000 square feet, being the largest after China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd. moved its diminished staff in the city to a new location. And new buildings, such as the two-tower Brookfield Place development that opened three years ago, are still being absorbed by the market.\u201cThe office market is more than likely going to see vacancy increase, probably substantially,\u201d said Todd Throndson, Calgary managing director for Avison Young.\n\nThe Calgary skyline on Feb. 27, 2020.\n\nGavin Young/Postmedia files\n\nCanada\u2019s oil companies have been hit uniquely hard by the prolonged period of lower prices that started in 2014. The industry is dependent on the higher-cost oilsands, and in recent years those firms have focused on trimming head-office staff to cut expenses and become more competitive with cheaper U.S. shale production.The industry also has been suffering from a lack of pipeline capacity that has made it harder to get its crude to U.S. refineries, weighing on local oil prices and restraining producers\u2019 ability to grow.There was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom. Whereas now, it's been bust for a long time \n \n\u201cThere was the Calgary that everyone was used to: boom, bust, boom,\u201d said Roelof Van Dijk, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Canada. \u201cWhereas now, it\u2019s been bust for a long time.\u201d His firm sees the city\u2019s downtown office availability rate rising to 33.1 per cent by the first quarter of next year, exceeding vacancies in other energy-driven cities such as Houston and Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt assessment values and the taxes that they\u2019re paying on these properties. That creates a huge crater in city finances,\u201d Van Dijk said.The crisis has already claimed a major victim in property developer Strategic Group, which put a chunk of its commercial real estate portfolio into creditor protection last year. The firm said that since mid-2014, 78 tenants occupying almost 575,000 square feet of space either didn\u2019t survive or deserted their leased space.Unemployment RisingThe crisis has rippled throughout the city, hitting both business owners and residents. The decline in downtown property values hurt other businesses by shifting about $250 million in property taxes to other non-residential properties from 2015 to 2018. To ease the burden on companies, the city last year raised residential property taxes.Those increases are coming at a difficult time for residents, many of whom lost their jobs during the oil downturn. Calgary\u2019s unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent last month and is sure to spike higher. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has raised the spectre of 25 per cent unemployment for the province.Those figures all are threatening to worsen in the months ahead after oil\u2019s shocking collapse. Western Canadian Select, the benchmark grade produced by the oilsands, has traded below US$4 a barrel this month, far below the levels Calgary\u2019s oil companies need to be profitable. Kenney has said the industry can expect at least 18 months of depressed prices. That will likely mean more job cuts and more empty space. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-d774699f160ac3a99acb102d6511f984-5ebca7e8b6901'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nLandlords and tenants will need to work together to weather the crisis ahead, Throndson said.

That prompted the bank\u2019s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned earlier this month that the bank wouldn\u2019t be immune to fallout from the pandemic, predicting in his annual letter to shareholders that the economy would suffer a \u201cbad recession\u201d and financial stress mirroring the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cGiven the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves,\u201d Dimon said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe first quarter delivered some unprecedented challenges and required us to focus on what we as a bank could do \u2013 outside of our ordinary course of business \u2013 to remain strong, resilient and well-positioned to support all of our stakeholders.\u201dSome of the damage was offset by gains in the bank\u2019s trading operation, which benefited from record volatility during the quarter as investors moved in and out of positions in response to the unfolding crisis. JPMorgan generated US$7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The trading gains came off a wild three months for the markets, with stocks reaching record highs in January only to suffer the biggest decline since the 1987 crash as the extent of the pandemic started to become clear.JPMorgan shares rose 1.1 per cent in early trading at 6:57 a.m. in New York. The stock has fallen 30 per cent this year through Monday.The bank on Tuesday lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income \u2014 revenue from customers\u2019 loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors \u2014 by US$1.5 billion to US$55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company\u2019s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions.The Federal Reserve had two emergency rate cuts, bringing the central bank\u2019s benchmark to virtually zero. The emergency action came as more evidence emerged that the U.S. economy was being hit hard by the virus and the global economic shutdown.For its part, JPMorgan has been waiving fees for some loans, allowing customers to defer payments on mortgages and auto loans, and removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards. It\u2019s planning to lend an additional US$150 billion to clients across the world.KBW analysts led by Brian Kleinhanzl said in an April 8 report they expect provisions to peak in the second quarter as banks build reserves in advance of expected charge-offs under the newly adopted CECL accounting rules.Investors and analysts are taking comfort in the fact that banks are entering the uncertain period with higher capital levels than they had during the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe company entered this crisis in a position of strength, and we remain well capitalized and highly liquid \u2013 with a CET1 ratio of 11.5 per cent and total liquidity resources of over US$1 trillion,\u201d Dimon said in the statement.While the results offer a look at the impact of the virus, the picture is somewhat muddled because they include January and February, before government lockdown measures began in earnest. Analysts are expecting future quarters to show even more damage to consumer businesses, as near-zero interest rates and rising unemployment take a toll.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Grant Smith, Javier Blas and Salma El Wardany", "title": "Oil price war ends with historic OPEC+ deal for biggest output cut ever of 9.7 million barrels a day", "description": "The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/opec-agrees-largest-ever-oil-output-cut-of-9-7-mln-bpd-sources?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/opec-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 12, 2020 2:27 PM EDT", "content": "The world\u2019s top oil producers pulled off a historic deal to cut global crude output and put an end to a devastating price war.After a week-long marathon of bilateral talks and four days of video conferences with government ministers from around the world, an agreement finally emerged to tackle the impact of the global pandemic on demand.The talks almost fell apart because of resistance from Mexico, but came back from the brink after a weekend of urgent diplomacy \u2014 with the clock ticking down to the market open. \nCanada did not agree to specific oil production cuts in G20 meeting, natural resources minister says\nHow the coronavirus crash is setting the stage for the next oil boom\nAs OPEC's tentative deal falls short, Canadian producers fear 1.7 million barrels a day will be shut in\nOPEC+ will cut 9.7 million barrels a day \u2014 just below the initial plan of 10 million.

That threatened the future of the U.S. shale industry and the stability of oil-dependent states, while piling more challenges onto central banks fighting the fallout from the pandemic.The question now for the oil market is whether the cuts will be enough to throw a floor under prices as demand for energy craters. With countries around the world extending their lockdowns, the death toll mounting in New York, and unemployment exploding in America, the oil market is now far more worried about consumption than supply. OPEC itself acknowledged the challenge, with its chief warning ministers demand fundamentals were \u201chorrifying.\u201dWest Texas Intermediate crude plunged more than 9 per cent on Thursday as traders anticipated the cuts wouldn\u2019t go far enough. Oil markets were closed on Friday for Easter.For the deal to be clinched, U.S. President Donald Trump had to intervene, after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has pledged to bolster Mexico\u2019s oil-production prowess, balked at the terms. Bilateral talks between Saudi Arabia and Mexico continued through the weekend.OPEC+ was also seeking 5 million barrels a day of output reductions from producers in the Group of 20.

The coronavirus outbreak has dried up production gigs in Hollywood, where he works.No age group will escape the pain of the current economic slowdown, but millennials were already on more precarious financial footing than their elders.

Millions of people of all ages are now out of jobs.\u201cI worry about the younger guys more,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.

He was laid off a few weeks ago. Buie had health care through his employer and now worries that if he gets sick, he won\u2019t be able to afford a hospital visit.\u201cIt makes you feel vulnerable because sooner or later resources that you had built up [are] going to run out,\u201d he said.As for those in white-collar professions, Chip Espinoza, dean of strategy and innovation at Vanguard University, fears people in their 30s will once again get stymied in career advancement because another recession means Boomers won\u2019t retire on schedule.\u201cYou\u2019re really looking at a workforce that is going to continue to age and continue to create challenges for younger generations in their upward mobility,\u201d he said. Millennials \u201cwill have to rent longer, co-habitate longer, and stay in starter homes longer.\u201dAlready millennials, because of their debt burdens and a pricy housing market, had been slow to dive into home ownership, a key way to build wealth.

He also said some controversial treatments for COVID-19, such as the malaria drug hydroxycloroquine, should be made more widely available.Burry earned his M.D. at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, but decided to\u00a0become a professional investor after making hugely profitable bets in the stock market. He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Michelle F.

Then one of the bank\u2019s credit-trading leaders, Nicholas Adragna, weighed in: \u201cThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr\u2019s note.\u201dThe trading desk will be in the office unless they have a medical condition with a dr's note \n \nMore than 100 employees were on the message chain seen by Bloomberg, and some were horrified. It came soon after an outbreak of COVID-19 inside JPMorgan\u2019s Madison Avenue headquarters, in which at least 16 people tested positive on a single trading floor. Some employees complain they\u2019re getting conflicting messages from middle and senior managers about coming into offices, where billions of dollars of profit are at stake, and that they would rather follow the advice of government officials to hunker down at home. \nCOVID-19: Fevers on the trading floor test Wall Street\u2019s \u2018tough guy\u2019 culture\nMassive stimulus packages in Canada, U.S. put cash on Main Street in departure from 2008 crisis\nBMO, CIBC join other firms in moving traders amid coronavirus outbreak\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stated many times that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan. \u201cWe have never had a policy requiring, or even requesting, a doctor\u2019s note.\u201dThose tensions aren\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. While Wall Street firms have told most employees to work remotely, a number of traders and bankers who set up at home say they have been getting phone calls and messages from managers urging them to return to offices, some of which recently saw infections.Small and large firms are trying to maintain enough on-site staffing to ensure swift trading. It\u2019s the finance industry\u2019s version of an issue spanning the U.S., where \u201cessential\u201d workers feel they have to choose between keeping their jobs and risking their lives.Trading DelugeSome investment banks have publicly touted the degree to which they are able to let employees work remotely, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently announcing that only one of every 50 workers was on site. But most trading divisions require additional staffing on high-speed office terminals to handle the deluge of customer orders as markets swing. Bank of America Corp. has said it has about one in 20 trading employees in the office. At JPMorgan it\u2019s about one in five in trading.Around the same time that JPMorgan bond-trading executives were emailing each other, Jason Sippel, the bank\u2019s global head of equities trading, held a conference call with his subordinates. He said the trading division isn\u2019t as effective when too many people are working remotely but that it\u2019s trying to be respectful of people\u2019s circumstances, according to a person who heard the call.Still, the situation on Wall Street contrasts with the pressures on tellers and call-centre personnel to show up in consumer banking operations even though they earn less. And outside the financial industry, the situation is even harsher, with about 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in just two weeks, and workers at companies such as Amazon.com Inc. airing grievances over safety conditions.\n\nA trader wears a mask as he works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 20, 2020.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters files\n\nTraders have long been known to work through illness, but in the past few weeks those attitudes have shifted as news stations showed refrigerated trucks outside New York hospitals, medical tents in Central Park and public health officials begging people to stay home.One trading executive at a major New York brokerage said he wanted to be the last person on his staff to stay at the office. Just before he left for home last month, he was exposed at work to the virus. He eventually developed a cough. Now outside New York, he has been working in solitude and staying up until 1 a.m. He recently got tested but still hadn\u2019t received his results as April began.Inside BGC Partners, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, workers received a memo marked \u201cimportant\u201d last month notifying them that no government orders were stopping them from showing up. \u201cWe remain open,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDriving to the offices and using mass transit are permitted in order to travel to and from our office.\u201d Some BGC employees privately complained they felt pressured to keep coming downtown \u2014 even as other memos laid out the option of working from home. A BGC spokesman declined to comment.Still, two people at the firm who fell ill said they had no complaints. One credited managers for sending his entire desk home after the first person got sick. Another said he kept working in isolation until his symptoms were too severe, and that managers then gave him ample time off to recover.Skeleton CrewsMost big banks announced similar strategies for preventing the spread of the virus at work: They assigned skeleton crews to trading floors and so-called disaster recovery sites, and sent the rest home. But within days, traders in offices privately complained about colleagues continuing to cluster around them. Some said they waited weeks for technicians to physically separate rows of specialized terminals.A JPMorgan trader in London said he was initially sent to the basement of the firm\u2019s 19th-century building along the Thames, where scores of colleagues nervously worked side by side. The conditions improved when back-office staff were allowed to leave. He said he, too, has since been told he needs a doctor\u2019s note to work from home.\n\nA nearly deserted Wall Street and the steps of Federal Hall.\n\nMike Segar/Reuters\n\nInside Natixis SA\u2019s New York office, nerves frayed after the French bank sent traders to a recovery site outside the city so cramped that social distancing was impossible, one person said. The firm later ditched the plan and sent people home, where employees received an important email from a top executive: \u201cHighly Confidential: COVID-19 \u2014 Staff Infection List.\u201dWorkers who clicked the attachment realized it was an anti-phishing test on behalf of the compliance team and that they had failed it. Many were furious, the person said.\u201cNatixis strongly rejects any suggestion that it has put its employees at risk,\u201d said Daniel Wilson, a Natixis spokesman in Paris, adding that all investment banking employees in the Americas have been working from home since mid-March. \u201cWe have taken rigorous measures in the U.S., as elsewhere, to protect our employees\u2019 health and help slow the propagation of the virus.\u201d\u2018Push Everyone\u2019Market swings can generate big profits and losses for banks, and most executives agree it\u2019s easier to navigate the turmoil from trading floors, where connections are faster and communication is easier.On March 26, the fourth day of New York\u2019s statewide lockdown, JPMorgan\u2019s Adragna dashed off a note to his subordinates. Troy Rohrbaugh, the bank\u2019s global head of markets, \u201ccontinues to want to push everyone to get back into the office,\u201d Adragna said.A record had just been shattered in the investment-grade credit market, as U.S. companies raced to issue billions of dollars in bonds to bolster their financing. Adragna\u2019s team had traded more than $3 billion of bonds that day and, the reasoning was, that wouldn\u2019t have been possible if they\u2019d been working from home.\u201cWith the amount of issuance trading we can really separate ourselves and do a great job for customers by being in the office,\u201d Adragna wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s attack and use this as an opportunity to differentiate ourselves both internally and externally. LET\u2019S GO.\u201d\n\nInside the Wall Street subway station in New York City.\n\nMichael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s spokesman disputed the notion that Rohrbaugh would push anyone to come into the office and said the markets chief has reiterated on his regular calls that anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable coming into the office doesn\u2019t have to.Elsewhere within the industry, middle managers have cajoled reluctant employees by suggesting that their presence is needed to comply with regulatory pressure to more closely monitor traders\u2019 dealings. It isn\u2019t clear which watchdogs are making such requests.The Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority haven\u2019t been pressing banks to increase on-site staffing in recent weeks, officials said. In a public notice last month, Finra said people would need to telework and that it would let firms improvise systems \u201creasonably designed\u201d to supervise them.Working from home has received mixed reviews from bankers and traders. Some of them grimace at the technical difficulties and chafe at the awkwardness of working among family. Others are enjoying the time being close to loved ones, or finding other reasons to embrace it.One senior trader at Goldman Sachs said she\u2019s been writing emails while sitting on a yoga ball, and doing pull-ups on bathroom breaks. When she has to go back in the office, she said, she\u2019ll miss doing burpees, a type of squat thrust, while listening to conference calls.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Erik Hertzberg", "title": "Wild Variations in Canadian Jobs Poll Reflect\u00a0Employment Chaos", "description": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Economists are all over the map when it comes to predicting how badly Canada\u2019s labor market got whacked in March.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/wild-variations-in-canadian-jobs-poll-reflect-employment-chaos", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "April 5, 2020 11:13 AM EDT", "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Economists are all over the map when it comes to predicting how badly Canada\u2019s labor market got whacked in March.

By the time the dust settles on what\u2019s likely to be months of disruption, Canada could see resales plunge 30 per cent to a 20-year low and the first nationwide drop in prices since 2009, according to Royal Bank of Canada.\u201cThis is freezing the market,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe best-case scenario is we see an improvement in activity in the fall. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s really expecting anything before that.\u201d \nIf you bought a house before the coronavirus crisis hit, don\u2019t expect force majeure to save you\nOpen houses going extinct as Canadian housing market grapples with coronavirus fallout\nMortgage rates on the rise again as coronavirus and oil shock weigh on lenders\u2019 minds\nReal estate, along with residential building construction, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Canada\u2019s output last year, ahead of energy at about 9 per cent. It has been a key driver of growth in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, where an influx of immigrants has fed a boom in activity in everything from architecture and design to insurance and lending.The buoyant market has also been central to the massive wealth effect that has been driving consumption in recent years. The value of real estate assets owned by households has risen by $2.5 trillion (US$1.8 trillion) over the past decade, an increase of 80 per cent.Now it\u2019s just another casualty of mandated shutdowns to fight the spread of a virus that has infected more than 9,000 in Canada and led to 105 deaths. While construction has still been allowed to operate in Ontario and British Columbia, it\u2019s all but shut down in Quebec.\u2018No Buyers Are Out\u2019It\u2019s a big change from early March when markets were soaring. In Toronto, sales rose about 50 per cent in the first two weeks from a year ago, and prices were surging, according to Pasalis. By last week, sales were down 37 per cent and new listings were cut by a third in Toronto, he said.Figures from city real estate boards are expected to show the market fading through March. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday average daily sales fell to 93 in the last ten business days of the month from 138 in the first ten. But sales were still up 46 per cent in the month and prices rose 2.1 per cent over the year. Calgary, also pummelled by the oil price slump, saw sales drop 11 per cent in March from the same month last year to lowest since 1995.In Vancouver, some sellers haven\u2019t caught up with reality, says Ian Watt, who specializes in condos at Sutton Group West Coast Realty.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a dozen listings a day in the downtown core, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would anyone do it? No buyers are out, period.\u201dRobert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank, said the pandemic will be a \u201ctough but temporary blow\u201d to Canada\u2019s housing market. He sees a recovery coming in stages as buyers take as much as a year to regroup and rebuild confidence amid high unemployment. That means home resales will dive to 350,000 units, he said. Prices will fall briefly over the second half by an average of 2.9 per cent from the year before.No buyers are out, periodIan Watt \n \nHow quickly employment picks up will be key. Already, 1.55 million Canadians have applied for unemployment insurance since mass lockdowns began earlier this month.\u201cThe longer this goes, the more it\u2019s eating away at savings, down payments, employment status and income for the year,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, managing partner of REC Canada, a Toronto-based firm that operates under the banner of Royal LePage Signature Realty. \u201cSo it\u2019ll affect qualifications.\u201dThe uncertainty is sure to chill the mortgage market, according to Albert Collu, president at M3 Mortgage Group.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t comfortable about going into a home and taking a look at it before making a purchasing decision, nor are they well-grounded in the security around their employment situation at the moment,\u201d Collu said in a phone interview. \u201cPurchase activity is going to be curtailed.\u201dRebound in 2021?Still, industry observers expect the market to rebound strongly once the virus is beaten back.\u201cWe see the outlook improving markedly next year,\u201d RBC\u2019s Hogue said, estimating home resales to surge more than 40 per cent to 491,000 units in 2021. \u201cExceptionally low interest rates, strengthening job markets and bounce-back in in-migration will generate substantial tailwind.\u201dPapailias at REC said the minute uncertainty is lifted and \u201cyou can go outside without getting your children or parents sick \u2014 I think the market is going to go bananas.\u201dElton Ash, head of western Canada for Re/Max Holdings Inc., also sees markets roaring back. The question is if there\u2019s a broader recession \u2014 and that could depend on the U.S. and how it deals with the virus, given how closely the two neighbouring economies are linked.\u201cThere\u2019s the big unknown \u2014 the elephant south of the border,\u201d said Ash.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Shelly Hagan", "title": "Canada's labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from coronavirus, job posting data suggests", "description": "Postings in Canada down 24%, while only 15% in U.S.", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/hiring-in-canada-drops-more-than-u-s-job-postings-data-show?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/montreal.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 1, 2020 8:20 AM EDT", "content": "Canada\u2019s labour market is taking a greater hit than the U.S. from the pandemic, according to a report by Indeed.com.Postings in Canada for the week ended March 27 were down 24 per cent from the same time last year, the job board website said in a report on Tuesday.

Backwoods is preparing a round of layoffs, wage rollbacks and expense cuts.The prospect is wrenching for Poscente, the chief executive officer, because Backwoods is 70 per cent-owned by the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation near Edmonton, Alberta.

It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had consulted with Schumer throughout his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.The plan includes about US$500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including US$50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than US$350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is US$150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of US$1,200 for each adult, as well as US$500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by US$600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the US$3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn\u2019t require members to travel to Washington \u2014 as long as the bill does not have any \u201cpoison pills\u201d Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the \u201cthe president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation\u2019s economy as we work through this crisis.\u201dThe size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately US$800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a US$6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit US$1 trillion this year before the outbreak.

It also set up programs to ensure credit flows to corporations as well as state and local governments.The Fed\u2019s latest steps landed as investors wait for U.S. lawmakers to deliver a multi-trillion dollar package of coronavirus support, which failed to come together Sunday when Democrats objected that it did not do enough for average Americans. \nDavid Rosenberg: It\u2019s time for investors to start saying the D-word \u2014 this economic damage could be double 2008\nThis is what the Bank of Canada has left in its arsenal to fight the coronavirus downturn\nYour portfolio may be down 40%, but it could be worse if you owned these stocks\nFollowing a string of emergency measures last week, the moves also increasingly push the central bank into new territory by providing direct support to U.S. employers, municipalities and households, which would traditionally be viewed as fiscal policy.\u201cWow, just wow,\u201d George Rusnak, head of investment management at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said on Bloomberg Television.\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll come out of this with some fiscal stimulus as well, and you\u2019ll be set with good growth opportunities in the long run.\u201dIn a sign, however, of just how unnerved investors are by the pandemic, the Fed\u2019s moves failed to spark anything beyond a brief rally in stocks and corporate bonds Monday after weeks of staggering losses.Stocks fell 4.5 per cent in New York. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries initially sank below 0.69 per cent as investors digested the news before pushing back to around 0.74 per cent.Some pockets of the market reacted positively to the Fed moves.

Morgan Stanley expects the U.S. economy to plummet 30 per cent in the second quarter.The package included several unprecedented steps for the Fed, including intervention in the corporate bond market, purchases of commercial asset-backed mortgages and exchange-traded funds, and, if Congress clears the way, a significant Main Street lending program directly aimed at aiding small businesses.Not a \u2018Slush Fund\u2019\u201cThis is not a slush-fund,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business earlier on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism we can use working with the Federal Reserve to provide another US$4 trillion of liquidity into the market.

The Fed will now make those purchases unlimited and will take on a slew of new efforts, many aimed at directly aiding employers and households, as well as cities and states.\u201cThis is a great step forward,\u201d said Julia Coronado the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \u201cGetting to the corporate bond market was critical.

This group is led by Deborah Birx, the State Department doctor tapped to advise Vice President Mike Pence on the government\u2019s response to the outbreak, and Anthony Fauci, the influential director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The advice of the medical professionals has so far formed the foundation of the White House\u2019s coronavirus strategy, frustrating some of Trump\u2019s economic and political advisers who think the president shouldn\u2019t lean so heavily on them, according to two people familiar with the matter.The economy is reeling as cases rise and the death toll mounts.

In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell held a conference call with reporters to discuss the actions during which he reiterated the central bank\u2019s resistance to negative interest rates as some countries have used.

That\u2019s likely to hurt revenue for thousands of companies and put many jobs as risk, if not cause outright layoffs.With Sunday\u2019s announcement, the Fed is firing some of the biggest guns in its arsenal, but economists say without a similar, forceful response from the government, the country\u2019s record 11 year expansion could end in recession.

Central bankers and investors have pressed governments to do more to support their economies given monetary ammunition is running low and because fiscal policy can be targeted at corners of an economy that need it most.Global Easing in 2020\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d it said.To support smooth functioning in the Treasury and mortgage backed securities market, the Fed said it would lift its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and of MBS by at least $200 billion.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester cast a lone dissent, preferring rates were instead cut to a 0.5 per cent-0.75 per cent range.The Fed\u2019s actions followed the Trump administration and Congress\u2019s first comprehensive steps Friday to assure the public that it has a coordinated public health and fiscal policy response \u2014 in what could serve as a one-two punch that shores up investor confidence and helps stem a weeks-long meltdown in markets.The dramatic Sunday evening moves follow aggressive action by the Fed on Thursday to ease strains in the Treasury debt market through massive injections of liquidity and broader purchases of U.S. securities in a measure reminiscent of the quantitative easing it used during the financial crisis.U.S. stocks have plunged, along with Treasury yields on virus outbreak The Fed\u2019s action also comes less than two weeks after it slashed rates by a half percentage point in an emergency move that failed to reassure nervous investors, in part because it was not accompanied by steps from other policy makers. That move \u2014 alone \u2014 failed to comfort investors and stocks ended the day down almost 3 per cent.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s mantra has been to go early and aggressive, so this is the best thing they could have done, they\u2019re really inventing new stuff,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago.She also emphasized that more action is needed from fiscal authorities.\u201cThis is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed is showing its commitment a lot more than the federal government is.

While the data is generally healthy, the gains of recent months aren\u2019t likely to last if coronavirus concerns continue to seep into broader consumer and business confidence The report showed a moderate gain in employment but still reflects a deceleration in job growth from the monster employment gains seen in the first half of 2020 Get MoreBritish Columbia and Ontario posted the biggest job losses; they also saw the unemployment rate rise notably as more people searched for work, the report stated Quebec posted notable job gains of 20,000 continuing a trend of solid growth in employment in the province for several months, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 per cent, the lowest since at least 1976. Gains were mostly among young people aged 15 to 24, the agency said Rail blockades during February caused layoffs within the transportation sector but these were not evident from the data in the report; however, the teacher\u2019s strike in Ontario in February did result in reduced hours worked for the educational services sector The majority of job gains were concentrated in the services-producing sector which rose 24,600; the goods-producing sector added 5,600 jobs All of the job gains in February were concentrated among full-time work and the private sector; the public-sector shed 600 jobs and part-time employment declined by 7,300 jobs With assistance from Erik HertzbergBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Craig Torres", "title": "Fed cuts rate half point over coronavirus in first emergency move since the financial crisis", "description": "Decision to cut rates before scheduled meeting reflects the urgency Fed feels to fend off threat of coronavirus", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/in-an-emergency-move-u-s-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-to-battle-coronavirus-2?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jerome-powell.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 1:01 PM EST", "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the coronavirus outbreak had increased risks to the U.S. outlook causing the central bank to deliver an emergency half-percentage point interest rate cut to protect the country\u2019s record economic expansion.\u201dMy colleagues and I took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook,\u201d he told a hastily convened press conference in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cThe spread of the coronavirus has brought new challenges and risks.\u201dU.S. stocks initially advanced after the announcement before sliding into losses, while the 10-year Treasury yield neared 1 per cent. Fed funds futures are pricing more than a percentage point of central bank rate reductions for 2020, including another quarter-point cut in the first half of the year.The central bank said in its statement that it was \u201cclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d \nU.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rate: Read the official statement\nFalling victim to market fear may do more damage to your portfolio than the coronavirus itself\nJustin Trudeau opens door to possible aid for Canadian companies hit by virus\nPowell, in response to a reporter question about the scope for further moves, said \u201cwe do like our current policy stance,\u201d before repeating the Fed\u2019s reference to taking action if needed.G7 CoordinationThe Fed\u2019s decision could presage a wave of easing from other central banks around the world although those in the euro-area and Japan have less scope to follow with rates already in negative territory. It came hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would \u201cuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.\u201dThe vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the \u201cfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.\u201dThe decision came amid public pressure for a cut by President Donald Trump, whose stewardship of the economy is central to his reelection campaign this year. Following today\u2019s shift he called for more, demanding in a tweet that the Fed \u201cmust further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is cutting but must further ease and, most importantly, come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2020U.S. central bankers were scheduled to gather March 17-18 in Washington. Tuesday\u2019s decision was the first time it had cut by more than 25 basis points since 2008.The reduction marks a stark shift for Powell and his colleagues. They had previously projected no change in rates during 2020, remaining on the sidelines during the election year, after lowering their benchmark three times in 2019 to a range of 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent.Clarida StanceAs recently as last week, some officials, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, had indicated they thought it was too soon to respond to the virus. They pledged to monitor the situation, but argued monetary policy was already easy and the fundamentals of the economy strong with unemployment near a 50-year low.But as the number of reported cases of the virus rose around the world in recent days and the U.S. reported its first fatality, traders increasingly bet the Fed would step in. Powell seemed to cement that view with a promise on Friday to \u201cact as appropriate,\u201d which lent some support to stocks.Lower rates do little for factories lacking needed materials from abroad and are unlikely to spur consumers to shop if they\u2019re scared of infection. But they should support consumer and business sentiment as well as ease financial conditions by making debt payments easier to manage and by calming market volatility.Powell has staked his chairmanship on sustaining the expansion, words he has used to describe the essential mission of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting panel. Despite the limited ability of monetary policy to ease the impact of a public health emergency, the rate cut could support consumer and business sentiment. Lawmakers are working on a $7.5 billion virus response bill, another reminder that critical fiscal policy can take weeks to move through Congress.No Silver BulletOne lesson Fed officials will take away from this moment is how rapidly their policy space is used up in a crisis.Total cuts of one percentage point this year, which several Wall Street firms are forecasting, would bring the bottom range of the Fed policy rate down to 0.5 per cent. If the virus impact is worse than expected, or if the economy is hit by a separate shock, the policy rate could strike zero.At that point, Fed officials are left with unconventional tools, such as purchases of longer-dated Treasuries \u2014 known as quantitative easing. The effectiveness of such tools when longer-term rates are already low remains to be seen.The Fed is in the midst of a review of its tool kit to achieve its goal of maximum employment and stable prices. They are considering policies such as outcome-based forward guidance, where a policy change would be linked to some tangible metric such as achieving an inflation rate, and yield curve caps.Wherever the discussion lands, the virus has highlighted the need for better fiscal and monetary policy coordination in a time of exceptionally low interest rates, says Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives.The Fed is \u201ccarrying the domestic burden and the global burden\u201d because they are one of the few central banks in developed economies that still has rates to some degree above zero, Coronado said. \u201cThe fiscal policy response has been lacking. There are people that are going to be struggling to pay their bills and certain workers are going to lose incomes. This is the shock that needs to be insured and we are really behind the curve.\u201dWith assistance from Sophie Caronello, Alexandra Harris and Alister BullBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Virus-driven interest rate cut could add kerosene to Canada's already hot housing market", "description": "Market poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/virus-driven-rate-cut-could-add-kerosene-to-canadas-housing-market", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/toronto-housing.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 3, 2020 10:30 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s housing market is poised for a hot spring \u2014 with lower mortgage rates likely to offset any major drag from the coronavirus.While a reduced travel from China may crimp sales in Vancouver, and the potential for a recession could set the market back, the possibility of interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada is likely to fuel further declines in mortgage rates and draw buyers into the market.\u201cPeople are not concerned about coronavirus, people are not concerned about recession,\u201d John Pasalis, president of Toronto property brokerage Realosophy Realty, said Monday by phone. \u201cThe only things they\u2019re worried about is buying a home \u2014 and if they don\u2019t buy now they might spend more in the future.\u201d \nRBC widens mortgage lead just as Canada\u2019s housing market shows signs of a revival\n\u2018Rock stars\u2019 of construction in high demand in Toronto, North America\u2019s fastest growing city\nLuxury home prices jump in some parts of Canada as boomers, young executives compete with foreign buyers\nA confluence of factors is priming the pump for a brisk buying season.

Central Toronto posted the fastest-growing population in North America last year with a dozen office buildings and countless condos under construction, along with 25 light rail stations, hospitals and all sorts of infrastructure work.\u201cWe are short actual labour, whether it\u2019s a crane operator, whether it\u2019s drywallers, electricians, plumbers, drivers,\u201d Menkes said. \u201cWe\u2019re short truck drivers, architects, consultants.\u201dOntario LeadsTo be sure, the headline figures mask stark regional disparities that underscore the difficulties Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing. Much of the job creation has been in central Canada while parts of the West struggle with a slump in the energy sector that has gutted thousands of jobs. Many of those may not come back as the world shifts away from fossil fuels and Trudeau\u2019s Liberals push to reduce Canada\u2019s carbon emissions, creating simmering resentment in Alberta.Ontario, anchored by bustling Toronto, added 133,200 jobs for men in 2019 \u2014 sending the unemployment rate to 5.3 per cent for males versus 5.4 per cent for females. In recent years, the province has reinvented itself from a manufacturing hub to a services juggernaut, reclaiming its spot from Alberta as the main source of male employment. That trend accelerated last year when nearly 70 per cent of all new male employment was concentrated in Ontario.Kris O\u2019Neill, a 24-year-old crane operator, is one worker benefiting from Ontario\u2019s resurgence.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there, especially for young people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing in life,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who often works 10 to 18 hours a day helping to build one of Toronto\u2019s highest office towers at CIBC Square, the future headquarters of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \u201cI don\u2019t think since this job started I\u2019ve worked less than a 60-hour week.\u201d\n\nThe CIBC Square tower under construction in Toronto.\n\nBrent Lewin/Bloomberg files\n\nJust under half the 463,100 net migrants to Canada in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 went to Ontario.In the U.S., men have been held back by mismatched skills, a drift to early retirement and the opioid crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump has also clamped down on visas for the high-tech sector, a source of jobs growth in Canada.Male immigrants are more likely to participate in the workforce than women, who often face additional barriers, according to Parisa Mahboubi, a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute in Toronto.\u201cGenerally, immigrants, either men or women, face various obstacles such as language barriers, lack of Canadian work experience and variable recognition for foreign education and experience,\u201d Mahboubi said. \u201cHowever, immigrant women face additional barriers related to household responsibilities and lack of affordable childcare, compared to immigrant men.\u201dTech ManiaThe broad-ranging category of \u201cprofessional, scientific and technical services,\u201d which includes lawyers, public-relations professionals and the burgeoning IT sector, was the largest source of male employment growth in Ontario.Toronto wasn\u2019t the only Ontario city churning out tech jobs in 2019. Waterloo is home to a university that\u2019s at the forefront of machine learning and autonomous technology as well as the Perimeter Institute for theoretical physics. And Ottawa is the headquarters of tech darling Shopify Inc., which boasts more than 1,000 employees across its two offices in the capital city.The company announced plans on Tuesday to hire 1,000 employees in Vancouver on the West coast and open its first permanent office there.If you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best timePatrick Grieve, managing director at hireVouch \n \nPatrick Grieve, a managing director at hireVouch, a Toronto-based tech recruitment agency, said employers can\u2019t find workers fast enough and are prepared to pay up. Salaries range from about $120,000 (US$91,000) for those with three to five years experience to about $160,000 for more senior workers. Those being wooed by large U.S. companies can earn even more.\u201cAlmost every candidate that we work with gets multiple offers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hardest time if you\u2019re an employer, but if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity or looking for a different opportunity then this is certainly the best time.\u201dOutlookRoyce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has doubts the immigration surge will translate into rapid employment in 2020. He points out momentum in hiring cooled in the later part of 2019.\u201cA growing population actually increases the likelihood that soft demand for labour leads to a rising unemployment rate as there are potentially more working-age citizens that can\u2019t find work,\u201d Mendes wrote in a note.In the meantime, O\u2019Neill, the crane operator, doesn\u2019t mind putting in all those extra hours on the job even if it means less time with his girlfriend.\u201cShe\u2019s very accepting and understanding, and obviously the paycheques at the end of the week help,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me, too.

Fear and doubt is not a good thought process, because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action, but to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.\u201dThe World Economic Forum audience included 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who brought a stark message to the business elite gathering in Davos: Everybody is talking about climate change, but nobody is doing anything. Trump has mocked Thunberg on Twitter.\n\nGreta Thunberg, climate activist, attends the special address by U.S. President Donald Trump, at Davos on Tuesday. Thunberg was in the audience throughout Trump\u2019s speech. As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down.\n\nJason Alden/Bloomberg\n\nThe forum is sounding alarm bells on climate change. This year and for the first time on record, environmental risks occupy the group\u2019s top five long-term concerns, while corporate executives say they\u2019re increasingly concerned about environmental issues.Trump\u2019s remarks were largely focused on America\u2019s economy as an example to other nations, which he urged to cut regulations and taxes. Trump sought to take credit for a booming economy, repeating his re-election arguments just hours before the U.S. Senate was set to formally start his impeachment trial. \nRemember Peak Oil? Well, brace yourself for Peak Decade\nIMF trims global economic outlook but softens risk warnings\nWorld's richest 2,000 people hold more than poorest 4.6 billion combined, says Oxfam report\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to declare that the United States is in the midst of an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve regained our stride, rediscovered our spirit.\u201dTrump recounted how his administration presided over cuts in regulations and taxes, and described low unemployment rates for African Americans and women.Claiming CreditTrump claims credit for overseeing an economy enjoying its longest-ever expansion, with an unemployment rate that fell to a five-decade low after tax cuts and spending increases. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, which Trump regularly cites as a marker of success, is up about 25 per cent from a year ago.But his fight with China over trade and other protectionist policies have created uncertainty among businesses, especially manufacturers. Despite last week\u2019s interim trade deal with Beijing, the International Monetary Fund on Monday predicted economic growth will moderate to 2 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent in 2021 from 2.3 per cent in 2019 as fiscal stimulus wanes.America\u2019s thriving, America is flourishing and, yes, America is winning again like never beforeDonald Trump \n \nIn his speech at the Swiss resort, Trump said: \u201cThe American dream is back, bigger better and stronger than ever before.\u201dThe president repeated his grievances with the Fed, saying it raised rates too quickly and lowered them too slowly.Trump said in his speech that he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201clove each other\u201d even after their fight over trade.\u201cHe\u2019s for China and I\u2019m for the U.S., but other than that, we love each other,\u201d Trump said.Meeting LeadersTrump is due to hold bilateral meetings with Iraqi President Barham Salih, Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga and Nechirvan Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, according to the White House. Trump will also meet with the forum\u2019s executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, and has said he\u2019ll meet with business leaders, too. He leaves Davos on Wednesday.This is Trump\u2019s second visit as president to the annual gathering of business chiefs, central bankers and foreign leaders. Hanging over the trip this time, however, is his impeachment trial set to formally begin in the Senate. Trump will almost certainly be acquitted by the Republican majority in the Senate, but the trial may produce surprises.Trump has sought to highlight his trade and economic victories to contrast the impeachment proceedings. He skipped Davos in 2017 out of concern that the well-heeled Davos crowd was the wrong fit for a man elected on a nationalist, anti-elites message. He attended in 2018, then skipped last year amid a government shutdown.Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are the biggest-name political leaders in attendance; Trump has regularly complained that Merkel spends too little on defence, doesn\u2019t do enough in Ukraine and is too soft on Iran\u2019s regime, but won\u2019t meet with her in Davos.Other speakers include teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom Trump has insulted on Twitter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose phone call with Trump triggered the impeachment process, is also due to attend briefly but not to meet with the U.S. president.Once Trump leaves on Wednesday, the U.S. delegation will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Trump\u2019s first Davos appearance in 2018 oscillated between a vintage, raucous version of Trump in meetings with national leaders and business executives and more subdued remarks in his formal speech.

Fewer respondents, for example, expected a U.S. recession The survey questions with the biggest improvements were around indicators of future sales and employment intentions. The share of firms planning to expand their workforce rose to 53 per cent, the highest since the second quarter 2018. Indicators of future sales also rose to the strongest in more than a year Outside the energy-producing regions, reports of improved indicators of future sales are widespread, with businesses pointing to infrastructure and resource projects, population growth, consumer spending and housing activity supporting demand for their products \u201cThe share of firms reporting at least some capacity pressure edged up for a third straight quarter (53 per cent), in part because of labour shortages. That gauge is above its historical average of 43 per cent. The data suggest \u201ceconomic slack has been absorbed\u201d and that \u201clabour markets have tightened \u201cOn the down side, while businesses are reporting stronger bookings and orders, fewer firms expect sales growth to accelerate over the next 12 months. That share fell to 43 per cent, from 48 per cent in the previous survey. Still, that\u2019s above the share of firms who anticipate a deceleration, at 32 per cent Investment intentions also eased at the end of last year, with just 35 per cent of businesses saying they expect higher investment in machinery and equipment.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Leslie Patton", "title": "Taco Bell is so desperate for workers it's offering $100,000 salaries", "description": "Amid an increasingly tough U.S. labour market, the company is betting a higher salary will help it attract workers and keep them on the team", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/taco-bell-is-so-desperate-for-workers-its-offering-100000-salaries", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/taco-bell.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 9, 2020 1:55 PM EST", "content": "Wanted: Restaurant manager.

During his long odyssey through the Japanese legal system \u2014 several arrests, more than 100 days in solitary confinement, seemingly endless interrogations, and, after his release on bail, intrusive 24-hour surveillance \u2014 Ghosn had been forced to accept many humiliations. But few demoralized the ousted leader of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA as much as having to seek court permission even to call his spouse, who prosecutors viewed as a potential co-conspirator in some of the wide range of financial crimes with which he\u2019s been charged.Carole, who\u2019d departed Japan in a hurry after her husband was taken into custody on a fourth charge in early April, has spent much of the last year lobbying tirelessly on his behalf \u2014 a campaign that was taking an obvious toll. \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed our lives, we are scarred forever,\u201d she said of Ghosn\u2019s accusers in a November interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cIt\u2019s been the hardest year of my life.\u201d They were allowed to speak for one hour, but it wasn\u2019t enough; they still had much more to say to each other. As time ran out, according to one of Ghosn\u2019s lawyers, who described the call on his blog, the fallen executive signed off with a simple \u201cI love you, habibi,\u201d an Arabic term of affection.They've destroyed our lives, we are scarred foreverCarole Ghosn \n \nIt seemed impossible to know when the couple would next have a chance to speak, let alone embrace. The following day, the 65-year-old Ghosn learned that the second of his two trials might begin only in 2021, raising the prospect of another year or more in court-imposed isolation. Even his children were being targeted by investigators. Japanese prosecutors had questioned Ghosn\u2019s son Anthony, who was involved in some of the transactions they were targeting, as well as one of his daughters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fearing arrest, Anthony had been unable to visit his father. \nInternational fugitive Carlos Ghosn has tales to tell and scores to settle \u2014 and now he can\nHow did Carlos Ghosn escape? One theory says he smuggled himself out of the country in a giant box\nCarlos Ghosn flees to Lebanon to escape Japan\u2019s \u2018rigged\u2019 legal system\nGhosn\u2019s prospects of proving his innocence in Japan were dismal. Prosecutors there win more than 99 per cent of the cases they try and enjoy a wide range of procedural advantages. Against Ghosn, who was facing potential sentences of more than a decade in prison, they had an even greater-than-usual asset: the full co-operation of Nissan, which had repeatedly made clear its determination to see him convicted and had provided a huge trove of documents as well as hands-on investigative assistance. Ghosn, a citizen of Brazil, France, and Lebanon, had sought diplomatic help from all three countries. Only the last had acted with evident enthusiasm, but its efforts weren\u2019t getting anywhere.Ghosn, however, had another option \u2014 a desperate play, months in the planning, that might restore some portion of his freedom if everything went right, or send him straight back to a 7-square-meter (75-square-foot) cell in Tokyo\u2019s central jail if any aspect went awry. In the Middle East, a former U.S. Army Green Beret and a veteran of the 2003 invasion of Iraq were preparing a daring plan to spirit Ghosn out of Tokyo, under the noses of Japanese police. They aimed to bring him back to Beirut \u2014 the city where he had spent most of his childhood, and the capital of a country where, thanks to his business success, Ghosn is considered something of a national hero.On its face, it must have seemed like a ridiculous idea. While the terms of Ghosn\u2019s bail did not include a requirement to wear an ankle bracelet or other electronic tracker, his movements were closely monitored. Prosecutors had trained a camera on the door of his rented house, in Tokyo\u2019s busy Roppongi neighbourhood, and as he moved through the Japanese capital he was shadowed by teams of plainclothes agents. Ghosn, who has bushy eyebrows, elongated ears and prominent sideburns, would have a memorable face even as a regular citizen, but two decades of corporate celebrity meant that he was perhaps the most recognizable foreigner in Japan. His chances of slipping undetected through Tokyo and onto an airplane would have seemed slim, to put it mildly.\n\nIn this file photo taken on April 3, 2019, former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn, left, and his wife Carole, right, leave the office of his lawyer in Tokyo.\n\nKazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nYet there was a clear window of opportunity. New Year\u2019s is typically the longest holiday of the year in Japan, a time when government offices can close for more than a week and even the most hard-boiled prosecutors and police detectives take time off to be with their families. Moreover, Ghosn had good reason to believe he could evade at least some of the men monitoring his movements: his lawyers had recently threatened to file a complaint against a private security company hired by Nissan to follow him, claiming it was infringing illegally on his rights. According to a person familiar with the situation, the company\u2019s agents had backed off as a result \u2014 at least temporarily. (Nissan declined to comment.) If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help.In the shadowy world of private-security contractors, Michael Taylor was a swashbuckler who stood out. He protected powerful people and companies, secretly helped the U.S. government investigate crimes, and admitted breaking the law himself. A veteran of the U.S. Army\u2019s elite Special Forces \u2014 the famed Green Berets \u2014 Taylor in 1994 founded American International Security Corp., a Boston-area contractor that provided security for oil drilling operations and corporate executives, and rescued abducted children among other assignments. He was hired by The New York Times to mount a rescue of David Rohde, a correspondent who\u2019d been kidnapped in 2008 in Afghanistan. (Rohde ultimately escaped on his own). He also worked as an undercover asset for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal bodies.Taylor\u2019s career seemed to be prospering in 2007 when his firm secured a Pentagon contract, which eventually paid out US$54 million, to train Afghan special-forces troops. But in 2012, his fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. He was charged in Utah with an FBI agent over a plot to obstruct a fraud investigation of whether the Afghan contract was awarded improperly. Taylor ultimately pleaded guilty to two fraud charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. It wasn\u2019t his first guilty plea. In 1997, he admitted two misdemeanour charges in Massachusetts related to a police report filed in a domestic case in which he\u2019d been hired, his lawyers said.If Ghosn was going to escape, this was the moment to do it. But he needed the right help \n \nMuch of Taylor\u2019s work over the years had, improbably enough, involved Lebanon. Taylor was born on Staten Island and graduated high school in Massachusetts, but over the years he developed deep ties to Ghosn\u2019s home country. He was deployed to Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, beginning what his lawyers said was \u201ca lifelong relationship with the Christian community in Lebanon\u201d \u2014 the same community of which Ghosn is a prominent member. Fit, square-jawed and with silver hair, Taylor speaks Arabic, his wife Lamia is Lebanese, and two of their three sons attended college in Lebanon.For the Ghosn operation, Taylor had a partner, a Lebanese-born man named George-Antoine Zayek. Originally trained as a gemologist, his brother said by telephone, Zayek was also a member of a Christian militia when he met Taylor in the early 1980s, according to a person familiar with the matter, a time when Lebanon had fractured violently along sectarian lines. Zayek appears to have been associated with Taylor and his companies since the 1990s, based on public records in the U.S. According to his brother, however, Zayek left Lebanon at the start of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he began working for a private security company there. Taylor couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and Zayek didn\u2019t respond to multiple voicemail messages seeking comment.On the morning of Sunday, Dec. 29, Taylor and Zayek arrived in a Bombardier Global Express Jet \u2014 a plane with a range of more than 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) \u2014 at the private-jet terminal of Kansai International Airport, a busy hub built on an artificial island near Osaka. There were also two large black cases on board, according to people familiar with the flight who asked not to be identified.\n\nA Bombardier Global Express Jet on a tarmac in Australia in 2012.\n\nCarla Gottgens/Bloomberg files\n\nLater the same day, according to security-camera footage reported on by Japanese media, Ghosn walked out the front door of his house, wearing a hat and a surgical-style face mask commonly used in Japan to protect against germs. He then took a bullet train from Tokyo\u2019s Shinagawa station to Osaka at about 4:30 p.m. local time and, after the journey, took a cab to a hotel near the airport, the network NTV reported. That evening the same\u00a0Bombardier\u00a0jet took off from Kansai bound for Istanbul. According to a person familiar with the investigation of the flight, the team believed that flying straight to Beirut, a city that receives few if any arrivals from Osaka, would raise too many suspicions.Outbound passengers at the private terminal aren\u2019t exempt from passport control, and according to people familiar with airport operations, there were customs and immigration officials present before the Bombardier\u2019s departure. But Ghosn wasn\u2019t boarding as an official passenger. He was, apparently, cargo, concealed in a large black case that, according to the people, was too big to fit into the airport\u2019s\u00a0X-ray machines. With nothing obviously amiss, by 11:10 p.m., the jet was in the air.Reaching Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport would take just over 12 hours. The team ferrying Ghosn appeared to have chosen its route carefully. From Osaka the plane headed north-northwest, avoiding South Korea \u2014 which has an extradition treaty with Japan \u2014 and then crossing into Russian airspace, where it remained for almost its entire journey. That wasn\u2019t the most direct route, which would have taken the jet over China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. But it did keep Ghosn over a country where he has considerable connections, thanks to his work rescuing AvtoVAZ, a troubled Soviet-era automaker that\u2019s now part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. If the Japanese government demanded his plane be stopped, he might have hoped for sympathy, or at least stalling, from Moscow.In fact, the Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country, and the Bombardier landed in Istanbul at around 5:30 a.m. local time on Dec. 30. Changing planes at Ataturk could expose Ghosn once again to detection. Just as at Kansai, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified discussing the details of the government\u2019s subsequent investigation, Ghosn made the short trip inside a box. The second jet, a shorter-range Bombardier, took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country \n \nSafely on the ground in the country of his youth, Ghosn didn\u2019t have to hide his identity. Although his lawyers had taken his travel documents as a condition of his bail, Ghosn had two French passports \u2014 a rare privilege, granted to citizens whose employment might require them to travel while also handing over a passport for visa applications. Ghosn had been able to keep the second one, under the condition that it remain in a plastic case secured by a combination lock for which only his lawyers had the code. According to a person familiar with it, the case wasn\u2019t particularly sturdy, and with a hammer or drill and a bit of time it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to crack open. His French passport in hand, Ghosn crossed into Lebanon legally.Carole, who had been counting the days since the couple had last been together (just short of nine months) was in Beirut to see her family for Christmas when Ghosn landed. She rushed to meet him and kept him largely to herself until the couple met up with a few friends for a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. A photo showed them at a table sharing wine and Champagne. They looked, if only for a moment, like a normal couple with normal concerns.Even Ghosn\u2019s closest advisers were blindsided when news of his escape began to break on Dec. 31. His Japanese lawyers said they had no idea what he had planned; in an impromptu press conference outside his office, lead counsel Junichiro Hironaka seemed genuinely bewildered by what had just occurred, describing himself as \u201cdumbfounded.\u201d Ghosn\u2019s U.S. representatives at Paul Weiss, the white-shoe New York law firm, had been kept similarly in the dark. So was Greg Kelly, the former Nissan executive who\u2019d been taken into custody at the same time and remains in Tokyo, forbidden to leave the country before trial. (He denies wrongdoing). With no details forthcoming on how Ghosn managed to sneak out of Japan, media outlets around the world began speculating on a range of outlandish theories \u2014 the most widely circulated that he had left his house disguised as a very large musical instrument after hosting a troupe of Lebanese musicians for a holiday concert.\n\nJunichiro Hironaka, chief lawyer of the former Nissan Motor chairman Carlos Ghosn, speaks to reporters in Tokyo, Japan, December 31, 2019.\n\nKyodo via Reuters\n\nGhosn\u2019s public-relations apparatus, which includes top-drawer firms in New York and Paris, let most of the speculation go uncommented upon. That changed dramatically as reports began to appear suggesting that Carole Ghosn or other members of his family had helped plan his escape \u2014 which, if accurate, might expose them to criminal charges in Japan or elsewhere. On Jan. 2, Ghosn said in a statement that, somewhat improbably given the constant surveillance of his communications, \u201cI alone arranged for my departure.\u201d His family, he said, \u201chad no role whatsoever.\u201dEven if that\u2019s true, Ghosn had plenty of help from individuals who may now be at risk of serious legal repercussions. In Turkey, the authorities quickly detained seven people connected with the flights, including four pilots, and remanded most of them into custody.\u00a0MNG Jet Havacilik\u00a0AS, the company from which the aircraft were leased, also filed a criminal complaint and said an employee falsified records in order to hide the fact that they were ferrying a fugitive. Japan\u2019s justice minister, meanwhile, announced the opening of an investigation into Ghosn\u2019s escape, raising the prospect of charges for anyone who aided him. Nor is Ghosn entirely in the clear. While Lebanon is a nation that refuses, as a matter of policy, to extradite its citizens for trial abroad, he\u2019s probably stuck there indefinitely. Japan has requested that Interpol issue a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn\u2019s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive. His life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over.(Ghosn's) life as a globe-trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over \n \nA long-term life on the run isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s not impossible. Roman Polanski, the Rosemary\u2019s Baby director who fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid being imprisoned in an underage sex case, has lived openly in Europe ever since \u2014 protected by France\u2019s similar policy against extraditing \u2014 and he remains a celebrated if controversial filmmaker. But such an existence wouldn\u2019t deliver what Ghosn seems to crave most: legal vindication. His lawyers intend to propose that he be tried on the Japanese allegations in Lebanon, with Tokyo prosecutors providing investigative files to allow their Beirut counterparts to bring the case, according to Ghosn\u2019s Beirut attorney, Carlos Abou Jaoude. Such an arrangement would be all but unprecedented, and, for the Japanese government, deeply embarrassing: agreeing to it would amount to an admission that it won\u2019t be able to get him back. Japanese prosecutors, meanwhile, would be certain to view a Lebanese trial as biased in favour of the defendant. Ghosn is one of Lebanon\u2019s most celebrated citizens \u2014 his face is even on a postage stamp \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine a friendlier locale for a hearing.\n\nThis file photo taken on December 6, 2018 shows a portrait of ousted Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn on a publicity billboard in his support on a street in Beirut.\n\nJoseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images files\n\nGhosn was awaiting trial in Japan on four charges \u2014 two for allegedly understating his compensation in regulatory filings, and two more \u201cbreach of trust\u201d allegations, in which prosecutors claim he used Nissan\u2019s resources for his own gain. From the beginning of his legal drama he\u2019s denied wrongdoing and claimed that the allegations against him are the result of a political vendetta \u2014 an illegitimate attempt to settle scores and stop him from integrating Nissan more closely with Renault \u2014 that should never have put him in a courtroom, let alone a jail cell. According to people familiar with his intentions, he plans to use his freedom to assail the Japanese legal system and to do everything he can to publicly discredit the charges. His first salvo will come at a press conference he plans to hold in Beirut on Wednesday.Throughout his career, Ghosn portrayed himself as a singular figure, the driving force behind the creation of one of the world\u2019s largest automotive groups and the only person capable of keeping it together. In recent years he was clearly in legacy mode, preparing the groundwork for a deal that would finally bring Nissan and Renault together under a single corporate umbrella. Had his plans to incorporate rival Fiat-Chrysler into the alliance come to fruition, he might have created the world\u2019s largest carmaker and reasonably expected to be remembered as a business visionary, one of the few individuals \u2014 like Lee Iacocca, Jack Welch or Gordon Moore \u2014 whose careers helped reshape their industries. For the foreseeable future, however, he will be known above all as something very different: a fugitive.Bloomberg.com"}]
