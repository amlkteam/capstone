Longer term, fear of new outbreaks may only accelerate the shift online \u2014 even for movies and restaurants, which had been touted as potential buffers for malls.JLL Canada, which uses third-party data to monitor the market, sees the retail commercial vacancy rate rising into the 6 per cent to 8 per cent range in Canada by the end of the year. That\u2019s up from 2.3 per cent at the beginning of this year \u2014 a level Sanderson describes as \u201cvery tight.\u201d\u201cMany retailers are in trouble,\u201d Roelof van Dijk, director of Canadian market analytics at CoStar Group Inc., a real estate research firm. \u201cI think when we get to the other side of this, there\u2019s a real reckoning to be had.\u201dI think when we get to the other side of this, there's a real reckoning to be hadRoelof van Dijk \n \nMuch will depend on how long the isolation period lasts and the effectiveness of federal government relief programs. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a government program on Friday that aims to reduce rents for the country\u2019s small businesses by 75 per cent. Commercial property owners will be eligible for loans to cover 50 per cent of the rent over three months beginning in April. The property owner is expected to kick in 25 per cent of the rent, and the tenant the other 25 per cent. The loans will be forgiven if the landlord agrees to lower rent by at least 75 per cent and agrees to not evict a tenant while the program is in place.REITS including Choice Properties and Crombie have already offered rent deferrals to troubled tenants. RioCan, one of the country\u2019s largest retail landlords, agreed to about $15 million (US$10.1 million) of deferrals for April, or about 17 per cent of total gross rents.REITs SlideRioCan received two-thirds of its gross rents for April, while First Capital REIT and SmartCentres REIT each collected about 70 per cent and H&R REIT got 56 per cent of its rents from retail tenants, according to company disclosures.The cloudy outlook has contributed to a 26 per cent plunge in the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index this year, lagging the 15 per cent decline of Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.Big mall landlords, like pension funds and REITs, are better able to weather the downturn with rent deferrals and can woo shoppers back with retail experiences that can\u2019t be found online, according to van Dijk. Smaller property owners may not even have tenants to reopen storefronts when this ends, he said.That\u2019s a view echoed by RioCan CEO Ed Sonshine.\u201cTo be very blunt, some of these smaller tenants will probably not survive \u2014 I would guess that some of the ones that won\u2019t survive maybe weren\u2019t in such good shape when this started,\u201d he said in an April 21 interview. \u201cWhere we think the tenant should be able to survive, we\u2019re certainly open to discussing further help.\u201dStill he\u2019s optimistic the vast majority of the retail industry will be fine.\u201cOnce people feel safe and comfortable \u2014 and that may be a full year before we\u2019re 100 per cent back to normal, maybe longer \u2014 I think people will go back to their basic habits,\u201d Sonshine said. \u201cThey want to be with other people, they want to be at concerts, they want to eat in restaurants, they want to see movies in the theatre, they want to go to the gym \u2014 all of which nobody can do right now.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Maria Jose Valero", "title": "Shopify has become too hot to handle for some analysts after latest surge", "description": "One analyst says near-record valuation 'somewhat surprising' given uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/shopify-too-hot-to-handle-for-some-analysts-after-latest-surge?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shopify-4.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 22, 2020 11:16 AM EDT", "content": "Shopify Inc.\u2019s $38-billion (US$27 billion) stock-market gain since the beginning of the year has some analysts calling a time out.The e-commerce services provider has surged 61 per cent to a market value of $97 billion. That briefly catapulted it ahead of Toronto-Dominion Bank on Monday to become the second-most valuable company on Canada\u2019s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite index, though it fell back to No. 3 on Tuesday as global markets slumped.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to make money at the valuation Shopify is trading at,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Samad Samana, one of the most bearish analysts on the stock. Risk-reward is not attractive and it\u2019s hard to recommend a buy, he said. He has a hold call on the stock and a price target at US$400, below estimate consensus and well off US$585, its current price in New York. \nShopify pushes past TD to become Canada\u2019s second-biggest stock\nShopify expands capital lending program to help Canadian merchants weather COVID-19\nShopify suspends guidance, indicates it banned thousands of users for COVID-19 profiteering\nBrian Peterson, an analyst at Raymond James, noted the stock is trading at about 39 times his 2020 estimates.Its near-record valuation is \u201csomewhat surprising\u201d given the uncertain consumer spending environment, especially for discretionary products, which Raymond James believes is the key driver behind the company\u2019s withdrawal of its 2020 revenue guidance earlier this month.Peterson sees Shopify\u2019s monster boom as good news for the future adoption of the platform though, as merchants are forced to migrate online, but its expansion may not \u201cnecessarily equate to sales volume.\u201dA likely recession, \u201cif we\u2019re not in one already,\u201d will inevitably see a downturn in sales as \u201cno one is immune\u201d to the pandemic, Samana said. The biggest concern is the spike of unemployment in the U.S., which has been the biggest revenue gainer for Shopify.Consumer discretionary products, sold by many of Shopify\u2019s merchants, are among the hardest hit. While sales decline, Shopify may still be able to get a piece of a smaller pie, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian wrote in a note Monday. However, some merchants are also expected not to renew their subscriptions amid a tougher environment, Arounian noted.The excitement surrounding Shopify has not worn out, however, as the stock has 15 buys, 14 holds and three sells, according ratings compiled by Bloomberg.Shares on loan to short sellers are still relatively low at 3.8 per cent of Shopify\u2019s float, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.As Shopify inches closer to the top of Canada\u2019s stocks leader board, investors are also reminded of the so-called curse that has seen former Canadian technology behemoths like BlackBerry Ltd. and Nortel Networks Corp. plunge after reaching seemingly indestructible levels.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Vildana Hajric and Jeremy Herron", "title": "Stocks surge as investors snatch some hope from earnings and oil rallies on Iran tensions", "description": "Companies, however, warned of more pain in the coming months", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-to-decline-oil-collapse-deepens-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/stocks-5.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 21, 2020 5:45 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks halted a two-day slide as investors digested the latest round of corporate earnings.

He shot to fame\u00a0after his hedge fund\u2019s\u00a0bearish mortgage wagers were chronicled in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d\u00a0an Oscar-winning movie based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis. \nWhen greed and fear collide: Wall Street is already calling traders back to the office\nDavid Rosenberg: \u2018I\u2019m less bearish, but far from bullish\u2019 as markets head into new chapter of this crisis\nBear market bingo: Five ways investors can pass the time during the COVID-19 crisis\nAlthough Burry has mostly kept a low profile since then, he started sharing his views more widely last year to warn of a central-bank fuelled \u201cbubble\u201d in passive investment products. He\u2019s now focusing on the outbreak that has shuttered economies, killed almost 75,000 people worldwide and changed how millions of people live and work.\u201cUniversal stay-at-home is the most devastating economic force in modern history,\u201d Burry wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd it is man-made. It very suddenly reverses the gains of underprivileged groups, kills and creates drug addicts, beats and terrorizes women and children in violent now-jobless households, and more. It bleeds deep anguish and suicide.\u201dBurry, whose utterances are closely watched by the financial community,\u00a0began tweeting on March 23, describing his handle\u00a0as the \u201creal personal account of the real weird one from the book and movie, etc.\u201d He said he began speaking out\u00a0because of how people were suffering from measures taken to contain the pandemic. \u201cUnconscionable,\u201d is how he described job losses in the U.S.,\u00a0which have caused a once-unthinkable\u00a010 million people to apply for unemployment benefits\u00a0in the past two weeks. He confirmed the authenticity of his tweets in an email interview with BNN\u00a0Bloomberg.If COVID-19 testing were universal, the fatality rate would be less than 0.2%. This is no justication for sweeping government policies, lacking any and all nuance, that destroy the lives, jobs, and businesses of the other 99.8%.\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 23, 2020Burry has taken on medical policymakers in tweets regarding the illness itself, saying coronavirus infections can be managed through common-sense measures like increased hand-washing and broader testing, without forcing everyone to stay at home. He\u2019s also advocating for wider use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat those who are infected. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the latter drug a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against COVID-19, but critics in the scientific community have urged caution, saying it isn\u2019t fully tested or approved.On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General\u00a0Jerome Adams said there had been some accounts that hydroxychloroquine was helping. \u201cWe\u00a0feel\u00a0a little bit better regarding its safety than we do about a completely novel drug, even though this is being used at much higher dosages,\u201d he said.Burry has so far refrained from tweeting about his investments. He told Bloomberg News last month that he placed a \u201csignificant bearish market bet that is working out for now,\u201d without providing details except to say it was a trade of a \u201cgood size\u201d against indexes. He said the pandemic could unwind the passive investment boom, which he has compared to purchases of collateralized debt obligations that fuelled the pre-2008 mortgage bubble.While Burry has been mostly critical of the economic and medical measures taken by authorities across the globe, he\u00a0has also highlighted large economies that haven\u2019t seen as much turmoil as the U.S. and Britain.\u00a0Germany and Japan\u00a0have been more measured in their responses and offer a model for the rest of the world, Burry\u00a0said.In a tweet on March 25, Burry issued his own prescription for Americans to overcome the crisis:Prudent plan: 1) Standardize on chloroquine and azithromycin -cheap and available 2) Sick and elderly voluntarily shelter in place.  3) Americans lead their normal lives with extra hand washing and special care if around elderly. Saving the economy means life, not murder.#COVID19\u2014 michaeljburry (@michaeljburry) March 25, 2020Burry responded to questions via email to offer more thoughts on the pandemic and the response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s what he had to say about\u00a0China\u2019s response, how some countries have handled the outbreak differently\u00a0and the long-term impact.How the Pandemic Happened\u201cThis is a new form of coronavirus that emanated from a country, China, that unfortunately covered it up. That was the original sin. It transmits very easily, and within the first month it was likely all over the world. Very poor testing infrastructure created an information vacuum as cases ramped, ventilator shortages were projected. Politicians panicked and media filled the space with their own ignorance and greed. It was a toxic mix that led to the shutdown of the U.S., and hence much of the world economy.\u201d\u201cIn hindsight, each country should have immediately ramped up rapid field testing of at-risk groups. But as I understand it, the CDC was tasked with some of this, and botched it, and other departments were no better. The bureaucracy failed in a good number of countries. Turf wars and incompetence has ruled the day. So the political cover for that failure on the part of the technocrats and politicians is a very harsh stay-at-home policy.\u201dThe U.S. Policy Response\u201cIf there was ever a time for the government to stimulate with fiscal and monetary policy, it is now. Unfortunately, the U.S. has been adding $3 for every $1 of new GDP over a very long time, and interest rates were already near zero. Still, nothing is more important now that loans to small and mid-sized businesses, and the U.S. Treasury, backed by the Fed, is providing that liquidity, which is vital.\u201dPotential Treatments\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that hydrochloroquine is doing something good for many COVID-19 patients. The standard in medicine is a placebo-controlled double-blind study. But there is no time for that. The technocrats at the top are getting this wrong. Do the studies, make the vaccines, but allow doctors to have what they feel is working now. Don\u2019t take tools or drugs out of the treating doctors\u2019 hands. Trump should use the Defense Production Act more liberally in this area.\u201d\u201cA more nuanced approach would be for at risk groups \u2014 the obese, old and already-sick \u2014 to shelter in place, to execute widespread mandatory testing, and to ID and track as necessary while allowing society to function. Again, Trump should get the massive contract manufacturers like Flextronics to make testing machines.\u201dGetting Back to Normal\u201cI would lift stay-at-home orders except for known risk groups. We already know certain conditions that are predictive of severe disease. Especially since young healthy lungs tend to be resistant, I would let the virus circulate in the population that is not likely to get severe disease from it. This is the only path that comes close to balancing the needs of all groups. Vaccines are not coming anytime soon, so natural immunity is the only way out for now. Every day, every week in the current situation is ruining innumerable lives in a criminally unjust manner.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to vaccines, coronaviruses are not known for imparting enduring immunity, and this will be one big challenge. It seems the genetic code is relatively conserved, and this will help the development of the vaccine. But we\u2019re still looking at the end of the year. In the meantime, the world is an innovative place, and I expect many effective treatments \u2014 both new and repurposed \u2014 shortly. The question then will be regulation, expense and availability.\u201d\u201cMedically, the new normal will be the old normal. As long as innovation continues, medicine will conquer everything in our way.\u201dJapan\u2019s Response\u201cI believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying his best to manage through the situation without shuttering the economy. He sees what it has done to the U.S., and would rather not force a shut in, but instead asks for common sense. Japan has certain features \u2014 such as a largely lawful and well-educated society \u2014 that make this more possible. As do Taiwan, Singapore, Korea.\u201dBusiness Recovery\u201cEconomically speaking, we have to realize the policy-driven demand shock will be resolved by 2021. But Japan and the U.S. are putting more than 20% of the GDP into new fiscal stimulus, and easy money will be the rule. Those things will all bring stock and debt markets back.\u201d\u201cCountries will also look to bring supply chains home, and many employees will need retraining with higher cost. When we start working and playing again, inflation may be in store. The other big point is that consumers have learned new behaviours, which will drive business churn.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Kristine Owram", "title": "Cannabis bankruptcies start to roll in as pandemic halts financing", "description": "The weakest companies are succumbing and even relatively healthy firms are showing signs of strain", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/bankruptcies-begin-as-pandemic-halts-financing-cannabis-weekly", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/canntrust.jpg", "publishedAt": "April 6, 2020 9:25 AM EDT", "content": "The cannabis bankruptcy filings are starting to roll in.Already plagued by a tough regulatory environment, disappointing sales and capital markets that had closed to all but the strongest companies, the industry is now facing a pandemic-related collapse in stock markets and ever-shrinking financing options. Pot companies completed two capital raises worth just US$5.6 million the week ended March 27, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors. That\u2019s the lowest level of activity this year and compares to 17 capital raises worth $169 million for the same period in 2019.The lack of financing is starting to take its toll on the weakest companies. Last week, CannTrust Holdings Inc. and James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp. both filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada. For CannTrust, it was the end of a nine-month-long saga that began when regulators discovered it grew pot in unlicensed areas and ultimately suspended its license, a blow it wasn\u2019t able to recover from. \nOntario drops cannabis from list of essential businesses allowed to operate during lockdown\nCannabis company CannTrust granted creditor protection\nGlobal stock meltdown is a disaster for cannabis industry already on the brink\n\u201cThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated what were already difficult circumstances,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cmaking it even more challenging for CannTrust to attract new financing or a strategic partner.\u201dThere are other signs of strain, even in relatively healthy companies.Cronos Group Inc., which is well capitalized thanks to a large investment by tobacco giant Altria Group Inc., delayed the release of its fourth-quarter results and restated its financials for the previous three quarters because of issues with the way it reported certain bulk resin purchases. The company\u2019s weak revenue in the quarter \u2014 just US$7.3 million \u2014 prompted at least three analysts to downgrade the stock.Hexo Corp. missed its quarterly filing deadline and, when it did report, announced $266 million of writedowns and impairment charges. Revised debt covenants require it to raise $40 million in equity by April 30, a \u201cstartling sum\u201d that \u201ccould mean severe downward pressure\u201d on the stock, according to CIBC analyst John Zamparo. If it can\u2019t secure that financing, that \u201cwould put its going concern status at risk,\u201d said BMO\u2019s Tamy Chen.Although cannabis sales jumped as self-isolation orders took effect last month, providing a rare respite for the struggling industry, there are already signs the initial spike is starting to wane.After a notable increase in mid-March, \u201csales velocity meaningfully decelerated\u201d on the Ontario Cannabis Store website last weekend, \u201csuggesting that this recent surge may be transitory unless COVID-19 quarantine measures are meaningfully extended,\u201d Chen said in a note. \u201cWe believe the COVID-19 fallout presents incremental downside for industry sales over the balance of this year.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Brandall Jensen and Vildana Hajric", "title": "North American stocks rebound on news of five-minute coronavirus test and vaccine candidate", "description": "Investors are beginning the week hearing that the biggest economy will stay crippled for longer", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/oil-plunges-to-2002-lows-shares-sink-again?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/wall-stree.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 30, 2020 4:21 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks rallied as investors saw glimmers of optimism in efforts to deliver rapid testing for the new coronavirus.

A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic. Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000.

That announcement may have contributed to the stock market\u2019s late-day swoon. \nHere\u2019s what the investing pros are buying amid the coronavirus volatility\nRetail investors say they\u2019re losing thousands as brokerages struggle with record traffic due to coronavirus panic\nEven unlimited quantitative easing from the Fed can\u2019t buoy markets\n\u201cWhen some of the short-term traders saw that, they decided to take some chips off the table in front of the weekend,\u201d said Matt Maley, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. \u201cThey probably decided it was a good idea to pare back some of their long positions in front of the weekend.\u201dInvestors had piled back into the battered U.S. equity market this week on speculation that the massive relief bill would offset some of the pandemic\u2019s impact on businesses and households. A debate has ensued over whether that furious rally represented unwarranted optimism or the start of a long-term upswing.What remains clear is that the virus has ground the American economy to a near total halt, with new jobless claims spiking above 3 million as large areas of the country remain virtually locked down to slow the spread of the infection. A measure of U.S. consumer confidence fell the most since 2008. West Texas crude declined, setting up a fifth straight week of losses. The dollar had its worst five-day skid since 2009.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was led lower by banks and real estate shares after the region\u2019s leaders struggled to agree on a concrete strategy to contain the fallout of the pandemic. Asian equities mostly rose, though shares in Australia slumped. The pound gained even as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus.The recent revival of risk appetite looks sure to be tested by the continuing spread of the infection and the crippling effect of business closures. Tokyo is now seeing a surge in cases, while global deaths from the pandemic surpassed 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India on Friday became the latest central bank to step up emergency action to cushion the economic impact.\u201cIt is by no means a given that volatility has ceased to be a feature of global equity markets,\u201d said Paul Markham, global equities portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. \u201cMarkets will oscillate between the reassurance that governments and central banks will be standing by to support them and the uncertainty of both the duration and depth of what will undoubtedly be a significant economic impact.\u201dThese are the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 Index decreased 3.4% as of 4 p.m. New York time.

The market was about 1 per cent away from that as of noon on Wednesday.\u201cThe 2016 low is a key support level and one we are watching right now. This is an important technical support level that we would expect to hold. Given valuation, the current market environment is very similar to 2014-16 not only within the energy sector but financials and other areas of the market.\u201d\u201cIn 2016 there were many great opportunities for investors based on valuation and dividend yields. This environment is very reminiscent of that.\u201d\u201cI am as close to the markets now as when I am in the office.

It\u2019s cozy to say the least.\u201dLiquid ETFsDavid Prince, founder of Harbinger Capital Markets Inc.:\u201cWhen I am talking to the traders, I\u2019m focused on ETFs, it\u2019s because that\u2019s where the volume is and that\u2019s where the biggest volatility has been. But at least it\u2019s tradeable and those ETFs are primarily in the U.S. and that\u2019s what I have been recommending people invest.\u201d He pointed to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF as examples of liquid ETFs.He recommends Canadian investors continue buying U.S. dollars and luxury goods providers with global supply chains, such as Burberry Group Plc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. The return of Chinese shoppers to glitzy malls and boutiques will help boost demand for these types of companies, he said.Energy stocks now have smaller weighting on the Canadian benchmark than they did four years ago, Prince said.

The loonie has weakened almost 6 per cent this year against the greenback and government bond yields have plumbed record lows.The stock index has tumbled 30 per cent in three weeks since its Feb. 20 peak, battered by concerns on the virus and plunging oil prices.

Around the table were Lesley Marks, chief investment strategist at BMO Private Wealth; Rob Vanderhooft, chief investment officer of TD Asset Management, which manages $394 billion (US$286 billion); and Kevin McCreadie, CEO and CIO of AGF Management Ltd., who sets the direction for about $37.4 billion in assets.Here\u2019s a synopsis of the discussion.Market Structure TestFinancial markets are experiencing extreme movements not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But the structure of the market has changed since then and that\u2019s a factor in the volatility, said Marks.Exchange-traded funds are now an easier way for investors to move money quickly. \u201cHistorically, it may have taken a longer period of time to move money in and out of asset classes versus using an ETF,\u201d she said.ETF assets had grown to more than US$5 trillion globally this year compared with about US$700 billion when the financial crisis first started, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Program trading may be another reason that activity is frantic in the first and last 30 minutes of any trading day and quieter in between.Vanderhooft at TD said a dramatic drop in liquidity is also contributing to the downturn. \u201cLiquidity is a coward and it disappears at times of market disruptions and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dEither way the market is a different beast, the strategists said.\u201cThey are not traditional market makers any longer,\u201d said McCreadie. \u201cI think in this period of volatility, we will see how the market structure has evolved and will it hold up.\u201dOil And TroubleThe hit to oil prices is compounding the damage from the virus pandemic in Canada, where 15 per cent of the TSX index is made up of energy stocks. The breakup of the OPEC+ alliance led to a swift price war on crude, with catastrophic consequence for the oil patch. The country\u2019s benchmark crude, Western Canadian Select, is at US$18.74 a barrel.\u201cIf you look at the impact on the oil market, it\u2019s very, very negative for Western Canada,\u201d Vanderhooft said. \u201cAs bad as US$31 WTI is, US$20 WCS is a lot worse. A lot of companies that were already teetering will go under.\u201dSmaller producers may have a harder time surviving the current crash in prices than during the 2014 crisis because banks are less inclined to prop them up, added McCreadie.\u201cThis time around a lot of these smaller players aren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be dealing with bankruptcies.\u201dThe increased focus on climate change and sustainability may be factoring into banks\u2019 thinking more now, said Marks. \u201cYou already had that major headwind without the latest crisis, without a price war, without the situation between the Saudis and the Russians. We think this will just fuel the fire.\u201dVanderhooft said that his firm has moved to a \u201cmore negative position\u201d on the Canadian dollar as a result of the oil-price hit. The loonie hit fresh four-year lows at one point on Thursday.Carry OnAll three strategists say the markets will come back. McCreadie and Vanderhooft see the current turmoil as different than 2008.\u201c2008 was a true credit crunch, people didn\u2019t trust each other, banks stopped lending, there was no repo. The world stopped,\u201d McCreadie said, adding there\u2019s unlikely to be \u201csystem failure\u201d now.As coronavirus cases start to ebb, as they have in China, that will likely be when the market begins to turn back up, especially if governments get their act together with fiscal stimulus to aid the economy.We're not playing this as a multi-year bear marketKevin McCreadie \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing this as a multi-year bear market,\u201d he said, though odds of a recession in North America have clearly risen. \u201cI think it could be the pause that resets the cycle.\u201dMarks said BMO hasn\u2019t seen any substantial fear when it comes to asset outflows, with much of the money shifting to bonds from equities. \u201cIn conversations with clients, we haven\u2019t seen that sense, that pervasive sense of panicking, that \u2018Get me out of the market\u2019 across the board.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe will get through this event,\u201d McCreadie said. \u201cWe always do.\u201dNext Steps\u201cYou talk about fully balanced portfolios, that\u2019s where clients need to be,\u201d said Vanderhooft. \u201cAt times of stress like this, you kind of figure out why that\u2019s the case.\u201dMcCreadie\u2019s team at AGF will be looking at paring back investments that have generated double-digit returns and add some of its cash back into markets over the next few weeks.Marks said she is standing pat after BMO Private Wealth\u2019s Investment Counsel Business reduced its equity exposure in November. While stocks have become cheaper, the lack of visibility makes it \u201chard to have conviction to step in,\u201d she said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Katherine Greifeld and Sarah Ponczek", "title": "Stocks roar back as governments pledge to step up virus response", "description": "The S&P 500\u2019s gain Friday was its biggest since 2008, even as the gauge lost 11 per cent this week", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/asia-stocks-set-to-tumble-after-wall-street-rout-markets-wrap?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-9.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 12, 2020 6:00 PM EDT", "content": "U.S. stocks jumped as President Donald Trump joined other world leaders in seeking to reassure investors that they\u2019ll step up efforts to protect the economy from the coronavirus fallout.The S&P 500 rose more than 9 per cent, providing some respite after stocks\u2019 worst day since 1987, as Trump declared a national emergency to help combat the virus, moved to prop up energy prices and said the private sector will help with efforts to expand testing.

Cases are continuing to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses are weighing on sentiment.

Western Canada Select, the benchmark grade produced by Canada\u2019s oil sands, was down about 19 per cent to US$22.71 a barrel on Monday, in line with the 20 per cent drop for West Texas Intermediate.Canadian producers, particularly those focused in the higher-cost oilsands, have spent years trying to make their operations more efficient. They\u2019ve also curtailed capital spending and worked to repair their balance sheets. Now those efforts will be put to the test. \nFor Alberta's embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nGlobal stampede out of stocks and oil collapse trample loonie, Canadian energy shares\nOil crash sends a new shock through world already crippled by coronavirus\n\u201cAt these commodity prices, nobody is making money and everybody is going to be free cash flow negative,\u201d said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Corp. in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dThe oil decline hammered Canadian energy stocks. The 30-company S&P/TSX energy index plunged as much as 22 per cent Monday, its biggest intraday decline in Bloomberg data stretching back to 1988. Among the biggest decliners were Cenovus Energy Inc., which dropped as much as 49 per cent, and MEG Energy Corp., which tumbled as much as 47 per cent.To be sure, the long period of retrenchment leaves some Calgary-based producers better prepared for the current crisis than they were for the 2014 crash, which saw U.S. crude prices plummet from above US$100 a barrel in July 2014 to about US$26 less than two years later.For example, Suncor Energy Inc., Canada\u2019s largest integrated oil company, last month reported a cash operating cost of $28.55 per barrel in its oilsands operations last quarter, down 17 per cent from five years ago. The company has net debt of 1.22 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, down from 1.49 times in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. had adjusted cash production costs of $21.05 a barrel in 2018, down 43 per cent from $37.18 in 2014. The company had net debt of two times its Ebitda at the end of last year, down from three times in 2015.Below Break EvenCanadian energy companies \u201care better equipped today than their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Darrell Bishop, an analyst at Haywood Securities, said in a note. \u201cWhile in 2014, U.S. companies levered up with higher-yield debt for growth, Canadian companies cut spending and growth plans and focused on getting balance sheets in order.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen how deep the current decline will go and how long it will last. Any severe, prolonged downturn in prices would hurt Canada, which depends on the energy industry for about 10 per cent of gross domestic product and a fifth of its exports.Oilsands producers will rarely shut in operations amid depressed prices because many of their costs are fixed and shutdowns can damage reservoirs. Some may try to prolong maintenance work on their facilities while prices are depressed but they have cut operating costs about as much as they can since the last downturn, Mark Oberstoetter, lead analyst for upstream research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone.Oil prices this low will hurt other oil countries, including the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia, Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg Television. About a third of U.S. exploration and production companies need WTI prices of US$55 a barrel to break even, and with prices at their current levels \u2014 WTI was trading at about US$33.50 at 11 a.m. Eastern time \u2014 some of those companies may go under, sowing the seeds of a price recovery, he said.\u201cThe industry simply doesn\u2019t work at these prices,\u201d Ollenberger said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean U.S. shale or Canadian oilsands.

Brent crude tumbled by almost a third to US$31 a barrel on Monday, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. told clients it could quickly dip into the US$20s.Such an extraordinary slump, if sustained, would savage national budgets from Venezuela to Iran, threaten the heartland of America\u2019s shale revolution and upend politics around the world. For central bankers, the prospect of destabilizing prices are an added complication as they try to model the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the economy. And a long period of cheap oil prices could even hurt the fight against climate change by slowing the transition to renewable energy. \nOil drops 31% in worst loss since the Gulf War as price fight breaks out\nFor Alberta\u2019s embattled energy industry, Saudi price war is nothing short of catastrophic\nCanadian energy shares, loonie getting crushed in global stampede out of stocks\n\u201cSomething like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy,\u201d said Rohitesh Dhawan, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group in London.There are winners from rock-bottom oil prices \u2014 among them China, the world\u2019s largest oil importer, whose recovery from the virus will be key for the global economy.Something like this could have more global repercussions than a trade war between China and the U.S. because oil touches so many things in the world economy \n \nBut this time is different. The U.S. \u2014 once a winner from low oil \u2014 is now an exporter rather than a buyer. And the hit to economic demand from the virus dulls the impact of any stimulus that cheap oil might provide. Oil shocks \u2014 on the way up \u2014 used to be feared for their impact on inflation. Now in a world where central bankers desperately pursue price growth, the opposite dynamic is at play.\u201cLower oil prices will still not get people back in trains, planes, and automobiles, and stimulating the economic sectors most heavily hit,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist with Axicorp Ltd. \u201cBut now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown.\u201dRussian StrategyThe crisis was precipitated when Russia refused to yield to a Saudi-led gamble to force Moscow to join OPEC in production cuts. OPEC presented a take-it-or-leave-it plan to slash production and throw a floor under prices. But Russia had another idea: its strategy was to squeeze American shale producers, which have flooded the market in recent years as OPEC+ nations held back their own production.Now many of those U.S. operators will be losing money on every barrel of oil they produce and, unless there\u2019s a dramatic recovery in the price, face bankruptcy. Even before Friday\u2019s catastrophic meeting, banks were expected to restrict lending to shale drillers and a chunk of high-yield energy debt is already trading at distressed levels.The last bust in the U.S. shale industry \u2014 when prices went as low as US$26 \u2014 contributed to a manufacturing recession in 2016, when industrial regions, many in states likely to swing this year\u2019s presidential election, saw a slowdown in orders from new shale oil projects.Now we have a financial disaster brewing in the form of the shale industry meltdown \n \nRussia was willing to walk away from talks with OPEC in order to hurt U.S. rivals as it\u2019s more resilient to lower prices. It has a floating currency \u2014 unlike Saudi Arabia \u2014 and can sustain its budget with lower oil revenues.\u201cRussia and President Putin are in a better position to fight this war than is Saudi Arabia or its Crown Prince,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro Advisory, a Moscow-based consultancy.The threat of economic \u2014 and even political \u2014 self-harm didn\u2019t dissuade Saudi Arabia from launching a price war on Saturday in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to cut production. But crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will see his plan to retool the economy undermined as he moves to cement his political dominance.Aramco RoutSaudi Aramco \u2014 the national oil company listed on the stock market last year in a deal that put the prince\u2019s credibility on the line \u2014 saw its shares plunge 9 per cent on Sunday and another 10 per cent on Monday in a sign of the instability ahead.\u201cOil prices at sustained lows of US$40 for five years is crisis time in Oman first, then Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with defaults, peg devaluations, hefty spending cuts and higher taxes, with deep recessions and insolvent banks,\u201d said Rory Fyfe, chief economist at MENA Advisors. At US$20, it would force political change in Saudi Arabia and the region, he said.The crash means Gulf powers may also end up with less cash to spend on conflicts in the wider region, according to Steffen Hertog, a Gulf specialist at the London School of Economics. That could favour Russia, which has been playing an increasingly prominent role in the region.\n\nOil tanks at Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMaxim Shemetov/Reuters files\n\nMore immediate will be the shock to oil majors such as BP Plc, and their response will have ramifications well beyond their investors. Chief Executive Bernard Looney is trying to transform his company in the face of climate change, while also reducing debt and maintaining a generous dividend.The payout is all but sacred \u2014 as it is for Royal Dutch Shell Plc \u2014 though market gauges already indicate investors doubt it\u2019s sustainable. Looney vows he can maintain the dividend and become a greener company at the same time, though he underlined last month the need for a healthy oil and gas business to fund the transition. A price crash will push balance sheets to the limit.\u201cSharply lower oil prices for a sustained period with a concurrent OPEC+ driven supply shock and virus demand shock almost certainly means oil majors\u2019 energy transition plans and climate ambitions will be obstructed or slowed, at least in the near-term,\u201d said Will Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIn the face of oil at US$40 or lower, these companies will be battening down the hatches. The first priority is protecting the dividend.\u201dThe crash imposes another body blow for credit markets, thanks to the energy industry\u2019s outsize share of U.S. high-yield securities. America and Europe were already shutting down to new debt issuance, and the oil crisis now threatens to trigger an outright funding squeeze should distressed borrowers prove unable to roll over maturing debt. Premiums on U.S. junk bonds soared last week to 550 basis points over Treasuries, the highest since 2016.Going GreenA slowdown in green plans isn\u2019t the only risk the price crash could pose for the transition to a cleaner economy. Cheap fossil fuels tend to encourage their use \u2014 increasing emissions \u2014 and dissuade users from switching to alternatives.On the flip side, lower oil prices could allow governments to cut subsidies and increase taxes on fossil-fuel consumption and use revenues to invest in renewable projects, said Ivetta Gerasimchuk at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. And for Europe \u2014 which is leading the charge on climate change policies \u2014 the impact of cheap oil is still an economic boost, potentially giving governments more room to fund green projects.The key question is how long the rout continues. OPEC+ members appear to be keeping the channels of communication open and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance wasn\u2019t dead even as he swept out of Vienna on Friday, leaving his counterparts in shock. But each side wants the other to blink first.\u201cThe Saudi intention is to force Russia back to the negotiating table by engineering an oil price collapse. Most structural indicators suggest, however, that Russia is more resilient to lower oil prices than Saudi Arabia, so it\u2019s not clear this will work,\u201d said the LSE\u2019s Hertog, author of \u2018Princes, Brokers, and Bureaucrats: Oil and the State in Saudi Arabia\u2019.\u201cIn the end, this will be Putin\u2019s decision, but we could be in for a lower-for-longer oil price scenario.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Theophilos Argitis", "title": "Rate cut necessary to shore up confidence amid coronavirus shock, Bank of Canada's Poloz says", "description": "Virus impact combined with domestic headwinds could lead to slower growth through first two quarters, and possibly even further, Poloz said", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/poloz-says-canada-rate-cut-needed-to-shore-up-confidence?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stephen-poloz-3.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 5, 2020 1:18 PM EST", "content": "Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz justified his decision to slash interest rates on Wednesday as a confidence-boosting measure that can help \u201cbridge\u201d the fallout from the coronavirus.The impact of the shock combined with domestic headwinds could lead to slower growth through the first two quarters of this year, and possibly even further if the downturn undermines confidence, Poloz said in a speech on Thursday, a day after the central bank cut its policy rate by half a percentage point.\u201cThere is a real risk that business and consumer confidence will erode further, creating a more persistent slowdown, especially given recent declines in stock markets,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks of the speech. \nCoronavirus testing post-crisis maxim that rate cuts alone can buoy markets\nThe case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy\nBank of Canada cuts rate by half point, stands ready to cut more in face of coronavirus threat\nWednesday\u2019s cut marked a reversal for Poloz, who had been one of the few central bankers over the past year to resist lowering borrowing costs \u2014 in part because of concern cuts would fuel the nation\u2019s high household debt levels.

Poloz Thursday put much of the emphasis on a major unknown: the impact the crisis could have on broader confidence levels.\u201cIt is possible that the global economy will snap back quickly after the health professionals have managed the situation and conditions have returned to normal,\u201d Poloz said. \u201cHowever, the outbreak and its effects could be more persistent. Consumer and business confidence could be set back for a longer period of time, causing economic growth to slow more persistently.\u201dPoloz\u2019s speech is what the central bank calls its Economic Progress Report, in which it aims to provide insight into deliberations following the rate decisions that aren\u2019t accompanied by new forecasts.

Stocks dropped while the 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1 per cent. \nThe case for responsible fiscal stimulus as coronavirus threatens to choke the economy\nCanadian companies ramp up coronavirus precautions with travel restrictions, work-at-home options\nFalling victim to market fear may do more damage to your portfolio than the coronavirus itself\nBank of America has predicted that the global economy will see its weakest year since the financial crisis as the virus damages demand in China and beyond. Futures markets predict more rate cuts, with the Bank of Canada likely to lower its benchmark rate on Wednesday morning.But Picton sees higher rates down the road. He acknowledges that there will be a \u201csignificant interruption\u201d to the global economy, but is convinced it will end quickly and there will be a V-shaped recovery later in the year.The headwinds of the recent past \u2014 a trade war, tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and a lack of significant Chinese stimulus \u2014 have shifted as policy makers react to the virus threat, he said. When the outbreak subsides, there will be pent-up demand globally for goods and services, he added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-a360b82c1675074bdc9ec151fcb3978b-5ebca95de982b'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '//wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply(); /* compat for infinite scroll */ }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.addEventListener ) { document.addEventListener( 'readystatechange', function(){ \nif (document.readyState === 'complete') { \nfunc.apply(); \n} \n},  false ); }\n\t\t\telse if ( document.attachEvent ) { document.attachEvent( 'onreadystatechange', func ); }\n\t\t} )();\n\t\t\nThat is likely to be a powerful recipe for a move higher in most risk assets, including global equities, Picton said.\u201cThe coronavirus might have just delayed a powerful recovery phase that was beginning to develop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I think there will be a stimulus response that builds an even greater tailwind.\u201d1990s ReplayPicton Mahoney was one of the earlier entrants into the hedge fund market in Canada. One of the firm\u2019s oldest funds, a long-short equity fund, returned 8.25 per cent annualized since inception as of Jan. 31, outpacing the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index by more than two percentage points.Picton sees parallels between the current environment and the late 1990s. Back then, a period of turmoil \u2014 the Asian crisis and Russian default of 1997-98 \u2014 forced central banks to reverse course on a round of tightening.After the Fed cut in 1998, interest rates began rising again in 1999 as the global economy regained speed. Picton thinks the same thing will happen again.That means interest-rate sensitive investments will underperform as the recovery takes hold, said Picton, whose firm has about $7.5 billion (US$5.6-billion) in assets under management. The firm is shorting some rate-sensitive securities and buying derivatives that will pay off if rates go back up.And if its is indeed the late 1990s all over again, how else should investors play it?\u201cThe very simple answer is, take risk across all asset classes, understanding that you\u2019re probably in a giant poker game against everybody else who\u2019s doing the exact same thing,\u201d he said.Missing SignalsFor Picton, the sharp gains in government bonds is overdone and the correction in risk assets, especially in high-yield debt, is reflecting a near-term outlook of negative economic data.There is \u201cso much of a narrative that rates will not go up again that the bond market is somewhat missing on the plain signals that would have been picked up in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the bond market\u2019s going to get it right this time, like they did back in 2008 in the last recessionary phase.\u201dOne of his top picks is First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which has started the world\u2019s largest copper mine in the Panamanian jungle, in an environment where supply is probably less than demand growth, according to Picton.\u201cInventory\u2019s already low and more importantly there\u2019s no new projects that you can see on the horizon,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Todd White", "title": "Dow futures are pointing to 700 point leap at market open today after yesterday's plunge", "description": "Hopes of more central bank easing and moderate Joe Biden's surprise comeback bolsters mood", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/u-s-futures-gain-after-primaries-treasuries-flat-markets-wrap", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/trader-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "March 4, 2020 8:05 AM EST", "content": "American stock-index futures jumped with European equities on Wednesday as investors took in surprises from the U.S. Presidential primary and expectations of global policy responses to the coronavirus after the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut.

While it probably doesn\u2019t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent.The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it\u2019s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5 per cent to an all-time high this week \u2014 and that\u2019s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox\u2019s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85 per cent of its sales occur in the U.S. It\u2019s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox\u2019s cleaning products have held steady at US$460 million to US$570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging US$508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it\u2019s a pretty dry business. \nCoronavirus crash wipes $6 trillion off world stocks; TSX drops most in 5 years\nMarket panics like this one can be fertile ground for \u2018bottom-up\u2019 investors\nChance of Canadian supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus high: RBC\nBut the Centers for\u00a0Disease Control and Prevention is warning that\u00a0the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China\u2019s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now\u00a0threaten\u00a0the U.S. If that\u2019s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. \u201cSo far we\u2019re not seeing an uptick,\u201d Clorox CEO Benno Dorer\u00a0said during the company\u2019s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees\u00a0Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox\u2019s stock is already quite expensive, and it\u2019s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent.Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13 per centhigher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their \u201csell\u201d ratings on the stock after Clorox\u2019s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company\u2019s other product lines \u2014 bags and charcoal \u2014continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn\u2019t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it\u2019s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division \u201cgrilling\u201d to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn\u2019t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox\u2019s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it\u2019s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt\u2019s Bees lip care.)With this week\u2019s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak.\u00a0Clorox may play\u00a0its own\u00a0crucial role in combating the disease,\u00a0but its stock is already overheated.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Aoyon Ashraf", "title": "TSX ready for opening bell after early close yesterday over technical issue", "description": "Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/canada-stock-bourse-says-ready-for-friday-open-after-early-close", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tsx-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 28, 2020 7:06 AM EST", "content": "Canada\u2019s main stock exchanges said all systems are ready for the start of business on Friday after halting trading for hours due to a technical issue.The Toronto Stock Exchange said interruption was caused by a system capacity issue within the messaging technology component of TMX Group Ltd.\u2019s trading engine. The bourse said it has undertaken necessary measures to mitigate the risk of recurrence and that the incident was not the result of a cyber-security attack.Exchanges operated by TMX stopped trading shortly before 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday and did not re-open. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.9 per cent at the time.

At about 3:20 p.m. the company said its markets would remain closed for the rest of the day, leaving traders scrambling for alternatives. The three exchanges had seen 660 million shares traded up to that point, according to TMX Group\u2019s website.High VolumeThe halt comes in the midst of a week-long dive in global markets as anxiety over the spread of the coronavirus weighs on equities. Heavy selling may have contributed to the technical problem.In the first three days of the week, investors traded an average of 305 million shares a day in TSX Composite stocks, according to Bloomberg data. That is 41 per cent higher than the average daily volume in the three months ended Feb. 26.\u201cI don\u2019t know the inside of what happened at the TSX. What I can tell you is in the last couple of days we have seen a substantial increase in order flow, in our market also,\u201d said Jos Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., a competing exchange in Toronto. Schmitt made the comments in an interview on BNN Bloomberg television.TMX Group had also halted trading in all equity derivatives on the Montreal Exchange.To be sure, Canadian traders have the ability to divert some of their trades to rival exchanges such as Nasdaq Inc. and NEO Exchange. \u201cVolume does, when it can, move away from our primary market, the TSX, into alternative markets and they can trade,\u201d Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management, said on BNN Bloomberg. Volumes can decline due to technical issues \u201cbut it\u2019s not impossible to trade,\u201d she added.TMX Group has been hit by outages before. In April 2018, the TSX and its derivatives market shut down for more than two hours on a Friday afternoon. TMX said that failure was the result of a defective storage module.Caldwell said he thinks the event will raise hard questions for TMX Group. \u201cRest assured the commission are not going to give them a pass on this,\u201d he said, referring to the Ontario Securities Commission.

At his own Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which underperformed the stock market last year by the widest margin in a decade, an increase in repurchases might not be cause for celebration.Buffett has found little success deploying Berkshire\u2019s growing pile of cash. Its last big takeover, a US$37.2 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp., was more than three years ago. This year, the conglomerate was outbid for a tech company. Berkshire\u2019s struggle to find well-priced takeovers led it to open another path for putting money to work: The company loosened its buyback policy almost two years ago, but has repurchased only US$4.1 billion of its shares since then.\u201cWe\u2019re gradually getting more pessimistic about using our money,\u201d Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said in an interview last week. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we bought anything.\u201d \nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire dips into ETF market with two bets for a pension plan\nThe gospel according to Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger: lower your expectations\nWarren Buffett finally has dinner with Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur who paid $4.57-million for the opportunity\nBuybacks haven\u2019t made much of a dent in Berkshire\u2019s record US$128-billion mountain of money either, weighing on its stock price because, as Buffett himself says, the funds earn \u201conly a pittance.\u201d Berkshire investors will be scouring Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, set for release Saturday, for clues about his strategy after a year of missed deals and shares that rose at a slower pace than the S&P 500 Index \u2014 their worst underperformance since 2009.We're gradually getting more pessimistic about using our moneyCharlie Munger \n \n\u201cThey just aren\u2019t buying back a lot of stock, they aren\u2019t putting a lot of money to work in public securities, they\u2019re not buying portfolio companies outright,\u201d Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview. \u201cThe cash balance continues to grow.\u201dNo ElephantsWhile 2019 wasn\u2019t the year for an \u201celephant-sized acquisition,\u201d Buffett was hunting. Berkshire reportedly passed on Tiffany & Co. but did make an offer for Tech Data Corp., ultimately losing out to private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc.The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also spent the last few months of the year plowing money into stocks new to its portfolio, taking stakes in Kroger Co. and Biogen Inc. Even that did little to chip away at Berkshire\u2019s cash hoard, and it was still a net seller of stocks in the fourth quarter.Buffett\u2019s letter will be released alongside Berkshire\u2019s annual report, which will include quarterly results for his sprawling company. Operating earnings probably rose in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, according to Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Berkshire\u2019s net-income figure now factors in swings in the US$220-billion stock portfolio, volatility that Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore.As for acquisitions, Buffett for years has stressed patience, with prices for good businesses becoming \u201csky-high.\u201d Last year, the S&P 500 Index notched its biggest gain since 2013. Waiting for markets to turn might be the wisest course for Buffett, according to Shields.\u2018Do Nothing\u2019\u201cThe right thing to do is to do nothing if the potential acquisitions are overpriced,\u201d Shields said in an interview.As to whether the challenging environment for acquisitions could mean more Berkshire share buybacks in the future, Munger provided no guidance in last week\u2019s interview, following the annual meeting of his Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles.\u201cWho can tell?\u201d he said.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says\u201cFireworks on the corporate front in conjunction with Berkshire\u2019s announcement of 4Q earnings are unlikely, in our view. Berkshire didn\u2019t make any major acquisitions in the past three months, and share repurchases were probably modest in the quarter.\u201d\u2013Matthew Palazola, senior analystWhile the Oracle of Omaha may address the frustrations of dealmaking and investing in 2019, Buffett often uses the letter as a platform to delve into a wider range of issues too, including the economy, politics and investment fees.Here are some other topics that might come up in the letter:Kraft HeinzOver the past year, a massive writedown, management changes and a regulatory probe at the packaged-food giant caused turmoil for Berkshire, its biggest shareholder. More recently, Kraft Heinz was downgraded to junk by some credit-rating companies, which has weighed on its stock.Following a delay related to the problems at Kraft Heinz, Berkshire\u2019s portion of its earnings are once again included in the conglomerate\u2019s results. Buffett\u2019s company carried its Kraft Heinz stake at a value of US$13.8 billion on its balance sheet at the end of September, almost US$4.7 billion more than the market price at the time. The conglomerate said it\u2019ll continue to monitor the investment for impairment, but didn\u2019t think it was required then.\u201cI have thought they have needed to write down the value of the asset for several quarters now,\u201d Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview. \u201cI am surprised and dismayed that the carrying value has not been reconciled to reality.\u201dGeicoBuffett\u2019s company famously keeps a relatively tight corporate staff, with just 26 employees in the office, so any reshuffling of duties tends to attract investor attention. Late last year, Berkshire named Todd Combs, who helps Buffett oversee investments, to run auto insurer Geico, in addition to his role managing at least US$14 billion in stocks. While Buffett\u2019s deputy worked at Progressive Corp. years ago, most of his career has been spent managing investments.\u201cThat was a really surprising appointment,\u201d said Shanahan of Edward Jones. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t have that kind of experience \u2014 not only running a large organization, but running an insurance company.\u201dCombs knows a lot about auto insurance so the appointment made sense, according to Munger. The auto insurer will increasingly need to figure out how to navigate changing technology, such as artificial intelligence for underwriting, Munger said.Geico has also been facing pressure from rivals including Progressive, which sparked a question from a shareholder at last year\u2019s annual meeting about how Geico stacked up to its competitor. Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance operations at Berkshire, said Geico has \u201csignificant\u201d advantages in terms of controlling expenses, but that Progressive is better at managing losses.\u201cGeico is very aware of this disadvantage on the loss ratio that they are suffering, and they\u2019re very focused on trying to bridge that gap as quickly as they can,\u201d Jain said at the time.Geico ended up tweaking its strategy last year, building out capabilities long championed by Progressive and Allstate Corp. Geico introduced a telematics offering, which connects cars and phone apps to track drivers\u2019 habits.SuccessionBuffett\u2019s letter always spurs questions about succession for the 89-year-old CEO and his 96-year-old business partner Munger. In 2018, Berkshire appointed two key lieutenants, Jain and Greg Abel, to its board, promotions that Buffett said at the time were movements toward succession.Buffett hasn\u2019t publicly named his successor, a fact that ramps up speculation around any public announcements. Many investors have been focusing on Abel, whose mandate includes overseeing all of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance businesses. Those responsibilities put him in charge of companies from the sprawling energy empire he led for years to retailers Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candies and apparel brands Fruit of the Loom and Brooks Sports.PoliticsBuffett has been carefully navigating the increasingly bifurcated U.S. political climate in recent years. While he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he has yet to endorse a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential race, though he has expressed support for Michael Bloomberg, who\u2019s seeking the Democratic nomination. (Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Buffett\u2019s 2019 letter contained a carefully worded section on how U.S. prosperity has been achieved in a bipartisan manner. He might take a similar approach this year.\u201cHe may say something thinly veiled within the context of the American system and preserving the American system of capitalism,\u201d CFRA\u2019s Seifert said. \u201cHe runs a very large, globally interconnected company. It\u2019s probably not a bad idea for him to be measured in what he says.\u201dBloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Doug Alexander", "title": "Manulife, Sun Life get boost from surging stock market while Asia weighs on outlook", "description": "Manulife and Sun Life Financial each posted a 10 per cent gain in underlying quarterly earnings thanks to improving equity markets", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/manulife-sun-life-get-boost-from-surging-stock-market-while-asia-weighs-on-outlook", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/manulife.jpg", "publishedAt": "February 13, 2020 10:27 AM EST", "content": "The surging stock market is serving two of Canada\u2019s largest life insurers well.Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. each posted a 10 per cent gain in underlying quarterly earnings as improving equity markets helped their asset-management divisions, and Sun Life\u2019s fourth-quarter profit beat analysts\u2019 expectations.

But the largest Canadian lifecos have significant exposure to businesses outside of their home market. Manulife generated about 62 per cent of its 2018 revenue internationally, while Sun Life made almost 45 per cent of its sales in Asia and the U.S., according to Bloomberg data.\u201cThe relatively higher earnings generation outside of Canada that lifecos offer could become more appealing,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Dechaine.

The price-to-earnings ratio for Canadian life insurers sits at 9 times compared to banks at 10 times, but Dechaine warns that the comparison is skewed by Manulife, which is the cheapest stock in the group.

Investing isn\u2019t supposed to be easy.\u201dThe Debate Over Whether to Call It QE Is Over, and the Fed LostWhile economists only see a 30 per cent chance of a U.S. recession in 2020, Rosenberg said a retreat in spending on restaurants, movies and furnishings and other discretionary spending are harbingers of a slowdown, along with a deceleration in U.S. core inflation.\u201cWhen you stop hearing \u2018where are we going for dinner tonight?\u2019 and instead you start hearing \u2018who\u2019s cooking dinner?\u2019 then you know that a new form of frugality is taking place.\u201dHere\u2019s how he\u2019s battening down the hatches in his model portfolio:Gold\u201cGold is a place you want to be. I think that it\u2019s partly because its inversely correlated with interest rates. But it\u2019s also an insurance policy when things go wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a no-brainer, but this is close.\u201dBullion is off to a roaring start this year as strategists from Goldman Sachs to UBS Group AG called for $1,600 an ounce even before the Iranian crisis impacted global markets. The yellow metal has gained about a third since August 2018 and was trading around $1560 per ounce Monday.JapanJapan\u2019s stock market is one that\u2019s a \u201cblind hold\u201d for Rosenberg. Female participation rates have risen to levels higher than the OECD average and the nation has opened its doors to foreign labor. The country has also pushed companies to distribute dividends, introduce and/or expand share buybacks and have allowed for foreigners on corporate boards as shareholder activism picks up. \u201cThis is revolutionary in Japan.\u201dBonds in DragBond-proxies in the stock market, or what Rosenberg calls \u201cbonds in drag\u201d are also good investments as the economy heads into a downturn. Utilities, REITs and pipelines, which he calls asset-backed cash flow generators, are worth holding.\u201cIt\u2019s really more about putting together a portfolio of stocks \u2014 non-cyclical, liquid, strong balance sheets, with not much of a refinancing calendar that have been able to increase their dividends,\u201d he said.\u201cDownright cheap\u201d energy stocks are also favoured by Rosenberg. \u201cEnergy stocks are not priced for WTI where we are right now. They are priced for something that\u2019s gotta be at least 20 per cent \u2013 30 per cent lower.\u201dDefence stocks are a cheaper way to boost exposure to tech as countries beef up military spending. \u201cDefence is actually a technology. You can buy it at a lower multiple. Everybody is spending more money on military. The one thing that Trump has done, he\u2019s done a lot of stuff, he has successfully pressured the NATO allies to spend more on military.\u201dEnd GameThe Fed\u2019s asset purchases have created \u201cso much liquidity\u201d in global markets that it should be concerned, Rosenberg said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some other solution than just the Fed expanding its balance sheet in perpetuity,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what\u2019s creating this bubble.\u201dThe U.S. and Canadian economies will slow and central banks will cut interest rates. Eventually, the Fed will have to print money and the Treasury will have to distribute it to the public to stimulate growth \u2014 the so-called \u201chelicopter drop\u201d of money.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an end game and it is the magical money tree,\u201d he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Divya Balji", "title": "Stock bulls keep calm in Canada, look past flare-up in Iran tensions", "description": "Canada's stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November last week, after reaching a fresh record Thursday", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/investing/stock-bulls-keep-calm-in-canada-shaking-off-iranian-tensions?video_autoplay=true", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tsx.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 10, 2020 8:56 PM EST", "content": "If you\u2019ve only just come back from your holiday break and looked at equity markets, you\u2019d think nothing bad happened last week.Canada\u2019s stock benchmark posted its biggest weekly climb since November after reaching a fresh record Thursday, while the S&P 500 rose almost 1 per cent.

That was a dramatic reversal after the regime spent days accusing Western governments of \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201dWeaker-than-expected jobs data from the U.S. did little to alter investor views that the economy remains fundamentally sound, while Canada\u2019s rebound in employment backed the central bank\u2019s view that the labour force continues to be resilient.That left equity bulls still in charge as they continue to look past the flare-up in tensions with Iran and focus on the potential for a pickup in global economic growth. And Canada is still listed as one of the four markets at the top of Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s global equity scorecard for 2020.EconomyCanadian jobs data released Friday showed employment rebounded in December after two straight months of declines. Employment grew by 320,300 this year, the second-most since 2007.\u201cThe small December rebound keeps the 3-month moving average in negative territory at -13K, which implies a slowdown in hiring after a year of strong gains,\u201d said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.

The implications for Canada are uncertain. It\u2019s not clear whether any more of the new tariffs imposed on China will be rolled back, and there are worries the U.S. could turn its focus to the European Union, he said. A lot of damage has already been done, and these losses from the trade conflict are likely to be permanent even if growth picks up.\u201cIt is understandable that companies are reluctant to make big investments in this setting,\u201d Poloz said in prepared remarks provided to reporters. \u201cOn the surface, there has been some improvement on this front lately, although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to a recovery of trade and investment.\u201d \nWeak loonie, low borrowing costs to create \u2018tug of war\u2019 for business investment in 2020: Deloitte\nSaddled with huge levels of debt, Canadians remain fearful a recession is looming\nForecasting Canada\u2019s economic future is now about risk management, not one-way bets\nThe remarks come two weeks before the Bank of Canada\u2019s first interest rate decision of the year, on Jan. 22. Poloz ended 2019 with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies at 1.75 per cent, and is expected to hold that title until his seven-year term ends in June. The Bank of Canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend: the nation\u2019s inflation has been near its 2 per cent target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fuelling further some of the highest household debt levels in the world.In the remarks, Poloz cited four key areas that are top of mind for the Bank of Canada ahead of the decision: global trade policy developments, labour and housing markets, assessment of the economy\u2019s capacity following investment revisions, and recent moves in financial markets.Damage DoneOn trade, Poloz said the central bank estimates global GDP this year will be about 1 per cent lower due to trade conflicts. Another consideration for policy makers is measuring the impact of the trade disputes on the non-export sectors.\u201cWe are looking to see the extent to which weakness from manufacturing may be spreading to services, employment, consumer spending or housing,\u201d said Poloz. \u201cIn this regard, the most recent data have been mixed, so we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dOutside of trade, Poloz said the country\u2019s labour market has shown a healthy trend over the past year, even with the recent employment slowdown, citing recent wage growth. The Bank of Canada, however, will be carefully watching whether a recent moderation in job gains persists. The strong labour market, meanwhile, along with rising population, has been supporting the nation\u2019s housing market, the central banker said, adding policy makers will be watching for signs of froth returning to certain major markets.Another area of focus has been recent upward revisions to investment data that is prompting the central bank to reassess how quickly the nation\u2019s economy can grow in the future without fuelling inflation, Poloz said.On financial markets signals, Poloz said the inversion of the yield curve last year didn\u2019t lead to a recession as some feared. In a period of low interest rates, that indicator may no longer be a good indicator of recessions, he said. Also recent stock market gains suggest markets are taking a relatively positive view of the prospects for corporate earnings, despite the uncertainty, he said.Bloomberg.com"}, {"source": {"id": "fp-bloomberg-news", "name": "Bloomberg News From FP"}, "author": "Ben Steverman", "title": "Bill Gates, whose fortune stands at $113 billion, is pushing for higher taxes on the rich", "description": "'I think the rich should pay more than they currently do, and that includes Melinda and me'", "url": "https://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/bill-gates-whose-fortune-stands-at-113-billion-is-pushing-for-higher-taxes-on-the-rich", "urlToImage": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bill-gates.jpg", "publishedAt": "January 3, 2020 12:01 PM EST", "content": "Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates started the last decade worth more than US$50 billion and a pledge to donate a big chunk of his fortune to charity.By the end of it, he\u2019d given billions of dollars to fight poverty and improve health care and education.
